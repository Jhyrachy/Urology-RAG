3.13.4.6. Bladder augmentation. In patients where conservative treatment including onabotulinum toxin A (for indication see 3.12.4.3) fails to keep a low-pressure reservoir with a good capacity and compliance, bladder augmentation should be offered. For augmentation, ileal and colonic segments can be used [816]. Gastric segments are rarely used due to its associated complications like the haematuria-dysuria syndrome as well as secondary malignancies, which arise earlier than with other intestinal segments [817-820]. Enterocystoplasty increases bladder capacity, reduces storage pressure and can improve UUT drainage [821]. A good socially acceptable continence rate can be achieved with or without additional bladder outlet procedures [822]. In those, who are not able to perform CIC through the urethra, a continent cutaneous channel should be offered. One recent study in 10 patients showed that thoracic epidural analgesia appears to be a safe and effective opioid sparing option to assist with postoperative pain management following lower urinary tract reconstruction [823]. Surgical complications and revision rate in this group of patients is high. The 30-day all over event rate in the American College of Surgeonsâ€™ National Surgical Quality Database is approximately 30% (23-33%) with a re-operation rate in this short time period of 13% [824,825]. In these patients with long-life expectancy the complication rate clearly increases with the follow-up period [826]. The ten-year cumulative complication incidence from the Paediatric Health Information System showed a rate of bladder rupture in up to 6.4%, small bowel obstruction in up to 10.3%, bladder stones in 36%, pyelonephritis in more than a third of the patients and a re-augmentation rate of up to 13% [827]. Bladder perforation, as one of the worst complications, occurs in 3-13% [828]. The rate of VP-shunt infections after gastrointestinal and urological procedures ranges between 0-22%. In a recent study, bowel preparation seems not to have a significant influence on the infection rate (10.5% vs. 8.3%) [829]. Not only surgical complications must be considered; also metabolic complications and consequences after incorporating bowel segments have to be taken into account, such as imbalance of the acid base balance, decrease in vitamin B12 levels and loss of bone density. Stool frequency can increase as well as diarrhoea after exclusion of bowel segments [830] and last, but not least, these patients have a lifelong increased risk to develop secondary malignancies [831,832]. Therefore, a lifelong follow-up of these patients is required including physical examination, US, blood gas analysis, (pH and base excess), renal function and vitamin B12 if Ileum is used. Endoscopic evaluation starting ten years after augmentation is not cost-effective [833,834], but may prevent some advanced cancer. Woodhouse et al. do not recommend cystoscopy within the first fifteen years after surgery [835]. The real value of annual cystoscopic evaluation has not been proven by any study. Urodynamic studies after bladder augmentation are only indicated, if upper tract dilatation and/or incontinence after the operation has not improved [836]. Adverse effects of intestinal cystoplasties can be avoided by the use of ureterocystoplasty. The combination of a small contracted bladder, associated with a severe dilation of the ureter of a non-functioning kidney is quite rare. The technique was first described in 1973 by Eckstein [837]; the success rate depends on patient selection and the re-augmentation rate can reach 73% [838,839]. Auto-augmentation with partial detrusorectomy or detrusormyotomy creating a diverticulum avoids metabolic complications with the use of intestinal segments. The reports are conflicting, therefore, it may be used in selected cases [840-843]. For a successful outcome, a pre-operative bladder capacity of 75-80% of the expected volume seems necessary [841,844]. Seromuscular cystoplasty has also not proven to be as successful as standard augmentation with intestine [845]. Tissue engineering, even if successful in vitro and some animal models, does not reach the results by using intestinal segments with a higher complication rate [846,847]. Therefore, these alternatives for bladder augmentation should be considered as experimental and should be used only in controlled trials.
