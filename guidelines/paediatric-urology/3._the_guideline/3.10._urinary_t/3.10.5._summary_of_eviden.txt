3.10.5. Summary of evidence and recommendations for the management of UTI in children. Summary of evidenceLEUrinary tract infection represents the most common bacterial infection in children less than 2 years of age. The incidence varies depending on age and sex.1bClassifications are made according to the site, episode, severity, symptoms and complicating factors. For acute treatment, site and severity are most important.2bThe number of colony forming units (cfu) in the urine culture can vary, however, any colony count of one specimen indicates a high suspicion for UTI.2bDue to increasing resistance numbers good antibiotic stewardship should guide the choice of antibiotics, taking into account local resistance patterns, old urine cultures (when available) and clinical parameters.2aPreventive measures against recurrent UTIs include: chemoprophylaxis (oral and intravesical), cranberries, probiotics and Vitamin A and E.2aUrinalysis by dipstick yields rapid results, but it should be used with caution. Microscopic investigation is the standard method of assessing pyuria after centrifugation.2aDuring acute UTI both DMSA and diffusion-weighted MRI can confirm pyelonephritis or parenchymal damage.2a RecommendationsLEStrength ratingTake a medical history, assess clinical signs and symptoms and perform a physical examination to diagnose children suspected of having a urinary tract infection (UTI).3StrongExclude bladder- and bowel dysfunction in any toilet-trained child with febrile and/or recurrent UTI.3StrongClean catch urine can be used for screening for UTI. Bladder catheterisation and suprapubic bladder aspiration to collect urine can be used for urine cultures.2aStrongDo not use plastic bags for urine sampling in non-toilet-trained children since it has a high risk of false-positive results.2aStrongMidstream urine is an acceptable technique for toilet-trained children.2aStrongThe choice between oral and parenteral therapy should be based on patient age; clinical suspicion of urosepsis; illness severity; refusal of fluids, food and/or oral medication; vomiting; diarrhoea; non-compliance; complicated pyelonephritis.2aStrongTreat febrile UTIs with four to seven day courses of oral or parenteral therapy.1bStrongTreat complicated febrile UTI with broad-spectrum antibiotics.1bStrongOffer long-term antibacterial prophylaxis in case of high susceptibility to UTI and risk of acquired renal damage and lower urinary tract symptoms.1bStrongIn selected cases consider dietery supplements as an alternative or add-on preventive measure.2aStrongIn infants with febrile UTI use renal and bladder ultrasound to exclude obstruction of the upper and lower urinary tract within 24 hours.2aStrongIn infants, exclude vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) after first epidose of febrile UTI with a non-E. Coli infection. In children more than one year of age with an E. Coli infection, exclude VUR after the second febrile UTI.2aStrong
