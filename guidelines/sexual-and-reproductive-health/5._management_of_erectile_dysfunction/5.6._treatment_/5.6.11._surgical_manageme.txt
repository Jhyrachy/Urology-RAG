5.6.11. Surgical management. 5.6.11.1. Surgery for post-traumatic arteriogenic ED In young patients with pelvic or perineal trauma, surgical penile revascularisation has a 60-70% long-term success rate [416,489]. The stenosis must be confirmed by penile pharmaco-arteriography. Corporeal veno-occlusive dysfunction is a contraindication to revascularisation. 5.6.11.2. Venous ligation surgery Venous ligation surgery for veno-occlusive dysfunction is no longer recommended because of poor long-term results [489]. 5.6.11.2.1. Penile prostheses The surgical implantation of a penile prosthesis may be considered in patients who i) are not suitable for different pharmacotherapies or prefer a definitive therapy; and, ii) do not respond to other treatment modalities (Figure 5) [490]. The two currently available classes of penile implants include inflatable (two- and three-piece) and semi-rigid devices (malleable, mechanical and soft flexible) [293,491-494]. There are currently no head to head studies comparing the different manufacturers’ implants, demonstrating superiority of one implant type over another [495]. Patients may prefer the three-piece inflatable devices due to the more “natural” erections obtained, although no prospective RCTs have compared satisfaction rates with both types of implants. The two-piece inflatable prosthesis can be a viable option among patients who are deemed at high-risk of complications with reservoir placements (e.g., previous abdominal surgery). Semi-rigid prostheses result in a firm penis, which may be manually placed in an erect or flaccid state and offer the advantage of a simple implant technique, as well as easy use for the patient [293,491-493]. Conversely, they can have the disadvantage of unnatural persistent erection and reduced concealability [493,496]. They may also be an option in men with limited manual dexterity. There are two main surgical approaches for penile prosthesis implantation: peno-scrotal and infrapubic [492,493,496,497]. A systematic review comparing the satisfaction and complication rates of the different surgical approaches has shown that there is no specific advantage between the two, but rather it is recommended that surgeons have knowledge of both techniques and are capable of tailoring the incision strategy for complex cases [498]. Regardless of the indication, prosthesis implantation has one of the highest satisfaction rates (92-100% in patients and 91-95% in partners) among the treatment options for ED with appropriate counselling [293,491,492,499-507]. Focused psychosexual counselling may improve sexuality and sexual well-being in both patients and their partners after penile implant surgery [508]. There is sufficient evidence to recommend this approach in patients who do not respond to less-invasive treatments due to its high efficacy, safety and satisfaction rate [509]. The two main complications of penile prosthesis implantation are mechanical failure and infection. Several technical modifications of the most commonly used three-piece prostheses (e.g., AMS 700CX/CXR™ and Titan Zero degree™) resulted in mechanical failure rates of < 5% after five years of follow-up [491,510,511]. Careful surgical techniques with appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis against Gram-positive and negative bacteria reduced infection rates to 2-3% with primary implantation in low-risk patients and high-volume centres [512-515]. The infection rate may be further reduced to 1-2% by implanting an antibiotic-impregnated prosthesis (AMS Inhibizone™) or hydrophilic-coated prosthesis (Coloplast Titan™) [491,512,516-519]. Methods that appear to decrease infection rates include using coated prosthesis and strictly adhering to surgical techniques and protocols that avoid prolonged wound exposure and minimise skin contact (i.e., no-touch technique). Techniques that might prevent penile prostheses infection but lack definitive evidence include the use of prolonged post-operative antibiotics (> 24 hours), shaving with clippers, and preparation with chlorhexidine-alcohol [520,521]. Identification and pre-treatment of patients who are colonised with nasal Staphylococcus aureus with mupirocin and chlorhexidine before surgery has been shown to reduce the incidence of post-operative surgical site infection from 4.4% to 0.9% RCT [522]. A large database-study has shown that diabetes mellitus is a risk factor for penile prostheses infection, highlighting the need for optimal patient selection [667]. Unfortunately, there are no RCTs determining the ideal and/or correct threshold of glycated haemoglobin that is acceptable prior to implant surgery in diabetic patients [523]. Also, there are no RCTs establishing the optimal or appropriate threshold of glycated haemoglobin deemed acceptable before implant surgery in diabetic patients [524]. A large-cohort, multicentre, retrospective analysis in men with diabetes who received a Coloplast Titan™ implant demonstrated that vancomycin plus gentamicin was the most efficacious combination of antibiotics used for implants dipping in terms of preventing postoperative infection and subsequent explantation and revision [525]. Prosthetic infection requires removal of the prosthesis and antibiotic administration. Alternatively, removal of the infected device with immediate salvage and replacement with a new prosthesis has been described using a wash-out protocol with successful salvages achieved in > 80% of cases [513,526-528]. An absolute recommendation on how to proceed after explantation in this setting cannot be given and must be focused on the pros and cons of salvage therapy after full consultation with the patient. Besides infection and mechanical failure, impending implant erosion involving the distal corpora, urethra, or glans can occur in 1-6% of cases after surgery [529]. Similarly, glans ischaemia and necrosis have been reported in about 1.5% of patients [529,530]. Risk factors for these serious complications are higher in those patients with significant vascular impairment, such as patients with diabetes, or who have undergone concomitant lengthening procedures.
