6.1. Prevalence, aetiology, and risk factors of bladder stones. Bladder stones constitute only approximately 5% of all urinary tract stones [701] yet are responsible for 8% of urolithiasis-related mortalities in developed nations [702]. The incidence is higher in developing countries [703]. The prevalence of bladder stones is higher in males, with a reported male-to-female ratio between 10:1 and 4:1 [704,705]. The age distribution is bimodal: incidence peaks at three years in children in developing countries [704,706], and 60 years in adulthood [705]. The aetiology of bladder stones is typically multi-factorial [705]. Bladder stones can be classified as primary, secondary, or migratory [707]. Primary or endemic bladder stones occur in the absence of other urinary tract pathology, typically seen in children in areas with poor hydration, recurrent diarrhoea, and a diet deficient in animal protein [708]. Secondary bladder stones occur in the presence of other urinary tract abnormalities, which include bladder outlet obstruction (BOO), neurogenic bladder dysfunction, chronic bacteriuria, foreign bodies (including catheters), bladder diverticula, and bladder augmentation or urinary diversion. In adults, BOO is the most common predisposing factor for bladder stone formation and accounts for 45-79% of vesical calculi [705,709-712]. Migratory bladder stones are those that have passed from the upper urinary tract where they formed and may then serve as a nidus for bladder stone growth. Patients with bladder calculi are more likely to have a history of upper tract stones and risk factors for their formation [713]. A wide range of metabolic urinary abnormalities can pre-dispose to calculi anywhere in the urinary tract, which is covered in more detail in Section 4. Metabolic Evaluation and Recurrence Prevention. There is a paucity of studies on the specific metabolic abnormalities that predispose to bladder stones. Bladder stones will form in 3-4.7% of men undergoing surgery for benign prostatic obstruction (BPO) [714,715], 19-39% and 36-67% of motor-incomplete and motor-complete spinal cord injury patients, respectively [716], and 2.2% of patients with long-term catheters [717]. Two research groups have identified that a larger intravesical protrusion of the prostrate is an independent risk factor for bladder stone formation in patients with BPH undergoing TURP [718,719]. Kim and colleagues additionally found older age and a lower Qmax to be predictive of bladder stones [718]. In men with chronic urinary retention secondary to BPO, the 24-hour urine of 27 men with bladder stones had a higher uric acid supersaturation (2.2 vs. 0.6 mmol/L, p < 0.01), lower magnesium (106 vs. 167 mmol/L, p = 0.01) and lower pH (5.9 vs. 6.4, p = 0.02) than the 21 men without bladder stones [713]. It is therefore likely that patients with these conditions who form bladder stones also have an abnormal urine composition which predisposes them to bladder stone formation. The metabolic abnormalities which predispose patients to form secondary bladder stones are poorly understood. Stone analysis of 86 men with a BPO-related bladder stone demonstrated that 42% had calcium-based stones (oxalate, phosphate), 33% had magnesium ammonium phosphate, 10% had mixed stones and 14% had urate stones [705]. Similar findings were reported in more recent studies [720-722] and it is therefore likely that multiple metabolic factors predispose patients to secondary bladder stone formation. Low urine volume (poor hydration) is the most consistently demonstrable abnormality [723-725]. As an outlet obstruction is more often absent in children than in adults, the aetiology is most likely quite different in this population. Twenty-four-hour urine analysis in children with endemic bladder stones is reported in two studies. Of 57 children in Pakistan, 89.5% had hypocitraturia, 49% had a low urine volume, 44% had hyperoxaluria and 42% had hypocalciuria [723]. Of 61 children in India, stone formers had higher urine calcium and uromucoid concentrations than controls [724]. One study from Thailand compared 24-hour urine analyses from children from a rural area with a high prevalence of bladder stones with those from an urban area: rural children had lower urine volumes and, despite equal calcium, oxalate, and uric acid concentrations, crystalluria with uric acid and calcium oxalate crystals was more prevalent in rural children [725].
