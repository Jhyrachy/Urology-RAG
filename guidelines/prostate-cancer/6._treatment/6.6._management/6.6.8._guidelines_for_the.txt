6.6.8. Guidelines for the first-line treatment of hormone-sensitive metastatic disease*. RecommendationsStrength ratingOffer immediate systemic treatment with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) to palliate symptoms and reduce the risk for potentially serious sequelae of advanced disease (spinal cord compression, pathological fractures, ureteral obstruction) to M1 symptomatic patients.StrongOffer short-term administration of an older generation androgen receptor (AR) antagonist to M1 patients starting LHRH agonist to reduce the risk of the ‘flare-up’ phenomenon.WeakAt the start of ADT offer luteinising hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) antagonists or orchiectomy to patients with impending clinical complications such as spinal cord compression or bladder outlet obstruction.StrongDo not offer AR antagonist monotherapy to patients with M1 disease.StrongDo not offer ADT monotherapy to patients whose first presentation is M1 disease if they have no contra-indications for combination therapy and have a sufficient life expectancy to benefit from combination therapy (≥ 1 year) and are willing to accept the increased risk of side effects.StrongOffer ADT combined with abiraterone acetate plus prednisone or apalutamide or enzalutamide to patients with M1 disease who are fit for the regimen.StrongOffer docetaxel only in combination with ADT plus abiraterone or darolutamide to patients with M1 disease who are fit for docetaxel.StrongOffer ADT combined with prostate radiotherapy (using doses up to the equivalent of 72 Gy in 2 Gy fractions) to patients whose first presentation is M1 disease and who have low volume of disease by CHAARTED criteria.StrongDo not offer ADT combined with surgery to M1 patients outside of clinical trials.StrongOnly offer metastasis-directed therapy to M1 patients within a clinical trial setting or a well-designed prospective cohort study.Strong *All the following statements are based on metastatic disease defined by bone scintigraphy and CT scan/MRI.
