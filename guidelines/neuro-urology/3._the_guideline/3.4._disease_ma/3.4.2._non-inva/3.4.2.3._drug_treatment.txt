3.4.2.3. Drug treatment. A single, optimal, medical therapy for neuro-urological symptoms is not always available. Commonly, a combination of different therapies (e.g. intermittent catheterisation and antimuscarinic drugs) is advised to prevent urinary tract damage and improve long-term outcomes, particularly in patients with a suprasacral SCI or MS [145,178-180]. Drug treatments are categorised depending on their mechanism of action and focus on storage or voiding symptoms. 3.4.2.3.1. Drugs for storage symptoms Antimuscarinic drugs: are the first-line choice for treating NDO, increasing bladder capacity and reducing episodes of UI secondary to NDO by the inhibition of parasympathetic pathways [134,181-187]. Antimuscarinic drugs have been used for many years to treat patients with NDO [185,186,188], and the responses of individual patients to antimuscarinic treatment are variable. Despite a meta-analysis confirming the clinical and urodynamic efficacy of antimuscarinic therapy compared to placebo in adult NDO, a more recent integrative review has indicated that the information provided is still too limited for clinicians to be able to match trial data to the needs of individual patients with SCI, mainly due to the lack of use of standardised clinical evaluation tools such as the American Spinal Injury Association bladder diary and validated symptoms score [186,189]. Higher doses or a combination of antimuscarinic agents may be an option to maximise outcomes in neurological patients [182,183,190-193]. However, these drugs have a high incidence of adverse events, which may lead to early discontinuation of therapy. Despite this, NDO patients have generally shown better treatment adherence compared to idiopathic DO patients [194]. Choice of antimuscarinic agent: Oxybutynin [134,182,183,185,186,195], trospium [186,192,196], tolterodine [197] and propiverine [186,198] are established, effective and well-tolerated treatments even in long-term use [185,186,199,200]. Darifenacin [201,202] and solifenacin [203] have been evaluated in NDO secondary to SCI and MS [186,201-203] with results similar to other antimuscarinic drugs. A pilot study using solifenacin in NDO due to PD showed an improvement in UI [204]. Fesoterodine, an active metabolite of tolterodine, has also been introduced; improving urodynamic variables in SCI, MS and PD patients [205,206]. Fesoterodine for SCI patients can diminish the magnitude and frequency of AD episodes [207]. Favourable results with the new drug imidafenacin have been reported in suprapontine as well as SCI patients [208,209]. Side effects: Controlled-release antimuscarinics have some minor side effects, e.g. dry mouth [210]. It has been suggested that different ways of administration may help to reduce side effects [211]. Imidafenacine has been safely used in neurological patients with no worsening of cognitive function [208]. Nevertheless, the potential risk of developing dementia should be taken into account [212]; consider switching to beta-3 agonists or other therapies if cognition is affected [213]. Beta-3-adrenergic receptor agonists Despite the increasing use of mirabegron in neuro urological patients, its role in these patients is still unclear [214,215]. In MS and SCI patients, with very short follow-up, mirabegron has not demonstrated any significant effect on detrusor pressure or cystometric capacity [69,216,217], despite the reported improvement in LUT symptoms and quality of life similar to antimuscarinics [215]. Cardiovascular safety in NDO population has been suggested in a placebo-controlled RCT [218]. A significant subjective improvement in NDO symptoms has also been reported using lower dosages of mirabegron in patients affected by CNS lesions without any negative effects on voiding function [219]. A standard dosage of 50 mg has been found effective with no worsening of cognitive function in patients with PD [220]. Vibegron treatments significantly improved maximum cystometric capacity, bladder compliance, and NDO in a retrospective cohort study [221], but more studies are needed to do a recommendation. Other drugs A SR found that desmopressin may be effective for treating nocturnal polyuria in MS patients; however, adverse events were common, with the included studies being heterogeneous and of low quality [222]. Combination therapy with mirabegron and desmopressin in MS patients has shown promising results; however, clinical experience is still very limited in neuro-urological populations [223,224]. In preliminary studies, improvements in daily incontinence rates, nocturia, daytime and 24-hour voids, as well as the low risk of adverse events, suggest that cannabinoids may be effective and safe in MS patients [225,226]. A concomitant improvement in NDO symptoms has been reported in male MS patients using daily tadalafil to treat neurogenic erectile dysfunction (ED) [227]. 3.4.2.3.2. Drugs for voiding symptoms Detrusor underactivity: Cholinergic drugs, such as bethanechol and distigmine, have been considered to enhance detrusor contractility and promote bladder emptying, but are not frequently used in clinical practice [228]. Only preclinical studies have documented the potential benefits of cannabinoid agonists for improving detrusor contractility when administered intravesically [229,230]. Decreasing bladder outlet resistance: Î±-blockers (e.g. tamsulosin, naftopidil and silodosin) seem to be effective for decreasing bladder outlet resistance, PVR and AD [231-235]. Increasing bladder outlet resistance: Several drugs have shown efficacy in selected cases of mild SUI, but there are no high-level evidence studies in neurological patients [134].
