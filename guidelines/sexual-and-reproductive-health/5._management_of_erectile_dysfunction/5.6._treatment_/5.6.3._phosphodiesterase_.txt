5.6.3. Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors. Four potent selective PDE5Is have been approved by the EMA for the treatment of ED [350]. The efficacy of all four PD5EIs in almost every subgroup of patients with ED has been successfully established [350-353]. Efficacy is defined as an erection, with rigidity, sufficient for satisfactory intercourse [343]. In addition, adverse events for the four PDE5Is are generally mild and self-limiting [354-358]. The pharmacokinetic data for all four PDE5Is and their associated adverse events are presented in Tables 10 and 11, respectively. The choice of PDE5I depends on the frequency of intercourse and the patient’s personal experience. Two meta-analyses demonstrated that ED patients who prioritise high efficacy should use sildenafil 50 mg whereas those who optimise tolerability should initially use tadalafil 10 mg [351,359]. 5.6.3.1. Sildenafil Sildenafil is administered in doses of 25, 50 and 100 mg. The recommended starting dose is 50 mg and should be adapted according to the patient’s response and adverse effects [360]. The window of effectiveness ranges from 30-60 minutes after administration [360] up to 12 hours [361]. In a 24-week dose-response study, improved erections were reported by 56%, 77% and 84% of general ED patients taking 25, 50 and 100 mg sildenafil, respectively, compared to 25% of men taking placebo [362]. Sildenafil also significantly improved patient scores for IIEF, sexual encounter profile question 2 (SEP2), SEP question 3 (SEP3), General Assessment Questionnaire (GAQ) and treatment satisfaction [362]. Furthermore, an orally disintegrating tablet (ODT) of sildenafil citrate at a dose of 50 mg has been developed, mainly for patients who have difficulty swallowing solid dosage forms. 5.6.3.2. Tadalafil Tadalafil is administered in on-demand doses of 10 and 20 mg or a daily dose of 5 mg. The recommended on-demand starting dose is 10 mg and should be adapted according to the patient’s response and adverse effects [363,364]. The window of effectiveness ranges from 30 minutes after administration (peak efficacy after approximately 2 hours) up to 36 hours [363]. In a twelve-week dose-response study, improved erections were reported by 67% and 81% of men with ED taking 10 and 20 mg tadalafil, respectively, compared to 35% of men taking placebo [363]. Tadalafil has also been shown to have a net clinical benefit in the short-term on ejaculatory and orgasmic functions in ED patients [365]. Data have also shown that 40% of men aged > 45 years were combined responders for ED and LUTS/BPH when treated with tadalafil 5 mg once daily, with symptom improvement after twelve weeks [366]. Therefore, its use may be considered in both patients with ED only and in patients also complaining of concomitant LUTS, and wishing to benefit from a single therapy [367]. 5.6.3.3. Vardenafil Vardenafil is administered in on-demand doses of 5, 10 and 20 mg. The recommended starting dose is 10 mg and should be adapted according to the patient’s response and adverse effects [356]. Vardenafil is effective from 30 minutes after administration [368], with one of three patients achieving satisfactory erections within 15 minutes of ingestion [369]. In a twelve-week dose-response study, improved erections were reported by 66%, 76% and 80% of men with ED taking 5, 10 and 20 mg vardenafil, respectively, compared with 30% of men taking placebo [356,370]. Vardenafil significantly improved patient scores for IIEF, SEP2, SEP3, and GAQ and treatment satisfaction. An orodispersable tablet (ODT) formulation of vardenafil has also been released [370]. The efficacy of vardenafil ODT has been demonstrated in several RCTs and did not seem to differ from the regular formulation [371-373]. 5.6.3.4. Avanafil Avanafil is administered in on-demand doses of 50, 100 and 200 mg [357]. The recommended starting dose is 100 mg taken as needed 15-30 minutes before sexual activity and the dose may be adapted according to efficacy and tolerability [357,358,374]. In a general ED population the mean percentage of successful sexual attempts resulting in intercourse were 47%, 58% and 59% for the 50, 100 and 200 mg groups, respectively, as compared with 28% for the placebo group [357,358]. A meta-analysis confirmed that avanafil had comparable efficacy with sildenafil, vardenafil and tadalafil [375]. 5.6.3.5. Continuous use of PDE5Is According to the EMA, a once-daily regimen with tadalafil 2.5 or 5 mg may be considered suitable, based on patients’ choice and physicians’ judgement. In these patients, the recommended dose is 5 mg, taken once daily at approximately the same time each day. Tadalafil, 5 mg once daily, provides an alternative to on-demand tadalafil for couples who prefer spontaneous rather than scheduled sexual activities or who anticipate frequent sexual activity, with the advantage that dosing and sexual activity no longer need to be linked. Regardless of the type of ED population, there is no clinically significant difference between a tadalafil treatment administered once daily vs. on-demand tadalafil [376]. Overall, treatment with tadalafil 5 mg once daily in men complaining of ED of various severities is well-tolerated and effective [377] and may improve EF among men who have a partial response to on-demand PDE5I therapy [378]. The appropriateness of the continuous use of a daily regimen should be re-assessed periodically [377,379].

Safety concerns for PDE5Is 5.6.3.6.1. Cardiovascular safety No RCTs or open-label studies have demonstrated an increase in myocardial infarction rates in patients receiving PDE5Is. None of the PDE5Is have an adverse effect on total exercise time or time-to-ischaemia during exercise testing in men with stable angina [350,380]. This EAU Guidelines panel agrees to maintain the recommendations provided by the 3rd Princeton Consensus Panel in terms of the prescription of all PDE5Is in patients with CVD or in those with high CV risk [319,321,322]. 5.6.3.6.2. Contraindications for the concomitant use of organic nitrates and nicorandil An absolute contraindication to PDE5Is is the concomitant use of any form of organic nitrate or NO donors including recreational use of amyl nitrite or nitrate (poppers). Concomitant use results in cGMP accumulation unpredictable falls in blood pressure and symptoms of hypotension [381-384]. Concurrent use of nicorandil and PDE5Is is contraindicated due to the potential of the nitric oxide donating properties of nicorandil to increase cGMP levels [385]. 5.6.3.6.3. Antihypertensive drugs Co-administration of PDE5Is with antihypertensive agents may result in small additive decreases in blood pressure, which are usually minor [319]. In general, the adverse event profile of a PDE5I is not worsened by a background of antihypertensive medication, even when the patient is taking several antihypertensive agents [386]. 5.6.3.6.4. Interactions with α-blockers Tadalafil 5 mg is currently the only licensed drug for the treatment of both ED and LUTS demonstrating overall good efficacy in relieving urinary symptoms and improving EF [367]. Therefore, treatment with tadalafil 5 mg should be considered in patients suffering from mild to moderate LUTS associated with ED either alone or in combination with α-blockers. Conversely, as both drugs are vasodilators a certain degree of caution has been observed for combination therapy with PDE5Is and alpha-blockers due to the potential cumulative effects on blood pressure described in some studies [361,369,387]. However, a meta-analysis concluded that a concomitant treatment with α-blockers [both non-uroselective (e.g., terazosin and doxazosin) and uro-selective (e.g., alfuzosin, tamsulosin and silodosin] and PDE5Is may produce changes in haemodynamic parameters, but it does not increase the rate of adverse events due to hypotension [387]. Therefore, there is no current limitation in the simultaneous use of α-blockers and PDE5I. 5.6.3.7. Management of non- or poor-responders to PDE5Is The management of non-responders depends upon identifying the underlying cause [388]. Clinicians should begin by ensuring that the medication has been properly prescribed, is being correctly used by the patient and that the patient has been using a licensed medication. Absorption of sildenafil, vardenafil and avanafil can be delayed by high-fat meals [389-391]. Timing is important and patients may be waiting either too short or too long after the medication before attempting sexual intercourse. Studies suggest that patient education can help salvage an apparent non-responder to a PDE5I [388,392-395]. After emphasising the importance of dose, timing, and sexual stimulation to the patient, EF can be effectively restored following re-administration of the relevant PDE5I [388,392,393]. Studies have demonstrated that hypogonadal patients not responding to PDE5Is may improve their response to PDE5Is after initiating testosterone therapy [85,343,396]. Therefore, if diagnostic criteria suggestive of testosterone deficiency are present, testosterone therapy may be more appropriate even in ED patients [3,85]. Limited data suggest that some patients might respond better to one PDE5I than to another [397], raising the possibility that, despite an identical mode of action, switching to a different PDE5I may be beneficial. However, no evidence for this has been reported in the available RCTs [398,399]. In refractory, complex, or difficult-to-treat cases of ED combination therapy should be considered as a first-line approach. Although the available data are still limited, combining PDE5I with antioxidant agents, Li-SWT or a vacuum erection device (VED) improves efficacy outcomes, without any significant increase in adverse events [400]. Similarly, the association of daily tadalafil with a short-acting PDE5I (such as sildenafil) leads to improved outcomes, without any significant increase in adverse effects [401]. 5.6.3.8. Topical/Intraurethral alprostadil The vasoactive agent alprostadil can be administered inside the urethra in two different formulations. The first delivery method is topical, using a cream that includes a permeation enhancer to facilitate the absorption of alprostadil (200 and 300 μg) via the urethral meatus [402,403]. Clinical data are still limited. Significant improvement compared to placebo was recorded for IIEF-EF domain score, SEP2 and SEP3 in a broad range of patients with mild-to-severe ED [404]. Adverse effects include penile erythema, penile burning, and pain that usually resolve within two hours of application. Topical alprostadil (VITAROSTM) at a dose of 300 μg is available in some European countries. Recently, a randomised cross-over clinical trial has shown that, compared to the standard administration route, direct delivery within the urethral meatus can increase efficacy and confidence among patients, without increasing adverse effects [405]. The second delivery method is by intra-urethral insertion of a specific formulation of alprostadil (125-1000 μg) in a medicated pellet (MUSE™) [229]. Erections sufficient for intercourse are achieved in 30-65.9% of patients. In clinical practice, it is recommended that intra-urethral alprostadil is initiated at a dose of 500 μg, as it has a higher efficacy than the 250 μg dose, with minimal differences with regards to adverse events. In case of unsatisfactory clinical response, the dose can be increased to 1000 μg [406-408]. Overall, the most common adverse events are local pain (29-41%) and dizziness with possible hypotension (1.9-14%). Penile fibrosis and priapism are rare (< 1%). Urethral bleeding (5%) and urinary tract infections (0.2%) are adverse events related to the mode of administration. Efficacy rates are significantly lower than for intracavernous pharmacotherapy [409], with 30% adherence to long-term therapy. Intraurethral pharmacotherapy provides an alternative to intracavernous injections in patients who prefer a less-invasive, although less-efficacious treatment.
