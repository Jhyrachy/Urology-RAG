8.4. Patient involvment in kidney cancer treatment. One RCT has indicated that patient involvement in reporting their symptoms during management of a variety of metastatic solid tumours, can improve clinical outcomes, including OS [666]. A large-scale global survey of patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC), identified geographic variations in patient education, experience, awareness, access to care, best practices, quality of life, and unmet psychosocial needs [667]. A total of 1,983 patients from 43 countries revealed that at diagnosis, 43% of all respondents had no understanding of their RCC subtype, 29% of all patients reported no involvement in their treatment decision and 96% of respondents reported psychosocial impacts, with only 50% disclosing it to their health care team, with 90% indicated they would be interested in participating in clinical trails.
