3.12. monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis – bedwetting. 3.12.1. epidemiology, aetiology pathophysiology monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis (ne), also known bedwetting, defined intermittent nocturnal incontinence. relatively frequent symptom children, 5-10% seven years age 1–2% adolescents. gender difference incidence: two boys one girl age . spontaneous yearly resolution rate 15% (at age), considered relatively benign condition . seven 100 seven-year-old bedwetting children continue wet bed adulthood. nocturnal enuresis considered primary child yet prolonged period dry (six months).
