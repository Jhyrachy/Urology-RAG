6.1. Estimating life expectancy and health status. 6.1.1. Introduction Evaluation of life expectancy and health status is important in clinical decision-making for early detection, diagnosis, and treatment of PCa. Prostate cancer is common in older men (median age 68) and diagnoses in men > 65 will result in a 70% increase in annual diagnosis by 2030 in Europe and the USA [433,434]. Active treatment mostly benefits patients with intermediate- or high-risk PCa and longest expected survival. In localised disease, over ten years life expectancy is considered mandatory for any benefit from local treatment and an improvement in CSS may take longer to become apparent. Older age and worse baseline health status have been associated with a smaller benefit in PCSM and life expectancy of surgery vs. AS [435]. Although in a RCT the benefit of surgery with respect to death from PCa was largest in men < 65 years of age (RR: 0.45), RP was associated with a reduced risk of metastases and use of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) also among older men (RR: 0.68 and 0.60, respectively) [436]. External beam RT shows similar cancer control regardless of age, assuming a dose of > 72 Gy when using intensity-modulated or image-guided RT [437]. Older men have a higher incidence of PCa and may be under-treated despite the high overall mortality rates [438,439]. Of all PCa-related deaths 71% occur in men aged > 75 years [440], probably due to the higher incidence of advanced disease and death from PCa despite higher death rates from competing causes [441-443]. In the USA, only 41% of patients aged > 75 years with intermediate- and high-risk disease received curative treatment compared to 88% aged 65–74 [444]. 6.1.2. Life expectancy Life expectancy tables for European men are available online: https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/. Survival may be variable and therefore estimates of survival must be individualised. Gait speed is a good single predictive method of life expectancy (from a standing start, at usual pace, generally over 6 meters). For men at age 75,ten-year survival ranged from 19% < 0.4 m/s to 87%, for ≥ 1.4 m/s [445]. Figure 6.1: Predicted Median Life Expectancy by Age and Gait Speed for males* [445]*Figure reproduced with permission of the publisher, from Studenski S, et al. JAMA 2011 305(1)50. 6.1.3. Health status screening Heterogeneity in performance increases with advancing age, so it is important to use measures other than just age or performance status (PS) when considering treatment options. The International SIOG PCa Working Group recommends that treatment for adults over 70 years of age should be based on a systematic evaluation of health status using the G8 (Geriatric 8) screening tool (see Table 5.7) [136]. This tool helps to discriminate between those who are fit and those with frailty, a syndrome of reduced ability to respond to stressors. Patients with frailty have a higher risk of mortality and negative side effects of cancer treatment [446]. Healthy patients with a G8 score > 14 or vulnerable patients with reversible impairment after resolution of their geriatric problems should receive the same treatment as younger patients. Frail patients with irreversible impairment should receive adapted treatment. Patients who are too ill should receive only palliative treatment (see Figure 5.3) [136]. Patients with a G8 score ≤ 14 should undergo a comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) as this score is associated with three-year mortality. A CGA is a multi-domain assessment that includes co-morbidity, nutritional status, cognitive and physical function, and social supports to determine if impairments are reversible [447]. A SR of the effect of geriatric evaluation for older cancer patients showed improved treatment tolerance and completion [448]. The Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) is another screening tool for frailty (see Figure 5.4) [449]. Although not frequently used in the cancer setting, it is considered to be a common language for expressing degree of frailty. The scale runs from one to nine, with higher scores indicating increasing frailty. Patients with a higher CFS score have a higher 30-day mortality after surgery and are less likely to be discharged home [450]. It is important to use a validated tool to identify frailty, such as the G8 or CFS, as clinical judgement has been shown to be poorly predictive of frailty in older patients with cancer [451]. 6.1.3.1. Co-morbidity Co-morbidity is a major predictor of non-cancer-specific death in localised PCa treated with RP and is more important than age [452,453]. Ten years after watchful waiting for PCa, most men with a high co-morbidity score had died from competing causes, irrespective of age or tumour aggressiveness [452]. Measures for co-morbidity include: Cumulative Illness Score Rating-Geriatrics (CISR-G) [454,455] (Table 5.8) and Charlson Co-morbidity Index (CCI) [456]. 6.1.3.2. Nutritional status Malnutrition can be estimated from body weight during the previous three months (good nutritional status < 5% weight loss; risk of malnutrition: 5–10% weight loss; severe malnutrition: > 10% weight loss) [457]. 6.1.3.3. Cognitive function Cognitive impairment can be screened for using the mini-COG (https://mini-cog.com/) which consists of three-word recall and a clock-drawing test and can be completed within five minutes. A score of ≤ 3/5 indicates the need to refer the patient for full cognitive assessment. Patients with any form of cognitive impairment (e.g., Alzheimer’s or vascular dementia) may need a capacity assessment of their ability to make an informed decision, which is an increasingly important factor in health status assessment [458-460]. Cognitive impairment also predicts risk of delirium, which is important for patients undergoing surgery [461]. 6.1.3.4. Physical function Measures for overall physical functioning include: Karnofsky score and ECOG scores [462]. Measures for dependence in daily activities include Activities of Daily Living (ADL; basic activities) and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL; activities requiring higher cognition and judgement) [463-465]. 6.1.3.5. Shared decision-making The patient’s own values and preferences should be considered as well as the above factors. A shared decision-making process also involves anticipated changes to QoL, functional ability, and a patient’s hopes, worries and expectations about the future [466]. Particularly in older and frail patients, these aspects should be given equal importance to disease characteristics during the decision-making process [467]. Older patients may also wish to involve family members, and this is particularly important where cognitive impairment exists. 6.1.4. Conclusion Individual life expectancy, health status, frailty, and co-morbidity, not only age, should be central in clinical decisions on screening, diagnostics, and treatment for PCa. A life expectancy of ten years is most commonly used as a threshold for benefit of local treatment. Older men may be under-treated. Patients aged 70 years of age or older who have frailty should receive a comprehensive geriatric assessment. Resolution of impairments in vulnerable men allows a similar urological approach as in fit patients.
