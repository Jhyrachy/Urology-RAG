6.3.1.3. Anastomotic urethroplasty in men with penile urethral strictures. Historically, the use of anastomotic urethroplasty in the management of urethral stricture disease has been discouraged due to the risk of chordee post-operatively [263,284]. Nevertheless, it has been performed in selected patients with very short strictures (usually < 1 cm) with 80-93% patency rate, with satisfactory QoL and sexual function and without any case of chordee [285] and with results comparable to augmentation urethroplasty [286]. Summary of evidenceLEStricture-free rates for single-stage penile augmentation urethroplasties range from 70%-100% for dorsal OMG augmentation, 67-100% for penile skin flap (PSF) augmentation, 55-92.6% for ventral OMG augmentation and 62-78% for dorsal SG augmentation. Overall stricture-free rates for staged OMG penile augmentation urethroplasties range from 70-100%.2bIn staged urethroplasties, an interval of at least four to six months has been proposed before proceeding to the tubularisation of the urethra, provided that the graft has healed uneventfully.4The use of anastomotic urethroplasty in the management of urethral stricture disease has been discouraged due to the risk of chordee post-operatively. Anastomotic urethroplasty can be offered in selected cases of very short (< 1 cm), injury-associated penile strictures.3In case of adverse intra-operative findings, a single-stage approach might not be feasible and must be converted into a staged approach.3 RecommendationsStrength ratingOffer men with penile urethral stricture disease augmentation urethroplasty by either a single-stage or staged approach taking into consideration previous interventions and stricture characteristics.StrongOffer an interval of at least four to six months before proceeding to the second stage of the procedure provided that outcome of the first stage is satisfactory.WeakDo not offer anastomotic urethroplasty to patients with penile strictures > 1 cm due to the risk of penile chordee post-operatively.StrongCounsel patients with penile strictures that single-stage procedures might be converted to staged ones in the face of adverse intra-operative findings.Strong
