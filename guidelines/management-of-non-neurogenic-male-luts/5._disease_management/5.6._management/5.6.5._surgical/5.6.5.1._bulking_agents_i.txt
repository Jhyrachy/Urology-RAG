5.6.5.1. Bulking agents in men. Mechanism of Action: Urethral bulking agents work by adding bulk and improving the coaptation of a damaged sphincter zone. They represent a treatment option for men with either small volume leak or for those unfit for more invasive treatment options [663]. Efficacy: A Cochrane review on surgical treatment of PPI identified only one RCT that fulfilled the inclusion criteria. This trial randomised 45 men to Macroplastique injection or artificial urinary sphincter (AUS) implantation and compared their outcomes at 48 months [663]. Significant improvement was reported in both groups for men with minimal incontinence, but in men with total incontinence there was a significant difference in continence rates favouring AUS implantation (72% vs. 23%) [664]. A SR of eight studies (n=142) in men using Macroplastique, Opsys, Durasphere and Urolastic, showed short-term improvement, and reported dry rates between 0-83% [663]. A propensity score-matched analysis of 104 men with PPI, compared submucosal injection of Macroplastique to transobturator male sling (TiLOOP male) [665]. At twelve months follow-up, the reported failure free rates were 15.4% and 76.9%, the daily use of 0-1 pads was 21.2% and 67.3% and the satisfaction rate was 3.8% and 71.2%, respectively. Several small cohort studies of several different bulking agents have not shown any benefit. A narrative review including data from 25 articles, reports a success rate with all bulking procedures of 54.3%, with 37.5% of symptoms improvement and almost 30% of dryness [666]. In a SR and meta-analysis, three studies addressed bulking agents. Two of them, involving a total of 384 participants, showed a pooled short-term cure rate of 26.1% and a single study on 68 subjects reported a 10.3% long term cure rate. Short- and long-term reoperation rates were not described [667]. Tolerability and safety: Bulking agent associated dysuria and haematuria are frequently reported to be transient and self-resolving [663]. The risk of urinary retention requiring clean intermittent self-catheterisation (CISC), or long-term catheter use is minimal [668]. However, they may provoke allergic reactions [669] and carry a potential risk for migration [670] to proximal and distal lymph nodes [671]. Overall, post procedural urinary retention rates range between 3-17%, with rare need for temporary catheterisation, while post-operatory UTIs ranged from 6-7% [666]. Practical considerations: Bulking agents have shown low cure rates but remain an option for men unfit for more invasive treatment options. Summary of evidenceLEThere is very limited evidence that bulking agents are effective for the treatment of PPI.2 RecommendationStrength ratingDo not offer bulking agents to men with post-prostatectomy incontinence.Weak
