Visual prostate symptom score A novel visual prostate symptom score (VPSS) has been prospectively tested vs. the IPPS and correlated positively with the IPSS score [142,143]. This visual score can be used as an option in men with limited literacy. 4.14.2. Micro-RNA The use of miR-221 has been shown to have the potential to be used as a biomarker and novel target in the early diagnosis and therapy of BPH [144].
