treatment failed aspiration . four categories shunt procedures reported . limited data available allow one procedure recommended another. however, distal shunts less invasive associated lower rates post-operative ed therefore recommended first surgical intervention choice (appendix 6 table 10.1). percutaneous distal (corpora-glanular) shunts winter’s procedure uses trucut biopsy needle create
