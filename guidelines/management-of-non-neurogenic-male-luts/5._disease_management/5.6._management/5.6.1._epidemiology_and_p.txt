5.6.1. Epidemiology and Pathophysiology. Urinary incontinence is defined as an unintentional loss of urine and is reported to have a prevalence of 11% in men aged 60 to 64 years old to 31% in men â‰¥ 85 years and to affect up to 32% of men with LUTS [587-589]. Urinary incontinence can be further classified into three types: SUI, UUI and mixed urinary incontinence (MUI). Overflow UI, post-micturition dribble, nocturnal enuresis, and total incontinence are specific forms of UI that are outside the current scope of this guideline. An overview of the epidemiology and pathophysiology of male UI is given in table 4. Table 4: Epidemiology and pathophysiology overview of male UI . TypeDefinitionCauses andassociated factorsPathophysiologyClinical presentationStress UI: prevalence< 10%Urine loss during movement, on effort or in general during increased abdominal pressure.Benign Prostatic Obstruction surgeryNeurogenic conditionPelvic surgeryRadical prostatectomyUrethral surgerySphincter deficiencySymptoms: UI during physical activity, exercises, e.g. during coughing, sneezing,no leakage during sleep, no nocturnal enuresisVoiding diary/Pad test: with activityCough stress test: leakage can coincide with coughingUrgency UI: prevalence 40-80%Urine loss concomitant or immediately following an urgency episode.Ageing processAnorectal dysfunction/GI disordersBehavioural factors (fluid intake and caffeine consumption)BPOIdiopathicIntrinsic bladder diseases (cystitis, fibrosis, interstitial cystitis)Metabolic syndrome [594]Neurogenic conditionsUTIsDetrusor overactivity (neurogenic or not)Urothelial stimulationIncreased afferent signallingOthers (pelvic organ cross talk, bladder wall ischemia etc.)Symptoms: usually associated with, increased frequency and nocturiaVoiding diary: urgency, frequency and nocturia, incontinenceMixed UI: prevalence 10-30%Any combination of SUI and UUI.Causes of both SIU and UUICombination of SUI and UUISymptoms: UI on effort and with a sense of urgencyVoiding diary: variableCough stress test: may show leakage with coughing BPO = benign prostatic obstruction; GI = gastrointestinal; SUI = stress urinary incontinence; UI = urinaryincontinence; UTI = urinary tract infection; UUI = urgency urinary incontinence
