5.2. Imaging investigations. Most renal tumours are diagnosed by abdominal US or CT performed for other medical reasons [98] (LE: 3). Renal masses are classified as solid or cystic based on imaging findings. 5.2.1. Presence of enhancement With solid renal masses, the most important criterion for differentiating malignant lesions is the presence of enhancement [107] (LE: 3). Traditionally, US, CT and MRI are used for detecting and characterising renal masses. Most renal masses are diagnosed accurately by imaging alone. 5.2.2. Computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging Computed tomography or MRI are used to characterise renal masses. Imaging must be performed unenhanced, in an early arterial phase, and in a parenchymal phase with intravenous contrast material to demonstrate enhancement. In CT imaging, enhancement in renal masses is determined by comparing Hounsfield units (HU) before, and after, contrast administration. A change of fifteen HU, or more, in the solid tumour parts demonstrates enhancement and thus vital tumour parts [108] (LE: 3). Computed tomography or MRI allows accurate diagnosis of RCC but cannot reliably distinguish oncocytoma and fat-free AML from malignant renal neoplasms [109-112] (LE: 3). Abdominal CT provides information on [113]: function and morphology of the contralateral kidney [114] (LE: 3);primary tumour extension;venous involvement;enlargement of locoregional LNs;condition of the adrenal glands and other solid organs (LE: 3). Abdominal contrast-enhanced CT angiography is useful in selected cases when detailed information on the renal vascular supply is needed [115,116]. If the results of CT are indeterminate, CEUS is a valuable alternative to further characterise renal lesions [117-120] (LE: 1b). Magnetic resonance imaging may provide additional information on venous involvement if the extent of an IVC tumour thrombus is poorly defined on CT [121-124] (LE: 3). In MRI, especially high-resolution T2-weighted images provide a superior delineation of the uppermost tumour thrombus, as the inflow of the enhanced blood may be reduced due to extensive occlusive tumour thrombus growth in the IVC. The T2-weighted image with its intrinsic contrast allows a good delineation [124]. Magnetic resonance imaging is indicated in patients who are allergic to intravenous CT contrast medium and in pregnancy without renal failure [124,125] (LE: 3). Magnetic resonance imaging allows the evaluation of a dynamic enhancement without radiation exposure. Advanced MRI techniques such as diffusion-weighted (DWI) and perfusion-weighted imaging are being explored for renal mass assessment [126]. Recently, the use of multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) to diagnose ccRCC via a clear cell likelihood score (ccLS) in SRMs was reported [127]. The ccLS is a 5-tier classification that denotes the likelihood of a mass representing ccRCC, ranging from ‘very unlikely’ to ‘very likely’. The authors prospectively validated the diagnostic performance of ccLS in 57 patients with cT1a tumours and found a high diagnostic accuracy. The diagnostic performance of mpMRI-based ccLS was further validated in a larger retrospective cohort (n = 434) across all tumour sizes and stages [128], and ccLS was found to be an independent prognostic factor for identifying ccRCC. For the diagnosis of complex renal cysts (Bosniak IIF–III) MRI may be preferable. The accuracy of CT is limited in these cases, with poor sensitivity (36%) and specificity (76%; κ = 0.11); MRI, due to a higher sensitivity for enhancement, showed a 71% sensitivity and 91% specificity (κ = 0.64). Contrast-enhanced US showed high sensitivity (100%) and specificity (97%), with a negative predictive value of 100% (κ = 0.95) [74]. In younger patients who are worried about the radiation exposure of frequent CT scans, MRI may be offered as alternative although only limited data exist correlating diagnostic radiation exposure to the development of secondary cancers [129]. A SR and meta-analysis [130] compared the diagnostic performance of CEUS vs. contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) and contrast-enhanced MRI (CEMRI) in the assessment of benign and malignant cystic and solid renal masses. Sixteen studies were included in the pooled analysis. The results suggested comparable diagnostic performance of CEUS compared with CECT (pooled sensitivity 0.96 [95% CI: 0.94-0.98], vs. 0.90 [95% CI: 0.86-0.93], for studies with a final diagnosis of benign or malignant renal masses by pathology), and CEUS vs. CEMRI (pooled sensitivity 0.98 [95% CI: 0.94-1.0], vs. 0.78 [95% CI: 0.66-0.91], for studies with final diagnosis by pathology report or reaffirmed diagnosis by follow-up imaging without pathology report). However, there were significant limitations in the data, including very few studies for CEMRI, clinical and statistical heterogeneity and inconsistency, and high risks of confounding. 5.2.3. Other investigations and emerging technologies Renal arteriography and inferior venacavography have a limited role in the work-up of selected RCC patients (LE: 3). In patients with any sign of impaired renal function, an isotope renogram and total renal function evaluation should be considered to optimise treatment decision-making [105,106] (LE: 2a). 18FDG Positron-emission tomography (PET) is not recommended in primary staging. [117,131] (LE: 1b). Emerging technologies for differentiation of RCC subtypes has a growing body of evidence with regard to prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positron emission tomography (PET)-CT [132], 99TC sestamibi SPECT/CT and 89Zr-DFO-Girentuximab PET-CT [39,40,133]. Additionally some of these modalities are being evaluated for staging purposes [40]. Currently, the level of published evidence is not sufficient in terms of external validation to allow any guideline recommedation to be made. 5.2.4. Radiographic investigations to evaluate RCC metastases Chest CT is accurate for chest staging [90,91,134-136] (LE: 3). Use of nomograms to calculate risk of lung metastases have been proposed based on tumour size, clinical stage and presence of systemic symptoms [137,138]. These are based on large, retrospective datasets, and suggest that chest CT may be omitted in patients with cT1a and cN0, and without systemic symptoms, anaemia or thrombocythemia, due to the low incidence of lung metastases (< 1%) in this group of patients. There is a consensus that most bone metastases are symptomatic at diagnosis; thus, routine bone imaging is not generally indicated [134,139,140] (LE: 3). However, bone scan, brain CT, or MRI may be used in the presence of specific clinical or laboratory signs and symptoms [139,141,142] (LE: 3). A prospective comparative blinded study involving 92 consecutive mRCC patients treated with first-line vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) (median follow-up 35 months) found that whole-body DWI/MRI detected a statistically significant higher number of bony metastases compared with conventional thoraco-abdomino-pelvic contrast-enhanced CT, with higher number of metastases being an independent prognostic factor for progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) [143]. The incidence of brain metastasis without neurological symptoms was retrospectively evaluated in 1,689 mRCC patients, selected to be included in 68 clinical trials between 2001-2013 [144]. All patients had a mandatory brain screening by CT/MRI. Seventy-two patients (4.3%) were diagnosed with occult brain metastases, of whom 39% multi-focal. Most patients (61%) were International Metastatic Renal Cancer Database Consortium (IMDC) intermediate risk and 26% were favourable risk. A majority (86%) of the patients had > 2 extracranial metastatic sites, including lung metastases in 92%. After predominantly radiotherapy, performed in 93% of patients, a median OS of 10.3 months (range 7.0–17.9 months) was observed. 5.2.5. Bosniak classification of renal cystic masses This system classifies renal cysts into five categories, based on CT imaging appearance, to predict malignancy risk [145,146] (LE: 3), and also advocates treatment for each category (Table 5.1). An updated Bosniak classification (2019) strengthened the classification and included MRI diagnostic criteria [75]; however, it requires further validation. According to a Meta-analysis based on 471 patients, the risk of maliganacy of Bosniak IIF-III, may be higher than with the old classification [147]. Until further validation, the imaging report should therefore identify which classification has been used. Lastly, the management of cystic renal tumours is also discussed in Section 3.5.8.
