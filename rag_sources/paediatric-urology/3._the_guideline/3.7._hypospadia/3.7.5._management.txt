3.7.5. management. 3.7.5.1. indication reconstruction therapeutic objectives differentiation functionally necessary aesthetically feasible operative procedures important therapeutic decision making. indications surgery are: proximally located (ectopic) meatus causing ventrally deflected spraying urinary stream;meatal stenosis;anterior curvature penis;cleft glans;rotated penis abnormal cutaneous raphe;preputial hood;penoscrotal transposition;split scrotum. physical examination check anatomic components penis evaluate degree nature abnormality component. examination evaluate location meatus, degree proximal spongiosal hypoplasia, presence degree penile curvature, width depth urethral plate, size glans, degree ventral skin deficiency, availability foreskin scrotal abnormalities like penoscrotal transposition bifid scrotum. surgical procedures carry risk complications, thorough pre-operative counselling caregiver crucial. achieve overall acceptable functional cosmetic outcome, penile curvature must corrected neo-urethra adequate size opening glans formed proper skin coverage penile shaft (le: 4) (figure 4). use magnifying spectacles fine synthetic absorbable suture materials (6.0-7.0) required. penile surgery, exceptional prudence adopted use cautery. bipolar cautery recommended. knowledge variety surgical reconstructive techniques, wound care post-operative treatment essential satisfactory outcome. 3.7.5.2. pre-operative hormonal treatment lack high-quality evidence support pre-operative hormonal treatment androgen stimulation improves surgical outcomes. yet, treatment form systemic testosterone, topical testosterone, derivatives like dihydrotestosterone (dht) hcg commonly used increase glans size pre-operatively allow better tubularisation urethral plate decrease incidence glans dehiscence. treatment usually limited patients proximal hypospadias, small appearing penis, reduced glans circumference reduced urethral plate . studies shown leads significant enlargement glans shaft penis (le: 1b) . moderate quality evidence three randomised studies demonstrate significantly lower rates urethracutaneous fistulae re-operation rates patients received pre-operative hormonal treatment . pre-operative testosterone administration often well tolerated. transient side effects child´s behaviour, increased genital pigmentation, appearance pubic hair, penile skin irritation redness, increased erections peri-operative bleeding reported, persistent side effects related hormonal stimulation reported literature. also evidence possible effects bone maturation . concerns regarding negative impacts testosterone wound-healing increased bleeding surgery. cessation therapy recommended one two months prior surgery avoid adverse effects surgery . 3.7.5.3. age surgery age surgery primary hypospadias repair usually 6-18 (24) months (le: 3). age surgery risk factor urethroplasty complication pre-pubertal tubularised incised plate urethroplasty (tip) repair (le: 2b). complication rate primary tip repair 2.5 times higher adults paediatric group according prospective controlled study (le: 2a). 3.7.5.4. penile curvature present, penile curvature often released degloving penis (skin chordee) excision connective tissue genuine chordee ventral aspect penis 70% . urethral plate well vascularised connective tissue cause curvature cases . residual curvature caused corporeal disproportion requires straightening penis, mostly using dorsal midline plication orthoplasty (modification nesbit plication without elevation neurovascular bundle). severe curvature (> 45°), often combined short urethral plate requiring transection, ventral penile lengthening recommended prevent shortening penis. consists ventral transverse incision tunica albuginea extending 3 9 o´clock position patched tunica vaginalis flap graft, several short ventral corporotomies without grafting (le: 2b) . ventral lengthening, shorter dorsal midline plication usually added. according retrospective study, dorsal plication remained significantly associated recurrent ventral curvature independently factors. ventral corporeal grafting severe penile curvature gives good long-term results safety profiles erectile function (le: 2b). 3.7.5.5. urethral reconstruction mainstay hypospadias repair preservation well-vascularised urethral plate use urethral reconstruction become standard practice hypospadias repair . mobilisation corpus spongiosum/urethral plate bulbar urethra decreases need urethral plate transection (le: 2b). urethral plate wide, tubularised following thiersch-duplay technique. plate narrow simply tubularised, recommended relaxing plate midline incision subsequent tubularisation according snodgrass-orkiszewski tip technique. technique become treatment choice distal- mid-penile hypospadias [331-334]. incision plate deep, recommended cover raw surface inner preputial (or buccal) inlay graft primary secondary repairs . also enables extension incision beyond end plate prevent meatal stenosis (le: 2a). distal forms hypospadias, range techniques available (e.g. mathieu, urethral advancement) (le: 2b). tip technique become option proximal hypospadias well [331-334,339]. however, urethral plate elevation urethral mobilisation combined tip repair results focal devascularisation neo-urethra symptomatic stricture development (le: 2b). onlay technique using preputial island flap standard repair, preferred proximal hypospadias, plate unhealthy narrow . onlay preputial graft option single-stage repair (le: 2b). continuity urethral plate cannot preserved, single two-stage repairs used. former, modification tubularised flap (duckett tube), tube-onlay inlay-onlay flap, onlay flap albuginea used prevent urethral stricture [342-344] (le: 3); alternatively koyanagi-hayashi technique used [345-348]. two-stage procedure become preferable past years lower recurrence ventral curvature favourable results variable long-term complication rates [337,342,349-353]. 3.7.5.6. re-do hypospadias repairs re-do hypospadias repairs, definitive guidelines given. above-mentioned procedures used different ways often modified according individual findings needs patient. figure 4: algorithm management hypospadiasdsd = disorders sex development; tip = tubularised incised plate urethroplasty; magpi = meatal advancement glanuloplasty incorporated. 3.7.5.7. penile reconstruction following formation neo-urethra following formation neo-urethra, procedure completed glansplasty reconstruction penile skin. shortage skin covering, preputial double-face technique placement suture line scrotum according cecil-michalowski used. countries circumcision routinely performed, preputial reconstruction considered. preputial reconstruction carries risk specific complications seem increase risk urethroplasty complications . tip repair, use preputial dartos flap reduces fistula rate (le: 2b). 3.7.5.8. urine drainage wound dressing urine drained transurethrally (e.g. dripping stent) suprapubic tube. drainage distal hypospadias repair another option . circular dressing slight compression, well prophylactic antibiotics surgery, established procedures (le: 4). post-operative prophylaxis hypospadias repair limited benefit reduces risk asymptomatic bacteriuria [357-359] (le: 2b). consensus duration stenting dressing. 3.7.5.9. outcome studies tried determine risk factors complications hypospadias repair. analysis prospectively collected data found glans size (width < 14 mm), proximal meatal location re-operation independent risk factors urethral complication . low surgeon volume independently increases risk fistula, stricture diverticulum repair (le: 3). meta-analysis complication rates tip repair found lower complication rates incidence re-operations primary distal repairs (in 4.5%) primary proximal repairs (in 12.2%) secondary repair (in 23.3%) [331-334,338,356]. one expect predictable outcome complication rates 10% distal hypospadias (fistula, meatal stenosis, dehiscence, recurrent ventral curvature, haematoma) . similar incidence fistula (3.4-3.6%) expected mathieu tip repairs distal hypospadias [339,363-365]. complication rates tip onlay repairs primary severe hypospadias similar, 24% 27%, respectively. higher free graft preputial island tube urethroplasty . strong evidence suggest use inlay grafts tip repair improves outcome . complication rates single-stage koyanagi hayashi modification repairs go 61%, according comparative study . staged buccal mucosa graft requires redo grafting 13% patients, second stage one third patients complications, mostly degree graft fibrosis . long-term study two-stage flap repair showed complication rate 68% ; another study showed re-operation rate 28% .
