5.1. primary lesion. 5.1.1. physical examination primary penile carcinoma usually clinically evident lesions often presenting raised ulcerous lesions locally destructive . critically important note appearance penile tumours heterogeneous sometimes hidden foreskin case phimosis. physical examination include inspection palpation entire penis (to identify potential skip lesions). dimensions, anatomic location, extent local invasion noted, assessment stretched penile length recommended. 5.1.2. imaging primary tumour physical examination reliable method estimating penile tumour size clinical stage . distinguishing t1 t2 disease, magnetic resonance imaging (mri) outperform physical examination. however, uncertainty tumour invades cavernosal bodies (ct3), organ-sparing treatment options (e.g., glansectomy) considered, mri helpful . sr showed sensitivity specificity mri predicting corporal invasion 80% (95% ci: 70–87%) 96% (95% ci: 85–99%), respectively . magnetic resonance imaging also provide useful information regarding resectability case large (t4) tumours invasion adjacent structures. magnetic resonance imaging without artificial erection showed similar accuracy local staging . mri available, penile ultrasound (us) considered . 5.1.3. penile biopsy: indications biopsy penile tumour obtained doubt exact nature lesion. however, even clinically obvious cases, histological information biopsy facilitate treatment decisions (such indications surgical staging). histological confirmation also necessary guide management treatment planned topical agents, radiotherapy laser surgery . technical histopathological considerations penile biopsy see section 3.4.6.
