3.15.4. Summary of evidence and recommendations for the management of vesicoureteric reflux in childhood. Summary of evidenceLEThere is no evidence that correction of persistent low-grade reflux (grades I-III) without symptoms and normal kidneys offers a significant benefit.3The traditional approach of initial medical treatment after diagnosis and shifting to interventional treatment in case of breakthrough infections and new scar formation needs to be challenged, because the treatment should be tailored to different risk groups.4Surgical correction should be considered in patients with persistent high-grade reflux (grades IV/V). There is no consensus about the timing and type of surgical correction. The outcome of reimplantation is better than endoscopic correction for higher grades of reflux, whereas satisfactory results can be achieved by endoscopic injection for lower grades.3The choice of management depends on the presence of renal scars, clinical course, grade of reflux, ipsilateral renal function, bilaterality, bladder function, associated anomalies of the urinary tract, age, compliance, and parental preference. Febrile UTI, high-grade reflux, bilaterality, and cortical abnormalities are considered to be risk factors for possible renal damage. The presence of LUTD is an additional risk factor for new scars.4 RecommendationsStrength ratingOffer reimplantation or endoscopic correction to patients with frequent breakthrough infections.WeakOffer reimplantation to patients with persistent high-grade reflux and endoscopic correction for lower grades of reflux.StrongOffer surgical repair to children above the age of one presenting with high-grade reflux and abnormal renal parenchyma.WeakOffer surgical correction, if parents prefer definitive therapy to conservative management.StrongSelect the most appropriate management option based on:the presence of renal scars;clinical course;the grade of reflux;ipsilateral renal function;bilaterality;bladder function;associated anomalies of the urinary tract;age and gender;compliance;parental preference.Refer to Table 3 for risk factors and follow-up.WeakIn high-risk patients who already have renal impairment, a more aggressive, multi-disciplinary approach is needed.Strong Table 3: Management and follow-up according to different risk groups Risk GroupsPresentationInitial treatmentCommentFollow-upHighSymptomatic male or female patients after toilet-training with high-grade reflux (grades IV-V), abnormal kidneys and LUTDInitial treatment is always for LUTD with CAP; intervention may be considered in cases of BT infections or persistent refluxGreater possibility of earlier interventionMore aggressive follow-up for UTI and LUTD; full re-evaluation after 6 monthsHighSymptomatic male or female patients after toilet-training with high-grade reflux (grade IV-V), abnormal kidneys and no LUTDIntervention should be consideredReimplantation has better results than endoscopic surgeryPost-operative VCUG on indication only; follow-up of kidney status until after pubertyModerateSymptomatic male or female patients before toilet-training, with high-grade reflux and abnormal kidneysCAP is the initial treatment.
