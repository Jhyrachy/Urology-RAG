7.4. Centralisation of penile cancer services. Current large volume centres offer specialist nursing support, psychological support and specialised lymphoedema services to their patients. However, even in centralised healthcare systems, such as the UK, services vary and are not always available. Centralisation of penile cancer services has a number of advantages in addition to delivering these important supportive services to patients (Table 7.2) [348]. These include provision of an environment where multi-disciplinary discussion of cases can occur along with specialist pathological review, and delivery of high volume penile-preserving and nodal surgery which can lead to innovation, such as closer surgical margins [151], more accurate DSNB and minimally-invasive surgery. In the UK, around 80% of penile cancers are treated with penile-preserving surgery. Centralisation can also reduce system delays [349] and result in better adherence to guidelines. In addition, patients should be able to access a larger team of specialists, including psychological and lymphoedema survivorship services. Centralisation of penile cancer services also creates opportunities for research and running clinical trials with a larger number of patients in a rare disease. Disadvantages of centralisation include de-skilling of medical teams not involved with regularly looking after penile cancer and making patients travel long distances for treatment. This can be a significant financial burden, especially as many are in a lower socio-economic group. However, the recent increase in virtual healthcare and video consultation may reduce this burden, as does the provision of outreach clinics and services. In addition, educational sessions within cancer networks, can help keep local teams up-to-date, enabling them to help support the patient when back at home (Table 7.2). In one hospital in the UK, 5-year CSS rates were observed to improve by up to 12% to 85% following centralisation, which is likely to be due to several factors, including the impact of early and complete pathological LN staging, regular multi-disciplinary patient reviews and use of adjuvant chemotherapy and chemo-radiotherapy in most patients where indicated [350].
