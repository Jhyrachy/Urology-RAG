however, subsequent meta-analyses reported favourable short-term efficacy (qmax ipss) holep . meta-analyses reported similar efficacy 24-months terms ipss, qmax . three meta-analyses evaluating holep vs. b-turp showed significant differences short-term efficacy (ipss, qol score qmax) . one rct comparing holep b-turp patients prostate volume < 80 ml reported significant difference ipss, qol score qmax 24-months . one rct comparing holep m-turp small number patients mean prostate volume < 80 ml seven year follow-up found functional long-term results comparable . another rct comparing holep b-turp patients prostate volume > 80 ml reported significant difference ipss, qol score qmax 36 months, however, overall re-treatment rate significantly lower following holep less patients restarting Î±-blockers less re-operations . comparative efficacy data holep vs. op presented section 5.3.2.1. one rct evaluating holep vs. pkep patients mean prostate volume < 80 ml reported similar improvements ipss qmax twelve months follow-up . another rct comparing holep pkep improvements ipss, qol, pvr, qmax stable 3-year follow-up without differences groups . rct comparing holep vs. bipolar transurethral enucleation reported significant difference ipss, qol score, pvr, qmax one, three-, twelve-months follow-up . sr meta-analysis based retrospective series, revealed superior enucleation efficiency associated en-bloc two-lobe techniques compared three-lobe technique, superiority functional outcomes reported . tolerability safety: several meta-analyses found holep longer operation times, shorter catheterisation hospitalisation times, reduced blood loss, fewer blood transfusions significant differences urethral strictures (2.6% vs. 4.4%) stress urinary incontinence (sui) (1.5% vs. 1.5%) rates compared m-turp . another meta-analysis reported holep shorter catheterisation times, fewer blood transfusions, urethral strictures utis significant differences clot retention rates aur catheter removal compared m-turp . three meta-analyses evaluated holep vs. b-turp . one, reported longer operation times holep, significant differences hospitalisation time complication rates whilst another reported significant differences operation catheterisation times short-term complication rates . data large national database peri-operative outcomes 2,869 laser enucleation prostate 37,577 turp procedures supports laser enucleation prostate associated longer operation times, shorter hospitalisation times, similar complication rates (including transfusions, re-operations), lower rates infectious complications . sr reported holep lower aur rates catheter removal similar haemoglobin drop, uti, urethral stricture, ui rates . rct comparing holep b-turp patients prostate volume < 80 ml reported longer operation time, shorter catheterisation hospitalisation times lower risk haemorrhage holep significant differences blood transfusion rates complication rates 24 months . another rct comparing holep b-turp patients prostate volume > 80 ml reported shorter operation, catheterisation hospitalisation times lower blood transfusion rates holep differences complication rates including ui iief-5 score 36 months comparative data safety holep vs. op presented section 5.3.2.1. one rct evaluating holep vs. pkep patients mean prostate volume < 80 ml reported significantly shorter operation times holep, similar catheterisation hospitalisation times complication rates twelve months follow-up . another rct comparing holep pkep found higher haemoglobin drop prolonged haematuria pkep group clinical significant blood loss either arm occurred . rct comparing holep vs. bipolar b-tuep demonstrated shorter operation hospitalisation times earlier catheter removal holep . another rct comparing high (2j, 50 hz) medium power (2j, 30 hz) holep demonstrated comparable peri-operative safety long-term durability . double-blind rct pulse modulation use holep (virtual basket) demonstrated statistically significantly outcomes related haemostasis (18 vs. 29 min, p < 0.01) operation time (101 vs. 126 min, p < 0.01), compared conventional holep . confirmed sr meta-analysis seven studies comparing pulse modulation use standard holep. shorter enucleation, better haemostasis shorter total surgical time found pulse modulating holep . one rct evaluating tranexamic acid use holep surgery find difference regard bleeding complications peri-operative safety . holmium laser enucleation prostate safely performed patients using anticoagulant and/or antiplatelet medications. however, current limitations include: lack rcts; limited data short- mid-term complications bridging therapy; data presentation allow separate interpretation either antiplatelet anticoagulant therapy . meta-analysis seven rcts evaluating holep vs. turp reported short- mid-term iief-5 scores comparable, whilst long-term scores significantly better holep . two meta-analyses detected difference mid-term retrograde ejaculation rates . impact erectile function comparable however conclusion retrograde ejaculation also comparable holep turp highly dependent use template . erectile function decrease baseline either group;
