5.7. Potential application of urinary cytology and markers. The following objectives of urinary cytology or molecular tests must be considered. 5.7.1. Screening of the population at risk of bladder cancer The application of haematuria dipstick, followed by FGFR3, or UroVysionTM tests if dipstick is positive has been reported in BC screening in high-risk populations [132,133]. However, the low incidence of BC in the general population and the short lead-time impair feasibility and cost-effectiveness of BC screening [127,133]. Thus, routine screening for BC is not recommended [127,132,133]. 5.7.2. Investigation of patients after haematuria or other symptoms suggestive of bladder cancer(primary detection) It is generally accepted that none of the currently available tests can replace cystoscopy. However, urinary cytology or biomarkers can be used as an adjunct to cystoscopy to detect missed tumours, particularly CIS. In this setting, specificity is particularly important. Recently, CellDetect® and UroVysion™ have shown similar performance to detect BC and were both superior to cytology [134]. In addition, Xpert Bladder® had higher sensitivity and negative-predictive value than both cytology or UroVysion™ for the detection of BC in patients with haematuria [121]. 5.7.3. Follow-up of non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer The current status of urine cytology and urinary molecular marker tests in follow-up for non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer is discussed in Section 8.
