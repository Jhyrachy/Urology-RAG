4.1. Definition of non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer. Urothelial tumours confined to the mucosa and invading the lamina propria are classified as stage Ta and T1, respectively, according to the Tumour, Node, Metastasis (TNM) classification system [48]. Intra-epithelial, high-grade (HG) tumours confined to the mucosa are classified as CIS (Tis). All of these tumours can be treated by transurethral resection of the bladder (TURB), eventually in combination with intravesical instillations and are therefore grouped under the heading of NMIBC for therapeutic purposes. The term ‘Non-muscle-invasive BC’ represents a group definition and all tumours should be characterised according to their stage, grade, and further pathological characteristics (see Sections 4.5 and 4.7 and the International Collaboration on Cancer Reporting website: http://www.iccr-cancer.org/datasets/published-datasets/urinary-male-genital/bladder. The term ‘superficial BC’ should no longer be used as it is incorrect.
