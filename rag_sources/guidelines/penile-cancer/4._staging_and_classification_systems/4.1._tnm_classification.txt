4.1. tnm classification. 8th edition uicc/ajcc tnm currently used classification system penile cancer last updated 2017 compared previous (7th) edition, changes introduced. t1 category stratified two different risk groups depending absence presence lymphovascular invasion, perineural invasion, poor differentiation (t1a vs. t1b, respectively, see table 4.1) . furthermore, invasion urethra previously classified t3 disease. however, tumour near meatus may directly invade distal urethra corpus spongiosum, associated worse outcome. addition, previous studies shown corpus spongiosum invasion associated lower incidence inguinal ln metastasis better survival compared corpus cavernosum invasion. therefore, invasion corpus spongiosum corpus cavernosum classified t2 t3, respectively . patients t4 tumours extension adjacent tissues (e.g., prepubic fat, scrotum, spermatic cord, pubic bone, prostate). pn1 category modified include two unilateral inguinal ln metastases, pn2 category modified three unilateral, bilateral ln metastases. based data showing poor outcomes cases involving three unilateral bilateral lns compared involving one two unilateral lns . pn3 stage defined pelvic nodes (uni- bilateral) presence extranodal extension (ene) (inguinal pelvic, regardless number ln metastases) . retroperitoneal ln spread cranial pelvic template classified extra-regional therefore distant metastases. table 4.1: uicc/ajcc 8th edition tnm clinical pathological classification penile cancer clinical classificationt - primary tumourtxprimary tumour cannot assessedt0no evidence primary tumourtiscarcinoma situ (penile intraepithelial neoplasia â€“ pein)tanon-invasive verrucous carcinoma*t1tumour invades subepithelial connective tissuet1atumour invades subepithelial connective tissue without lymphovascular invasion perineural invasion poorly differentiatedt1btumour invades subepithelial connective tissue lymphovascular invasion perineural invasion poorly differentiatedt2tumour invades corpus spongiosum without invasion urethrat3tumour invades corpus cavernosum without invasion urethrat4tumour invades adjacent structuresn - regional lymph nodescnxregional lymph nodes cannot assessedcn0no palpable visibly enlarged inguinal lymph nodescn1palpable mobile unilateral inguinal lymph nodecn2palpable mobile multiple bilateral inguinal lymph nodescn3fixed inguinal nodal mass pelvic lymphadenopathy, unilateral bilateralm - distant metastasiscm0no distant metastasiscm1distant metastasispathological classificationthe pt categories correspond clinical categories.the pn categories based upon biopsy surgical excisionpn - regional lymph nodespnxregional lymph nodes cannot assessedpn0no regional lymph node metastasispn1metastasis one two inguinal lymph nodespn2metastasis two unilateral inguinal nodes bilateral inguinal lymph nodespn3metastasis pelvic lymph node(s), unilateral bilateral extranodal extension regional lymph node metastasispm - distant metastasispm1distant metastasis microscopically confirmedg - histopathological gradinggxgrade differentiation cannot assessedg1well differentiatedg2moderately differentiatedg3g4poorly differentiatedundifferentiated *including verrucous carcinoma.
