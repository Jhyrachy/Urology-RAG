6.2.2.1. Introduction. The goal of RP by any approach is the eradication of cancer while, whenever possible, preserving pelvic organ function [531]. The procedure involves removing the entire prostate with its capsule intact and SVs, followed by vesico-urethral anastomosis. Surgical approaches have expanded from perineal and retropubic open approaches to laparoscopic and robotic-assisted techniques; anastomoses have evolved from Vest approximation sutures to continuous suture watertight anastomoses under direct vision and mapping of the anatomy of the dorsal venous complex (DVC) and cavernous nerves has led to excellent visualisation and potential for preservation of erectile function [532]. The main results from multi-centre RCTs involving RP are summarised in Table 6.1.3.
