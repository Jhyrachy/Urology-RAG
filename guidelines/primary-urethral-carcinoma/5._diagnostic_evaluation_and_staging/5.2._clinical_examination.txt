5.2. Clinical examination. In men, physical examination should comprise palpation of the external genitalia for suspicious indurations or masses and digital rectal examination [36]. In women, further pelvic examination and palpation of the urethra should be performed. In addition, bimanual examination, when necessary under general anaesthesia, should be performed for local clinical staging and to assess whether colorectal or gynaecological malignancies are present. Bilateral inguinal palpation should be done to assess the presence of enlarged LNs, describing location, size, and mobility [37].
