4.1.4.2.5. Placebo and nocebo. Placebo has a clear effect on the improvement of OAB signs and symptoms, and the overall placebo responses in various outcomes studied are statistically significant and, for some of the outcomes, possibly clinically significant. A recent SR including 57 studies with 12,901 patients showed a standardised mean difference of -0.45 for daily micturition episodes, -0.33 for daily nocturia episodes, -0.46 for UUI episodes, -0.50 for daily urgency episodes, -0.51 for daily incontinence episodes, and 0.25 for volume voided per micturition [239]. The same group published a SR with meta-analysis of data retrieved from 57 RCTs on the nocebo effect of pharmacotherapy in patients with OAB (up to 80% females). They reported dry mouth as the most common reported adverse event with mean rate of 4.9%, followed by constipation 2.6%. The authors concluded that HCPs should appreciate the possible positive and negative patient expectation regarding pharmacotherapy for OAB in order to optimise the individual outcomes [240]. The placebo response seems to be non-negligible in OAB, supporting the requirement for placebo control in RCTs.
