7.7.7. Treatment of patients with bone metastases. The prevalence of metastatic bone disease (MBD) in patients with advanced/metastatic UC is 30–40% [544]. Interestingly, a recent report described several observations related to age- and sex-related differences in the distribution of metastases in patients with metastatic BC and demonstrated that bone was the most common metastatic site in men with other differences noted according to patient age and sex [545]. Skeletal complications due to MBD have a detrimental effect on pain and QoL and are also associated with increased mortality [546]. Bisphosphonates such as zoledronic acid reduce and delay skeletal-related events (SREs) due to bone metastases by inhibiting bone resorption, as shown in a small pilot study [547]. Denosumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to and neutralises RANKL (receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand), was shown to be non-inferior to zoledronic acid in preventing or delaying SREs in patients with solid tumours and advanced MBD, including patients with UC [548]. Patients with MBD, irrespective of the cancer type, should be considered for bone-targeted treatment [546]. Patients treated with zoledronic acid or denosumab should be informed about possible side effects including osteonecrosis of the jaw and hypocalcaemia. Supplementation with calcium and vitamin D is mandatory. Dosing regimens of zoledronic acid should follow regulatory recommendations and have to be adjusted according to pre-existing medical conditions, especially renal function [549]. For denosumab, no dose adjustments are required for variations in renal function.
