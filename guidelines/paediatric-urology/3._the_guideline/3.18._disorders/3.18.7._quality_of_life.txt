3.18.7. Quality of life. In general, adult patients with DSD report good quality of life and physical health, however there is an increased risk for both somatic and psychiatric morbidities [1282]. Furthermore, a lower quality of life was reported in the domain “social relationships”, which relates to personal relationships and sexual health [1283,1284]. In addition, patients with DSD report higher levels of psychological distress and mental health problems [1285,1286]. These elements should be included in the multi-disciplinary and holistic health care for these patients. A person’s experienced gender is a fundamental aspect of one’s sense of self. Gender incongruence can occur when there is incongruence between the physical and experienced gender, and if this causes significant distress it furfills the criteria for the diagnosis gender dysphoria, according to the “Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5)” of the American Psychiatric Association [1287]. Gender dysphoria is reported low in women with CAH, CAIS and complete gonadal dysgenesis favoring female sex of rearing. Gender dysphoria is reported high in females with 5-a reductase deficiency and 17β-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-3 deficiency. Gender dysphoria is reported variable in PAIS or mixed gonadal dysgenesis [1288]. Approximately 3% of DSD patients undergo a gender change after puberty, which is a small group, but larger when compared to the general population [1289,1290].
