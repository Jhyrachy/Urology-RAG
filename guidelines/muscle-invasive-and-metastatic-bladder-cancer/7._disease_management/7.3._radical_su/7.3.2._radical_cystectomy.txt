7.3.2. Radical cystectomy: indications. Radical cystectomy is recommended in patients with T2â€“T4a, N0M0 disease, very high-risk NMIBC, BCG- refractory, BCG-relapsing and BCG-unresponsive NMIBC (see EAU Guidelines on Non-muscle-invasive Bladder Cancer [2]), as well as extensive papillary disease that cannot be controlled with TURBT and intravesical chemotherapy/immunotherapy alone. Salvage cystectomy is indicated in non-responders to conservative therapy, i.e., recurrence after bladder-sparing treatment. It is also used as a purely palliative intervention, including for fistula formation, pain and recurrent uncontrollable haematuria (see Section 7.4.1 - Palliative cystectomy).
