5.6.1. Patient education. Educational intervention is often the first approach to sexual complaints, and consists of informing patients about the psychological and physiological processes involved in the individual’s sexual response, in ways the patient can understand. This baseline approach has been shown to favour sexual satisfaction in men with ED [341]. Accordingly, consultation with the patient should include a discussion of the expectations and needs of the patient’s and his sexual partner. It should also review the patient’s and partner’s understanding of ED and the results of diagnostic tests, and provide a rationale for treatment selection [339].
