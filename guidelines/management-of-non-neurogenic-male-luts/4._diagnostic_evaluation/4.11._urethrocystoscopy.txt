4.11. Urethrocystoscopy. Patients with a history of microscopic or gross haematuria, urethral stricture, or bladder cancer, who present with LUTS, should undergo urethrocystoscopy during diagnostic evaluation. The evaluation of a prostatic middle lobe with urethrocystoscopy should be performed when considering interventional treatments for which the presence of middle lobe may affect the treatment offered e.g., Urolift. A prospective study evaluated 122 patients with LUTS using uroflowmetry and urethrocystoscopy [99]. The pre-operative Qmax was normal in 25% of 60 patients who had no bladder trabeculation, 21% of 73 patients with mild trabeculation and 12% of 40 patients with marked trabeculation on cystoscopy. All 21 patients who presented with diverticula had a reduced Qmax. Another study showed that there was no significant correlation between the degree of bladder trabeculation (graded from I to IV), and the pre-operative Qmax value in 39 symptomatic men aged 53-83 years [100]. The largest study published on this issue examined the relation of urethroscopic findings to urodynamic studies in 492 elderly men with LUTS [101]. The authors noted a correlation between cystoscopic appearance (grade of bladder trabeculation and urethral occlusion) and urodynamic indices, DO and low compliance. It should be noted, however, that BOO was present in 15% of patients with normal cystoscopic findings, while 8% of patients had no obstruction, even in the presence of severe trabeculation [101]. Summary of evidenceLEPatients with a history of microscopic or gross haematuria, urethral stricture, or bladder cancer, who present with LUTS, should undergo urethrocystoscopy during diagnostic evaluation.3No study clearly identified a strong association between the urethrocystoscopic and urodynamic findings.3 RecommendationStrength ratingPerform urethrocystoscopy in men with LUTS prior to minimally invasive/surgical therapies if the findings may change treatment.Weak
