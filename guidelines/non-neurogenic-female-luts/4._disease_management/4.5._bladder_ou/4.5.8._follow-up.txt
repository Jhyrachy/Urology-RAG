4.5.8. Follow-up. Women with BOO should be followed up and monitored regularly due to the risk of further deterioration of voiding or renal function in case of persistence and progression of the obstruction. For those who received treatment, monitoring must be done for recurrence of BOO. In particular, women who undergo urethral dilation, urethrotomy or urethroplasty for urethral stricture need to be monitored for stricture recurrence.
