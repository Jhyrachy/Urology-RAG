3.16.2.3. Interventions for urinary stone treatment. 3.16.2.3.1. Extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy For patients without bacteriuria undergoing ESWL two systematic reviews and meta-analyses were identified with latest search dates of November 2011 and October 2012, respectively [535,536] and two further trials [537]. Lu et al., included nine RCTs with a total of 1,364 patients and found no evidence of benefit in terms of reducing the rate of post-procedural fever or bacteriuria [535]. Mrkobrada et al., included eight RCTs with a total of 940 participants and found no evidence of benefit for antibiotic prophylaxis to reduce rate of fever or trial-defined infection [536]. A RCT with 274 patients and severe risk of bias found no reduction in fever at up to one week post-procedure using a single dose of levofloxacin 500 mg and no difference in the rate of bacteriuria [537]. Another RCT (n=600) again with severe risk of bias found no difference in UTI and positive urine culture rates at two weeks post-procedure using 200 mg ofloxacin post-operatively for 3-days vs. placebo [538]. For patients with bacteriuria or deemed at high risk of complications one RCT comparing the use of ofloxacin or trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole for three days prior and four days subsequent to ESWL in 56 patients with ureteric stents was identified [539]. They found no difference in rate of clinical UTI at seven days (no events) and no difference in post-ESWL bacteriuria. 3.16.2.3.2. Ureteroscopy One updated systematic review and meta-analysis with last search date of June 2017 was identified and included eleven RCTs with 4,591 patients [540]. The meta-analysis found that post-operative pyuria and bacteriuria rates were significantly lower in patients who received pre-operative antibiotic prophylaxis pyuria (OR: 0.42, 95% CI 0.25–0.69 and OR: 0.25, 95% CI 0.11–0.58, respectively). Five studies assessed post-operative febrile UTI (fUTI) and found no difference in the rate of fUTIs between patients who did or did not receive antibiotic prophylaxis (OR: 0.82, 95% CI 0.40– 1.67; p=0.59). However, a significantly higher risk of post-operative fever in the pre-operative antibiotic prophylaxis group (OR: 1.75, 95% CI 1.22–2.50; p=0.002) was reported. A subgroup analysis on the type of pre-operative antibiotic prophylaxis found no difference between a single dose of oral vs. intravenous antibiotics [540]. A RCT comparing different ciprofloxacin-based antibiotic prophylaxis regimens on the incidence of SIRS after URS found there was no difference in the incidences of SIRS between the regimens including the zero-dose regime [541]. However, there was a greater risk of SIRS in patients who did not receive antibiotic prophylaxis when the stone size was > 200 mm2 [541]. Another RCT comparing the use of two oral doses of 3g Fosfomycin tromethamine before surgery to standard of care did not find any difference in the incidence of infections, bacteriuria or fever [542]. Panel discussion considered that despite low quality evidence suggesting no benefit in reducing risk of clinical UTI, clinicians and patients would prefer to use prophylaxis to prevent kidney infection or sepsis. Ideally this should be examined in a robustly designed clinical study. 3.16.2.3.3. Percutaneous neprolithotomy (PNL) The largest systematic review and meta-analysis performed, latest search date April 2019, included 1,549 patients in thirteen comparative studies on antibiotic prophylaxis strategies for PNL [543]. Compared with a single dose before surgery pre-operative antibiotic prophylaxis significantly reduced post-operative sepsis and fever (OR 0.31, 95%CI 0.20-0.50 and OR 0.26, 95%CI 0.14-0.48, respectively) [543]. Similarly, the rate of positive pelvic urine and positive stones culture were reduced when pre-operative prophylaxis was given. There was no difference in sepsis rates between patients receiving or not receiving post-operative prophylaxis; however, patients who received post-operative antibiotic prophylaxis had more fever [543]. Four RCTs with overall low risk of bias comparing different antibiotic regimes in PNL were identified [544-547]. Seyrek et al., compared the rate of SIRS following PNL in 191 patients receiving either a combination of sulbactam/ampicillin or cefuroxime. There was no difference in SIRS or urosepsis rates [544]. Tuzel et al., investigated single dose ceftriaxone versus ceftriaxone and subsequently an oral third-generation cephalosporin until after nephrostomy catheter withdrawal at mean (SD) of 3 (1) days in 73 participants undergoing PNL. They found no difference in rate of infectious complications between the two antibiotic regimens [545]. Taken et al., compared the administration of 1g ceftriaxone and 1g cefazoline both administered 30 minutes before surgery and continued till nephrostomy removal. They found no difference in terms of SRIS or sepsis between groups [547]. Omar et al., compared ciprofloxacin 200 mg IV vs. 2 mg cefotaxime 30 minutes before and 12hours after surgery and found a higher rate of fever in the cefotaxime group [546]. However, these results remain limited by the high risk of bias and the lack of data regarding post-operative infection. These studies give moderate evidence that a single dose of a suitable agent was adequate for prophylaxis against clinical infection after PNL.
