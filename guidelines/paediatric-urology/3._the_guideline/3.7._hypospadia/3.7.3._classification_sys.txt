3.7.3. Classification systems. Hypospadias are usually classified based on the anatomical location of the proximally displaced urethral orifice: distal-anterior hypospadias (located on the glans or distal shaft of the penis and the most commo type of hypospadias);intermediate-middle (penile);proximal-posterior (penoscrotal, scrotal, perineal). The pathology may be different after skin release and should be reclassified accordingly. Anatomical location of the meatus may not always be enough to explain the severity and the complex nature of this pathology. Therefore, a simple classification related to severity of the problem, which considers penile length, glans size, shape, urethral plate quality and penile curvature is commonly used. In that classification there are two types: mild hypospadias (glanular or penile isolated hypospadias without associated chordee, micropenis or scrotal anomaly); and severe hypospadias (penoscrotal, perineal hypospadias with associated chordee and scrotal anomalies).
