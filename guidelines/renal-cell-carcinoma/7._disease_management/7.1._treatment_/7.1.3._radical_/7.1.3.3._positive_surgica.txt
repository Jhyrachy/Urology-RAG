7.1.3.3. Positive surgical margins on histopathological specimens. A PSM is encountered in about 2-8% of T1 PNs [354]. Studies comparing surgical margins with different surgical approaches (open, laparoscopic, robotic) are inconclusive [355-357]. Most trials showed that intra-operative frozen section analysis had no influence on the risk of definite PSMs [358]. A PSM status occurs more frequently in cases in which surgery is imperative (solitary kidneys and bilateral tumours) and in patients with adverse pathological features (pT2a, pT3a, grade IIIâ€“IV) [359-362]. The majority of retrospective analyses reported so far indicated that PSMs do not translate into a higher risk of metastases or a decreased CSS [360,361]. On the other hand, another retrospective study of a large single-institutional series showed that PSMs are an independent predictor of PFS due to a higher incidence of distant and local relapses [363]. Another retrospective study of 42,114 PN patients with 2,823 PSM patients (6.7%) showed an increased presence of PSM in upstaged pT3a tumours (14.1%), increased all-cause mortality in PSM patients and a decreased 5-year OS rate in pT3a tumours (PSM: 69% vs. NSM: 90.9 %) [364]. However, only a proportion of patients with an uncertain margin status actually harbour residual malignancy. Local tumour bed recurrences were found in 16% in patients with PSMs compared with 3% in those with negative margins [359], Therefore, RN or re-resection of margins can result in over-treatment in many cases. Patients with PSMs should be informed that they will need a more intense surveillance (imaging) follow-up and that they are at increased risk of secondary local therapies [360,365]. On the other hand, protection from recurrence is not ensured by negative surgical margins [366] as it is reported in up to 1.5% of cases in this category of patients [354].
