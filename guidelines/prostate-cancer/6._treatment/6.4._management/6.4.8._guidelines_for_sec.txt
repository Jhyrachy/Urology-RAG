6.4.8. Guidelines for second-line therapy after treatment with curative intent. Local salvage treatmentStrength ratingRecommendations for biochemical recurrence (BCR) after radical prostatectomyOffer early salvage intensity-modulated radiotherapy/volumetric arc radiation therapy plus image-guided radiotherapy to men with two consecutive PSA rises.StrongA negative positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scan should not delay salvage radiotherapy (SRT), if otherwise indicated.StrongOffer monitoring, including prostate-specific antigen (PSA), to EAU Low-Risk BCR patients.WeakDo not wait for a PSA threshold before starting treatment. Once the decision for SRT has been made, SRT (at least 64 Gy) should be given as soon as possible.StrongOffer hormonal therapy in addition to SRT to men with BCR.WeakRecommendations for BCR after radiotherapyOffer monitoring, including PSA to EAU Low-Risk BCR patients.WeakOnly offer salvage radical prostatectomy (RP), brachytherapy, stereotactic body radiotherapy, high-intensity focused ultrasound, or cryosurgical ablation to highly selected patients with biopsy-proven local recurrence within a clinical trial setting or well-designed prospective cohort study undertaken in experienced centres.StrongRecommendations for systemic salvage treatmentDo not offer androgen deprivation therapy to M0 patients with a PSA-doubling time > twelve months.StrongOffer enzalutamide with or without androgen deprivation therapy to M0 patients with high-risk BCR, defined as a PSA doubling time of ≤9 months and a PSA level of ≥2ng/ml above nadir after radiation therapy or ≥1 ng/ml after radical prostatectomy with or without postoperative radiation therapy.StrongRecommendations for follow-up after radical prostatectomy or radiotherapyRoutinely follow-up asymptomatic patients by obtaining at least a disease-specific history and serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) measurement.StrongAt recurrence, only perform imaging if the result will affect treatment planning.Strong
