4.5.7.3. Pelvic organ prolapse surgery. Pelvic organ prolapse surgery may relieve BOO by correcting the urethral kinking caused by the prolapse or by relieving the urethral compression brought about by the prolapsing organ [74,509,529]. Bladder outlet obstruction due to POP may be addressed by corrective surgery. Based on reviews, the majority of patients who had BOO caused by POP who had repair of their cystocoele demonstrated improvement of their voiding difficulties [462,558]. A multicentre prospective study involving 277 women with at least grade two symptomatic POP who underwent surgery demonstrated a significant reduction in voiding symptoms and PVR volume one year postoperatively [559]. A retrospective study of 50 women who underwent laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy for POP showed a significant increase in mean postoperative Qmax and decrease in PdetQmax and PVR in those aged > 65 years. The OAB symptom score improved but there was no significant difference in the ICIQ-SF score postoperatively [560].
