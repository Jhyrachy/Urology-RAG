5.1. patient history. purpose history taking assess symptoms including severity duration, possible aetiology, prior treatments, complications, associated problems, patient factors may impact upon surgical outcome. clinical presentation urethral stricture disease varied. retrospective analysis 611 patients endoscopically confirmed diagnosis urethral stricture, luts common presentation (54.3%) followed acute urinary retention (22.3%), urinary tract infection (uti) (6.1%) difficult catheterisation (4.8%) . retrospective study 214 patients underwent anterior urethroplasty, weak stream reported common individual luts (49%) followed incomplete emptying (27%) urinary frequency (20%) . retrospective series 614 patients undergoing anterior urethroplasty found post-void dribble present 73% . genitourinary pain common feature, affecting 22.9-71% . pain may felt bladder and/or urethra, associated severe luts, likely felt younger men resolves following reconstruction . complaints include spraying (9%), visible haematuria (3.1-5%), urethral abscess/necrotising fasciitis (2.3%), urgency (14%) incontinence (1-4%) . establish aetiology, enquiry history pelvic, genital, perineal trauma, prior instrumentation, prior surgeries, irradiation focal therapies urethritis made. important document prior surgical approaches date recent intervention (e.g., dilatation) may impact upon timing radiological evaluation surgical treatment. problems sexual function common patients urethral stricture disease sexual function may impacted upon surgical intervention ; therefore, status erectile ejaculatory function established documented using validated tools. performance status patient determined may influence choice treatment (curative palliative). past medical history assess factors may impact upon tissue healing including diabetes, immunosuppression, smoking. oral tobacco use chewing betel leaves may increase risk morbidity harvest site render oral mucosa poor use. prior harvest oral mucosa noted alternative sources tissue transfer may need considered alternative surgical approaches (e.g., perineal urethrostomy [pu]).
