6.4.3. Bladder stone interventions. Minimally invasive techniques for the removal of bladder stones have been widely adopted to reduce the risk of complications and shorten hospital stay and convalescence. Bladder stones can be treated with open, laparoscopic, robotic-assisted laparoscopic, endoscopic (transurethral or percutaneous) surgery or ESWL [736]. 6.4.3.1. Suprapubic cystolithotomy Open suprapubic cystolithotomy is very effective but is associated with a need for catheterisation and longer hospital stay in both adults and children compared to all other stone removal modalities [736]. In children, a non-randomised study found that, if the bladder was closed meticulously in two layers, “tubeless” (drain-less and catheter-less) cystolithotomy was associated with a significantly shorter length of hospital stay compared with traditional cystolithotomy, without significant differences regarding late or intra-operative complications provided that children with prior UTI, recurrent stones, or with previous surgery for anorectal malformation (or other relevant surgery) were excluded [737]. 6.4.3.2. Transurethral cystolithotripsy In both adults and children, transurethral cystolithotripsy provides high SFRs and appears to be safe, with a very low risk of unplanned procedures and major post-operative and late complications [736]. 6.4.3.2.1. Transurethral cystolithotripsy in adults In adults, a meta-analysis of four RCTs including 409 patients demonstrated that transurethral cystolithotripsy has a shorter hospital stay and convalescence with less pain, but equivalent SFR and complications compared to percutaneous cystolithotripsy [736]. Transurethral cystolithotripsy with a nephroscope was quicker than percutaneous cystolithotripsy in three RCTs, although transurethral cystolithotripsy with a cystoscope was slower than percutaneous cystolithotripsy [736]. Rates of urethral strictures following transurethral procedures were not robustly reported: studies report rates between 2.9% and 19.6% during a follow up period of 12 – 24 months [720,736,738]. One small RCT demonstrated a shorter duration of catheterisation, hospital stay and procedure with transurethral cystolithotripsy than open cystolithotomy with similar SFR [736]. Meta-analysis of five RCTs found significantly shorter procedure duration for transurethral cystolithotripsy using a nephroscope vs. cystoscope with similar SFRs, hospital stay, convalescence, pain, and complications [739]. Two retrospective studies (n=188) reported that using a resectoscope or nephroscope was associated with a shorter procedure duration (p < 0.05) than a cystoscope for transurethral cystolithotripsy [740,741]. This suggests that transurethral cystolithotripsy is quicker when using a continuous flow instrument. 6.4.3.2.1.1. Lithotripsy modalities used during transurethral cystolithotripsy in adults. When considering lithotripsy modalities for transurethral cystolithotripsy, the Panel’s systematic review found very low-quality evidence from five non-randomised studies (n=385) which found no difference in SFR between modalities (mechanical, laser, pneumatic, ultrasonic, electrohydraulic lithotripsy [EHL] or washout alone) [736]. Unplanned procedures and major postoperative complications were low-rate events and were not significantly different between lithotripsy modalities, although one non-randomised study (NRS) suggested these might be higher with EHL or mechanical lithotripsy than pneumatic or ultrasonic lithotripsy [742]. All outcomes had very low-quality evidence (GRADE) [736]. High-powered lasers seem to reduce lithotripsy time. Laser lithotripsy was faster than pneumatic lithotripsy (MD 16.6 minutes; CI: 23.51-9.69, p < 0.0001) in one NRS (n=62); however, a laser was used with a resectoscope and the pneumatic device with a cystoscope [743]. The same conclusion was stated in a meta-analysis of ten RCTs with high heterogeneity and small sample sizes in some of the included RCTs [744]. Continuous vs. intermittent irrigating instruments may affect the operation time more significantly than the choice of lithotripsy device [736]. 6.4.3.2.1.2. Transurethral cystolithotripsy in children In children, three NRS suggest that transurethral cystolithotripsy has a shorter hospital stay and catheterisation time than open cystolithotomy, but similar stone-free and complication rates [745]. One small quasi-RCT found a shorter procedure time using laser vs. pneumatic lithotripsy for < 1.5 cm bladder stones with no difference in SFR or other outcomes [746]. Another RCT (n=73) found shorter procedure time using pneumatic vs. laser therapy for bladder stones ≤ 1.5 cm with similar SFRs and higher (minor) complication rates for pneumatic lithotripsy [747]. 6.4.3.3. Percutaneous cystolithotripsy 6.4.3.3.1. Percutaneous cystolithotripsy in adults: One NRS found a shorter duration of procedure and catheterisation and less blood loss for percutaneous, compared with open surgery in adult male patients with urethral strictures; all patients in both groups were rendered stone-free [722]. Meta-analysis of four RCTs comparing transurethral and percutaneous cystolithotripsy found a shorter hospital stay for transurethral cystolithotripsy over percutaneous surgery. Transurethral cystolithotripsy was quicker when using a nephroscope. There were no significant differences in SFRs, major postoperative complications, or re-treatment [736]. 6.4.3.3.2. Percutaneous cystolithotripsy in children: In children, three NRS suggest that percutaneous cystolithotripsy has a shorter hospital stay and catheterisation time, but a longer procedure duration and more peri-operative complications than open cystolithotripsy; SFRs were similar [726,736,745,748]. A systematic review identified four non-randomised studies comparing percutaneous and transurethral cystolithotripsy and found similar SFRs, but that transurethral surgery offers shorter duration of catheterisation and hospital stay [726,745] in contrast, a transurethral approach may need a longer operative time and shows a higher post-operative stricture rate [748]. One small NRS found a non-significant increased risk of unplanned procedures (within 30 days of primary procedure) and major postoperative complications for percutaneous operations compared with transurethral procedures; however, age and stone size determined which intervention children underwent and all patients were rendered stone-free [726]. One RCT compared 48 boys < 14 years undergoing transurethral lithotripsy vs. 49 boys undergoing percutaneous lithotripsy with comparable success and complication rates; however, PCCL had a shorter operative time and less need for stone disintegration [749]. 6.4.3.4. Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy Extracorporeal SWL is the least invasive therapeutic procedure [736]. 6.4.3.4.1. Shock wave lithotripsy in adults In adults, one RCT compared SWL with transurethral cystolithotripsy in 100 patients with ≤ 2 cm bladder stones presenting with acute urinary retention. Stone-free rate after one SWL session favoured transurethral cystolithotripsy (86% vs. 98%, p = 0.03); however, following up to three sessions of SWL, there was no significant difference in SFR (94% vs. 98%, p = 0.3) [736,750]. Two NRS compared transurethral cystolithotripsy vs. SWL and found no significant difference in SFR (97.0% vs. 93.9%, p=0.99, 97.7% vs. 89.7% p=0.07) despite larger stones in transurethral cystolithotripsy patients (4.2 vs. 2.5 cm, p=0.014; and 3.6 vs. 2.6 cm [p value not reported]) [751,752]. Length of hospital stay appeared to favour SWL in all three studies (0 vs. 1 day, 4.8 vs. 0 days, p=0.02, 0.8 vs. 2.4 days, respectively) [750-752]. No significant differences in major post-operative or intra-operative complications were reported in any study [750-752]. One NRS compared SWL vs. open cystolithotomy in just 43 patients. Stone sizes were not comparable (2.5 vs. 7.4 cm, p < 0.001). Stone-free rates were not significantly different (93.9% vs. 100%, p=0.50). Length of stay favored SWL. There was no significant difference in intra-operative or major post-operative complications [751]. 6.4.3.4.2. Shock wave lithotripsy in children One large NRS found lower SFR for SWL than both transurethral cystolithotripsy and open cystolithotomy, despite treating smaller stones with SWL. However, the length of hospital stays favoured SWL over open cystolithotomy, although this appeared to be comparable between SWL and transurethral cystolithotripsy [753]. 6.4.3.5. Laparoscopic cystolithotomy Laparoscopic cystolithotomy has been described in adults and is typically performed in combination with simple prostatectomy using either traditional laparoscopy or with robotic assistance [754,755]. A SR found no studies comparing laparoscopic surgery with other procedures [736].
