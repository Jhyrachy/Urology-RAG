9.3.2.6. Final remarks. The complaint of “short penis” is variable in presentation and aetiology. Some patients demonstrate anatomical and pathological conditions while others do not. A vast array of treatments for different aetiologies of “short penis,” both surgical and non-surgical, have been reviewed. If psychopathological symptoms are detected, the patient must be referred for further medical diagnosis. Treatment for short-penis syndrome requires a multi-disciplinary approach, including medical and ethical considerations, and the majority of reported outcomes are based on a paucity of evidence.
