3.19.3. Diagnostic evaluation. During prenatal US screening, hydroureteronephrosis and a distended bladder are suspicious signs of a urethral valve. A thick-walled bladder seems to better predict PUV than a dilated posterior urethra (‘keyhole’ sign) [1307]. However, differentiation between obstructive and non-obstructive aetiologies on prenatal US is challenging, as both have a similar sonographic appearance [1308]. In the presence of increased echogenicity of the kidney, dilatation of the urinary tract and oligohydramnios, the diagnosis of a PUV should strongly be considered. Prenatal US is adequate in most of the cases (90%) [1309]. However, in some circumstances when technical ultrasound conditions are poor, fetal MRI may provide additional information [1310]. Postnatally, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen and electrolytes should be monitored closely during the first few days. Initial management includes a multi-disciplinary team involving a paediatric nephrologist. The clinician must be aware of a noteworthy association between PUV and undescended testicles (UDT) and/or inguinal hernia [1311]. Undescended testicles occurred in 12–17 % of PUV which is consistent with a 10-fold increase [1312]. A voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) (including lateral views of the urethra during the voiding phase without a catheter in situ) is recommended to assess the presence of a PUV. This study is essential whenever there is a question of an infravesical obstruction, as the urethral anatomy is well outlined during voiding. The extent of posterior urethral deformity – as expressed by the posterior urethral height: width ratio – appears to correlate positively with nadir creatinine at twelve months of age [1313]. Nuclear renography with split renal function is important in assessing contributory renal function and/or scarring (DMSA or MAG3).
