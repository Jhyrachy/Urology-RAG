6.1.2.3. Laser ablation. In line with results achieved in non-invasive and superficially-invasive penile lesions, laser ablation has been proposed as an option for smaller invasive lesions. Typically, a CO2 laser can resect the tumour with ample millimetres of margin, while for coagulation of the tumour bed a Nd:YAG laser is the better option as it provides deeper uniform tissue coagulation. Healing time is fastest after CO2 laser treatment, with re-epithelization almost complete by three to six weeks post-treatment. Because of the greater depth of tissue coagulation, the healing time for Nd:YAG laser treatment is longer, often up to six weeks [134]. Penetration depth depends on laser type and settings and most commonly used settings are 15–20 W for CO2 and 15–25 W for Nd:YAG lasers but only very few publications provide technical details [134]. In the Panel’s SR, seven studies reported outcomes of laser therapy for invasive penile cancer limited to T1 (81.2%) or T2 (18.5%) disease in a total of 389 patients [3]. Five-year RFR ranged from 34.2-94%. The cumulative mean 5-year RFR was 69.4% (270/389). Three studies reported a 5-year RFR per disease stage of 42.9–73.9% for T1 and 23.5%–84.2% for T2 disease. In nine studies (n = 512), the penile preservation rate following laser therapy was 50–100% (mean 89.2%), indicating that a large proportion of recurrences had to be managed with total amputation, which raises caution on the use of such technique and its use is likely best limited to T1 tumours. Tang et al., demonstrated that nodal recurrence was high in a multi-institutional cohort of patients treated with laser ablation as monotherapy, illustrating the importance of pre-ablation biopsy for risk stratification and nodal staging. Clinicians should be aware of the risk of understaging as a result of incision biopsy followed by ablation vs. complete resection [10,154], and it is advised that patients be informed that laser therapy may result in higher local recurrence rates when compared to surgical excision. Three studies reported on laser-related complications, with preputial oedema and dysuria reported most frequently. Meatal stenosis was reported in 7.4% and post-operative bleeding in 1–7% of patients. Three studies assessed the sexual function after laser treatment and 46.0–56.5% of men report an impact on their sexual life. A single trial including 46 men found that 72% reported no change in erectile function, 22% reported decreased erectile function and 6% reported improvement [155].
