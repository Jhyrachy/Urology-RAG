3.4. Pathology. Squamous cell carcinoma accounts for over 95% of penile malignancies. It is not known how often SCC is preceded by premalignant lesions [50-53]. Penile intraepithelial neoplasia is considered the precursor lesion of penile SCC, PeINs are classified into HPV-independent, known as differentiated PeIN, HPV-associated, following the same scheme as the invasive counterparts (see Table 3.2). Clinical terms such as ‘Erythroplasia of Queyrat, Bowenoid papulosis and Bowen’s disease’ are discouraged, based on the 2022 WHO classification [8,54]. Different histological types of penile SCC with different growth patterns, clinical aggressiveness and HPV associations have been identified (see Table 3.1). Numerous mixed forms exist such as the warty-basaloid form, with 50–60% the most common mixed form, the usual-verrucous (hybrid), usual-warty, usual-basaloid and the usual-papillary, as well as other rarer combinations. Other malignant lesions of the penis, all much less common than penile SCC, are melanocytic lesions, mesenchymal tumours, lymphomas, and metastases. Penile metastases are frequently of prostatic, urinary bladder or colorectal origin [55]. Different types of penile sarcoma have been reported [8]. Table 3.2: Classification of penile intra-epithelial neoplasia  HPV-independentoDifferentiated PeINHPV-associated PeINoCommon patterns: basaloid (undifferentiated), warty (condylomatous), and mixedoOther (less frequent) patterns: pagetoid, clear cell, and spindle cell histology 3.4.1. Gross handling of pathology specimens Tissue sections determine the accuracy of histological diagnosis. Small lesions should be fully included, bigger lesions should have at least 3-4 blocks of tumour with the anatomical landmarks. Specimens should be properly oriented by the surgeons and, in case of circumcision or glans resurfacing, properly pinned to allow clear evaluation of the resection margins. Penectomy specimens must be canalised through the urethra and cut longitudinally in two halves for the evaluation of invasion of the penile structures. In larger tumours identification of distal urethra on gross (as also microscopy) may be difficult. Whole-mount inclusion and sections are recommended as they provide a better background for the appropriate identification of anatomical structures that can improve accurate staging, with a minimal increase in cost [56]. Sentinel LN should be evaluated according to a standardised IHC protocol [57] for detection of micro-metastases; lymphadenectomy/lymph node dissection (LND) specimens should be inked, and the LNs evaluated properly since extra-capsular extension profoundly influences nodal staging and treatment decisions. Second-opinion pathology review is highly desirable for this rare tumour entity [58], as is setting up comprehensive referral centres for penile cancer management on a national level [58,59]. 3.4.2. Pathology report For standardisation and data collection purposes the dataset template from the International Collaboration on Cancer Reporting (ICCR) should be used when possible. The pathology report must include the anatomical site of the primary tumour, the histological type of SCC, grade, perineural invasion, depth of invasion, vascular invasion (venous/lymphatic), pattern of invasion, urethral invasion, invasion of corpus spongiosum/corpora cavernosum, surgical margins and p16 IHC results [60-63] (Table 3.3). The confirmation of the presence of HPV in the specimen (e.g., polymerase chain reaction [PCR], in-situ hybridization [ISH] for viral DNA/ribonucleic acid [RNA]) is desirable but currently only carried out in research settings.

Grading The tumour, node, metastasis (TNM) classification for penile cancer includes tumour grade based on its prognostic relevance. Tumour grading in penile cancer has been shown to be highly observer-dependent and can be problematic, especially in large tumours which may be heterogeneous. This may have implications on the clinical management, as there may be discordance between biopsy and resection grading [50]. Inter-observer agreement varies according to the experience and specialisation of the pathologist. In general, inter-observer agreement is poor to moderate (Fleiss’ kappa 0.07–0.55) [69]. Nevertheless, until a new methodology to grade penile SCC is developed, grading based on the WHO/The International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) classification is recommended (see Table 3.4) with grade 3 and sarcomatoid being considered as poorly differentiated.

Pathological prognostic factors Pathological subtype, peri-neural invasion, lymphovascular invasion [67], depth of invasion and grade in the primary tumour are strong predictors of poor prognosis and high cancer-specific mortality [70]. Higher grade and lymphovascular invasion are predictors of metastatic spread. Lymphovascular space involvement/invasion is often seen in advanced stages but may also be seen in early invasive tumours of high grade and some histologic subtypes [71,72]. The extent of LN metastasis and extracapsular spread are also strong predictors of prognosis. Urethral invasion is not considered a prognostic factor (UICC, 8th Edn) [73]. Nevertheless, invasion of the more proximal urethra can signify a highly aggressive SCC with a poor prognosis probably due the invasion of subjacent erectile corpora (see Table 4.1). A SR found that invasion of the corpus spongiosum (pT2) showed better cancer-specific survival (CSS), but no overall survival (OS) benefit compared to invasion of the corpora cavernosa [74]. A modified pT2/T3 has been proposed, taking into consideration high-grade, lymphovascular- and perineural invasion features in response to this inconsistency [75]. Extra-capsular extension in even one single LN carries a poor prognosis and is denoted as pN3 [76-78]. Chaux et al., suggested a prognostic index which incorporates grade, anatomical level of infiltration and perineural invasion to predict the likelihood of inguinal LN metastases and 5-year survival [79]. Sali et al., proposed a histopathological risk scoring incorporating grade, anatomical level of involvement and replaced perineural invasion with pattern of infiltration [66]. Other clinical-, pathological- and radiological scores, as well as nomograms have been described but none of these have been comparatively validated which precludes making a recommendation. 3.4.5. Penile cancer and HPV In the 2022 WHO classification the presence of HPV is a key determinant for the broad classification of penile SCC [8]. However, in most clinical settings, standard molecular assessment of HPV status is not available. p16 IHC is used as a surrogate for high-risk HPV genotype presence and marker of oncogenic activity. In the absence of more advanced techniques, it is helpful in assigning penile SCC to HPV-associated subtypes. The p16 IHC overall positivity in penile cancer was 41.6% [23]. Higher positivity was seen in morphological HPV-associated SCCs (85.8%) as compared with HPV-independent SCCs (17.1%)[23]. Comparing with RNA ISH, p16 IHC showed a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 71%, the latter improved to 89% when considering a high intensity for p16 IHC positivity [80]. These data indicate that sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values for HPV positivity can be improved using the stringent p16 IHC cut-off suggested by Cubilla et al. [81] (Figure 3.2). The ISUP reported that 80% of their respondents during a consultation conference on molecular pathology of urogenital cancers used p16 IHC to separate HPV-associated from HPV-independent PeIN and SCCs and made recommendations on the use of p16 IHC [82]. Fig 3.2: Patterns of p16 expression. (A) no staining; (B) mosaic staining pattern: (C) en-bloc staining pattern. Only (C) is considered positive for p16. 3.4.6. Penile biopsy: pathological and technical considerations The quality of biopsy is important [50]. In most cases, acquiring a punch biopsy (e.g., 2–3 mm) under local anaesthesia is sufficient to confirm the diagnosis. In biopsies with an average size of 1 mm, it was difficult to evaluate the depth of invasion in 91% of cases [50]. Furthermore, vascular and lymphatic tumour emboli were detected in only 9–11% of cases [50]. Therefore, in cases where assessment of depth of invasion is necessary, an incisional biopsy which is deep enough to properly assess the degree of invasion and stage is preferable. 3.4.7. Summary of evidence and guidelines for the pathological assessment of tumour specimens Summary of evidenceLEIncidence of penile cancer varies according to geographical location, race and ethnicity.2aWestern developed countries have seen a slight increase in incidence, which may be caused by higher HPV infection rates.2aIn analogy to other HPV-associated cancers, HPV status may influence DSS of penile cancer, but more data is needed, underlining the importance of routine assessment of HPV status in all penile cancer patients.2b RecommendationsStrength ratingThe pathological evaluation of penile carcinoma specimens must include the pTNM (see Chapter 4) stage and an assessment of tumour grade.StrongThe pathological evaluation of penile carcinoma specimens must include an assessment of p16 by immunohistochemistry.StrongThe pathological evaluation of penile carcinoma specimens should follow the ICCR dataset synoptic report.Strong ICCR = International Collaboration on Cancer Reporting.
