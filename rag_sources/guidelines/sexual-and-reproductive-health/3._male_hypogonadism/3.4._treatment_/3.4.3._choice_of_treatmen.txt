3.4.3. choice treatment. 3.4.3.1. lifestyle factors reported above, functional hypogonadism frequently associated obesity metabolic disorders . therefore, weight loss lifestyle changes first approach overweight obese men hypogonadism. previous meta-analysis documented low-calorie diet revert obesity-associated secondary hypogonadism increasing total testosterone ft, reducing oestrogens restoring normal gonadotropin circulating levels . confirmed updated meta-analysis showing increase testosterone significantly associated weight reduction . similar results obtained physical activity, associated duration scheduled exercise weight loss obtained . however, recognised increase testosterone levels observed low-calorie diet physical activity small (1-2 nmol) . addition, 60-86% weight lost regained three years 75-121% five years . lifestyle changes represent essential part management obesity; however, evidence suggests compared lifestyle modifications alone, testosterone therapy-treated obese men benefit relief symptoms associated testosterone deficiency, whereas treated benefit . limited evidence suggest combination life-style interventions testosterone therapy symptomatic hypogonadal men might result better outcomes . described above, t4dm study demonstrated two-years testosterone therapy lifestyle intervention superior lifestyle intervention alone reducing waist circumference total abdominal fat content. significant reduction body weight compared lifestyle intervention alone . interestingly, recent data also showed weight loss obtained thought use glucagon-like peptide-1 analogues analogues result better testosterone increases compared diet programs alone . 3.4.3.2. medical preparations several testosterone formulations available (table 5). direct comparisons among different testosterone products still lacking. candidates testosterone therapy adequately informed possible risks benefits available testosterone preparations. final choice based clinical situation, testosterone formulation availability, patient needs expectations . 3.4.3.2.1. oral formulations oral formulation available oleic acid since 1970s, recently reformulated mixture castor oil propylene glycol laureate (testosterone undecanoate [tu] caps), allow drug maintained room temperature without degradation . main limitation related poor bioavailability, strongly dependent dietary fat content . us food drug administration (fda) approved new formulation oral tu liquid-filled soft gel capsule, improved oral availability . available evidence showed tu capsule formulations reach steady 24-hour average serum testosterone levels 80% hypogonadal men, thus resulting significant improvement sexual function domains time points compared baseline along excellent safety profile . recently, fda approved new oral formulation contains carriers vitamin e, phytosterol esters, polyoxyl 40 hydrogenated castor oil propylene glycol monolaurate . new oral tu formulations mild increase arterial blood pressure reported. hence, fda required black box warning drugs induce blood pressure increase . mesterolone 5α-dihydrotestosterone (dht) derivate available oral administration. along dht, mesterolone cannot converted oestrogens used limited period specific indications, presence painful gynaecomastia. however, lack full spectrum testosterone bioactivity strongly limits long-term use . 3.4.3.2.2. parenteral formulations injectable testosterone preparations classified according half-lives (table 5). testosterone propionate short-term ester formulation requiring multiple fractionated doses (usually 50-100 mg, every two three days), thus representing major limitation use . cypionate enanthate-t esters short-term formulations, requiring administration every two four weeks. formulation containing mixed testosterone esters (tu, isocaproate, phenyl propionate, propionate) benefit steady release testosterone circulation, available countries. use older formulations associated wide fluctuations plasma testosterone concentrations often reported unpleasant patients potentially resulting adverse effects, polycythaemia . longer-lasting tu injectable formulation widely available , good safety/benefit profile allowing maintenance normal stable testosterone levels dose 1,000 mg initially every twelve weeks, following six-week loading dose, adjusted frequency ten fourteen weeks dependent trough (pre-injection level) three five injections maintain levels therapeutic range (usually > 12 < 18 nmol/l) . 3.4.3.2.3. transdermal testosterone preparations among available transdermal formulations, testosterone gels represent frequently used preparations. gel quickly absorbed stratum corneum, creating reservoir within subcutaneous tissues testosterone continuously delivered 24 hours, single daily application. formulations shown normalise serum testosterone levels excellent safety profile . introduction specific devices skin enhancers resulted better skin penetration drugs, thus reducing potential adverse effects. local skin adverse effects limited compared traditional testosterone patches, potentially allow transference testosterone close contact skin surface. risk reduced wearing clothing applying gel skin surfaces usually touched (e.g., inner thigh surface) . reduce total amount gel applied residual quantities remaining skin, new formulations testosterone gel introduced testosterone concentration 1.62-2% . another transdermal testosterone formulation includes topical, alcohol-based testosterone (2%) solution, must applied underarm daily, using metered dose applicator . testosterone formulation available europe. testosterone levels monitored optimise testosterone dose. blood collection best taken two four hours gel application use peak level testosterone absorbed reference adequate therapeutic levels. levels testosterone application vary repeat measurement may indicated especially sometimes, inadvertently, skin venipuncture site contaminated gel, leading falsely elevated results. european countries, dht available hydroalcoholic 2.5% gel. rapidly absorbed, reaching steady state two three days . similar reported mesterolone, dht aromatised useful treating particular conditions, gynaecomastia microphallus . 3.4.3.2.4. transmucosal formulations testosterone buccal system still available several countries. consists sustained-release muco-adhesive buccal-testosterone-tablet requiring twice-daily application upper gums. tablet dissolve completely mouth must removed twelve hours. formulation proven restore testosterone levels within physiological range minimal transient local problems, including gum oedema, blistering gingivitis . gel intranasal administration available countries, including usa canada. requires administration two three times daily using specific metered-dose pump. application rapid, non-invasive, convenient, avoids secondary transference observed topical products . preliminary results suggest intranasal testosterone associated lower suppression gn levels lower risk haematocrit increases . 3.4.3.2.5. subdermal depots implantation testosterone pellets, available limited number countries, represents longest available testosterone formulation lasting four seven months. procedure invasive may unattractive patients . 3.4.3.2.6. anti-oestrogens anti-oestrogens, including selective oestrogen receptor (er) modulators (serms) aromatase inhibitors (ai) suggested off-label treatments restore testosterone levels fertility men functional secondary
