3.3.4. Patient history. History taking should include past and present symptoms and disorders (Table 4). It is the cornerstone of evaluation, as the answers will aid selection of diagnostic investigations and treatment options. In non-traumatic neuro-urological patients with an insidious onset, a detailed history may find that the condition started in childhood or adolescence [54].Urinary history consists of symptoms associated with both urine storage and voiding.Bowel history is important because patients with neuro-urological symptoms may also have related neurogenic bowel dysfunction [55].Sexual function may be impaired because of the neuro-urological condition [56].Special attention should be paid to possible warning signs and symptoms (e.g., pain, infection, haematuria, and fever) requiring further investigation.Patients with SCI usually find it difficult to report urinary tract infection (UTI)-related symptoms accurately [57,58].The presence of urinary, bowel and sexual symptoms without neurological symptoms could be suggestive of an underlying neurological disease or condition.The severity of lesion after acute SCI does not predict the presence or absence of unfavourable urodynamic parameters [49].

Bladder diaries Bladder diaries are considered a valuable diagnostic tool for the initial assessment of neurogenic LUT dysfunction. They provide data on the number of voids (spontaneous or intermittent catheter), voided volume, stress/urgency/mixed urinary incontinence episodes and contribute to the interpretation of urodynamic testing. Preferably, bladder diaries should be completed for three consecutive days [59].
