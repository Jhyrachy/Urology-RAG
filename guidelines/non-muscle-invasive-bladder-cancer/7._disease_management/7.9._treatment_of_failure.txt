7.9. Treatment of failure of intravesical therapy. 7.9.1. Recurrence during or after intravesical chemotherapy Patients with NMIBC recurrence during or after a chemotherapy regimen can benefit from BCG instillations. Prior intravesical chemotherapy has no impact on the effect of BCG instillations [285]. 7.9.2. Treatment failure after intravesical BCG immunotherapy Several categories of BCG failures, broadly defined as any HG disease occurring during or after BCG therapy, have been proposed (see Table 7.2). Non-muscle-invasive BC may not respond at all (BCG refractory) or may relapse after initial response (BCG relapsing). Some evidence suggests that patients with BCG relapse have better outcomes than BCG refractory patients [394]. To be able to specify the subgroup of patients where additional BCG is unlikely to provide benefit, the category of BCG-unresponsive tumour was defined. Further BCG instillations in these patients are associated with an increased risk of progression [236,395]. The category of BCG-unresponsive tumours comprises BCG-refractory and some of BCG-relapsing tumours (see Table 7.2) [396]. The definition was developed in consultation with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), in particular to promote single-arm trials to provide primary evidence of effectiveness in this setting [397]. Patients who experience recurrence with high-grade NMIBC after BCG without meeting BCG-unresponsive criteria may benefit from additional BCG therapy. This category of high risk patients that lies between BCG-naïve and BCG-unresponsive NMIBC is termed BCG-exposed [398,399], and includes: BCG-resistant: persistent or recurrent Ta HG and/or CIS disease at three months following at least five of six doses of induction BCG. According to the definition of adequate BCG (table 7.2), these patients have received inadequate BCG.Delayed relapse after inadequate BCG: to indicate Ta/T1 HG or CIS patients found disease free at the three-months evaluation that recur in between 6 and 24 months without receiving more than an induction course.Delayed relapse after adequate BCG: to indicate patients that are disease free after adequate BCG, but subsequently experience a high-grade recurrence outside of the BCG-unresponsive window (>6 mo for Ta/T1 and >12 mo for CIS), up to 24 months. Non-HG recurrence after BCG is not considered as BCG failure. Table 7.2: Categories of high-grade recurrence during or after BCG Whenever a MIBC is detected during follow-up.BCG-refractory tumour1.

If CIS (without concomitant papillary tumour) is present at 3 months and persists at 6 months after either re-induction or first course of maintenance. If patients with CIS present at 3 months, an additional BCG course can achieve a complete response in > 50% of cases [65,364,368].4.

Treatment of BCG-unresponsive tumours, BCG-exposed tumours, BCG relapses and LG recurrences after BCG treatment Patients with BCG-unresponsive disease are unlikely to respond to further BCG therapy; RC is therefore the standard and preferred option. Currently, several bladder preservation strategies are being investigated such as cytotoxic intravesical therapies [402-405], device assisted instillations [406-408], intravesical immunotherapy [409,410], combination therapies (mainly sequential chemotherapies see section 7.4.4.3), systemic immunotherapy [411] or gene therapy [412-414]. A phase III RCT including predominantly high-risk NMIBC patients failing at least a previous induction course of BCG, MMC combined with microwave-induced hyperthermia provided 35% overall DFS at 2 years as compared to 41% in the control arm (treated with either BCG, MMC or MMC and electromotive drug administration at the discretion of the investigator). In the pre-planned sub-analysis, MMC and microwave- induced thermotherapy showed lower response rates in CIS recurrences but higher DFS in non-CIS papillary tumours (53% vs. 24%) [408].  Promising data on BCG-unresponsive cohorts of patients with CIS alone or concomitant to papillary tumours were recently reported following new immunotherapies. Systemic pembrolizumab achieved a 40% complete response rate in a prospective phase II study which was maintained in 48% of patients for up to 12 months (n = 101), resulting in FDA approval of the study drug for this patient population [415]. Promising data from a phase III multicentre RCT with intravesical nadofaragene firadenovec showed a complete response in 53.4% of patients with BCG-unresponsive CIS which was maintained in 45% at one year in those who initially responded [416]. A secondary analysis indicates that a combination of post- treatment titres of serum anti–human adenovirus type-5 antibody and fold change from baseline can predict treatment efficacy [417]. Additional ongoing studies are addressing combination of intravesical or systemic immunotherapy [418,419]. A systematic review and meta-analysis including 4 RCTs and 24 single-arm studies (all currently available prospective studies) assessed bladder-sparing treatments following BCG failure [420]. The significant heterogeneity of both trial designs and patient characteristics included in these studies, the different definitions of BCG failures used, and missing information on prior BCG courses may account for the variability in efficacy for the different compounds assessed across different trials. A higher number of previous BCG courses, BCG refractory/unresponsive or CIS predicted lower response rates. The pooled 12-month response rates were 24% for trials with > 2 prior BCG courses and 36% for those with > 1 BCG courses. Initial response rate did not predict durable responses highlighting the need for longer-term follow-up. More recently, a systematic review assessing 42 prospective trials on bladder-preserving treatments after BCG showed that patients with papillary-only recurrences appeared more effectively treated (median recurrence free rate of 44% at 1 year, median progression-free rate of 89% at a median follow-up of 19 months) than CIS-containing tumours (median complete response rate of 17% at 1 year with a median progression-free rate of 95% at a median follow-up of 12 months), highlighting potential biological differences between these two tumour entities which should be analysed separately when reporting results of clinical trials [421]. At the present time, treatments other than RC are considered oncologically inferior in patients with BCG- unresponsive disease [236,395,400]. Various studies suggest that repeat-BCG therapy is appropriate for non-HG and even for some HG recurrent tumours; namely those relapsing beyond one year after BCG exposure (cases which do not meet the criteria of BCG-unresponsive disease) [399,422]. BCG exposed patients and late BCG relapses (beyond 24 months) are likely to benefit from further BCG [398,399]. Treatment decisions in LG recurrences after BCG (which are not considered as any category of BCG failure) should be individualised according to tumour characteristics. Little is known about the optimal treatment in patients with high-risk tumours who could not complete BCG instillations because of intolerance. 7.9.4.
