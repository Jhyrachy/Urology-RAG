7.6. Radical cystectomy for non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer. There are several reasons to consider immediate RC for selected patients with NMIBC:: The staging accuracy for T1 tumours by TURB is low with 27–51% of patients being upstaged to muscle- invasive tumour at RC [180,378-382].Some patients with NMIBC experience disease progression to muscle-invasive disease (Table 6.2).Patients who experience disease progression to muscle-invasive stage have a worse prognosis than those who present with ‘primary’ muscle-invasive disease [383,384]. The potential benefit of RC must be weighed against its risks, morbidity, and impact on quality of life (QoL) and discussed with patients, in a shared decision-making process. It is reasonable to propose immediate RC in those patients with NMIBC who are at very high risk of disease progression (see Section 6.3 and Tables 6.1 and 6.2) [73,177,221,223,385]. Early RC is strongly recommended in patients with BCG-unresponsive tumours and should be considered in BCG relapsing HG tumours as mentioned in Section 7.9 and Table 7.3. A delay in RC may lead to decreased disease-specific survival [386]. In patients in whom RC is performed before progression to MIBC, the 5-year DFS rate exceeds 80% [387-389].
