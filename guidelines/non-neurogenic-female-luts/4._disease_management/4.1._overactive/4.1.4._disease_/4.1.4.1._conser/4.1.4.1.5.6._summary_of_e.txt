4.1.4.1.5.6. Summary of evidence and recommendations for behavioural and physical therapies. Summary of evidenceLEPrompted voiding, either alone or as part of a behavioural modification programme, improves continence in elderly, care-dependent, people in the short-term.1bBladder training is effective for improvement of UUI in women, but efficacy appears to be lower than that of pharmacotherapy.1bPelvic floor muscle training may improve symptoms of frequency of OAB in women.1bElectrical stimulation may improve symptoms of OAB in some women, but the type and mode of delivery of ES remains variable and poorly standardised.1aPosterior tibial nerve stimulation is more effective than antimuscarinics in reducing UUI episodes but with no difference in improving other OAB symptoms.1aA maintenance programme of P-PTNS has been shown to be effective for up to 3 years.2aTranscutaneous-PTNS appears to be effective in reducing OAB symptom compared to sham treatment.1aTranscutaneous -PTNS is not inferior to percutaneous -PTNS with regard to improvement in urinary urgency, frequency, and QoL scores.1a RecommendationsStrength ratingOffer prompted voiding to adults with overactive bladder (OAB) who are cognitively impaired.StrongOffer bladder training as a first-line therapy to adults with OAB/urge urinary incontinence (UUI).StrongEnsure that pelvic floor muscle training programmes are as intensive as possible.StrongConsider posterior tibial nerve stimulation as an option for symptomatic improvement of OAB/UUI.Strong
