3.13.4. Management. The medical care of children with neurogenic bladder requires an on-going multidisciplinary approach. There is some controversy about optimal timing of the management; proactive vs. expectant management [706-708]. Even with a close expectant management e.g. in one series 11 out of 60 need augmentation within a follow-up of 16 years and 7 out of 58 had a decrease in total renal function, which was severe in two [709]. During the treatment it should also be taken into account in spina bifida patients, that QoL is related to urinary incontinence independent of the type and level of spinal dysraphism and the presence or absence of a liquor shunt [710]. Foetal open and endoscopic surgery for meningomyelocele are performed to close the defect as early as possible in order to reduce neurological, orthopaedic and urological problems [711]. In the MOMS-Trial, Brooks et al. found no difference between those closed in utero vs. those closed after birth concerning the need for CIC [677], but less bladder trabeculation was found in the prenatal surgery group. Mean gestation age (28.3 vs. 35.2) seems to have no initial impact on bladder function in the first few years of life [712]. Two European series showed, that there is a possible benefit of open intrauterine closure on urinary continence showing normal bladder function in up to 33% at least in the first 2-3 years of life [713] [714]. Despite these promising reports [712,715-717], caregivers need to be aware of the high risk of developing a neurogenic bladder as demonstrated by a Brazilian group [718]. Regular and close follow-up examinations including UD are indicated in all these patients.
