3.13. fournier’s gangrene (necrotising fasciitis perineum external genitalia). 3.13.1. epidemiology, aetiology pathophysiology fournier’s gangrene aggressive frequently fatal polymicrobial soft tissue infection perineum, peri-anal region, external genitalia . anatomical sub-category necrotising fasciitis shares common aetiology management pathway. 3.13.2. diagnostic evaluation typically, painful swelling scrotum perineum sepsis . examination shows small necrotic areas skin surrounding erythema oedema. crepitus palpation foul-smelling exudate occurs advanced disease. patient risk factors occurrence mortality include immunocompromised, commonly diabetes malnutrition, recent urethral perineal surgery, high body mass index (bmi). 40% cases, onset insidious undiagnosed pain often resulting delayed treatment . high index suspicion careful examination, particularly obese patients, required. computed tomography mri help define para-rectal involvement, suggesting need bowel diversion . 3.13.3. disease management degree internal necrosis usually vastly greater suggested external signs, consequently, adequate, repeated surgical debridement urinary diversion suprapubic catheter necessary reduce mortality . consensus case series suggests surgical debridement early (< 24 hours) complete, delayed and/or inadequate surgery may result higher mortality . immediate empiric parenteral antibiotic treatment given covers probable causative organisms penetrate inflammatory tissue. suggested regime would comprise broad-spectrum penicillin third-generation cephalosporin, gentamicin metronidazole clindamycin . refined, guided microbiological culture. 3.13.4. evidence summary systematic literature search 1980 july 2017 performed. 640 references one rct , two systematic reviews , one narrative review , three registry studies [417-419], one prospective cohort study two retrospective comparative cohort studies least 25 patients selected. three registry studies united states [417-419], found mortality rates 10%, 7.5% 5% 650, 1,641 9,249 cases, respectively. older age, diabetes high bmi associated higher risk. prospective cohort study showed disease-specific severity scores predict outcome, superior generic scoring systems critical care . evidence questions addressed were: best antimicrobial treatment strategy reduce mortality?what best debridement reconstruction strategy reduce mortality aid recovery?are effective adjuvant treatments improve outcome? concerning evidence questions: low-quality retrospective case series 168 patients found significant difference mortality patients given ≤ 10 days parenteral antibiotics (80 patients) given > 10 days (88 patients).a systematic review wound closure techniques found low-quality evidence 16 case series involving 425 male patients. recommended primary secondary wound closure scrotal defects ≤ 50% use flaps skin grafts defects involving > 50% scrotum extension outside scrotum.a systematic review use hyperbaric oxygen therapy included three comparative case series four case series. retrospective published prior 2000. consistent evidence benefit found; rct advised. recent comparative case series suggested benefit use hyperbaric oxygen therapy 16 patients compared 12 cases without use therapy terms reduced mortality fewer debridements (low quality evidence). low-quality rct 30 patients found use honey-soaked dressings resulted shorter hospital stay (28 vs. 32 days) dressing soaked edinburgh solution lime (eusol). found evidence benefit use negative-pressure (vacuum) wound therapy fournier’s gangrene. 3.13.5. summary evidence recommendations disease management fournier’s gangrene summary evidenceleimmediate empiric parenteral antibiotic treatment given covers probable causative organisms penetrate inflammatory tissue.3a systematic review wound closure techniques recommended primary secondary wound closure scrotal defects ≤ 50% use flaps skin grafts defects involving > 50% scrotum extension outside scrotum.3no consistent evidence benefit hyperbaric oxygen therapy found.3a low quality rct found dressings soaked honey resulted shorter hospital stay dressing soaked eusol.3no evidence benefit use negative-pressure (vacuum) wound therapy fournier’s gangrene found.4 recommendationsstrength ratingstart treatment fournier’s gangrene broad-spectrum antibiotics presentation, subsequent refinement according culture clinical response.strongcommence repeated surgical debridement fournier’s gangrene within 24 hours presentation.strongdo use adjunctive treatments fournier’s gangrene except context clinical trials.weak table 11: suggested regimens antimicrobial therapy fournier’s gangrene mixed microbiological aetiology adapted . antimicrobialdosagepiperacillin-tazobactam plusvancomycin4.5 g every 6-8 h iv15 mg/kg every 12 himipenem-cilastatin1 g every 6-8 h ivmeropenem1 g every 8 h ivertapenem1 g dailygentamicin5 mg/kg dailycefotaxime plusmetronidazole orclindamycin2 g every 6 h iv500 mg every 6 h iv600-900 mg every 8 h ivcefotaxime plusfosfomycin plusmetronidazole2 g every 6 h iv5 g every 8 h iv500 mg every 6 h iv iv = intravenous.
