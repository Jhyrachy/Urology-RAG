5.12. New methods of tumour visualisation. As a standard procedure, cystoscopy and TURB are performed using white light (WL). However, the use of WL alone can lead to missing lesions that are present but not visible, which is why new technologies are being developed. 5.12.1. Photodynamic diagnosis (fluorescence cystoscopy or blue light cystoscopy) Photodynamic diagnosis is performed using blue light after intravesical instillation of 5-aminolaevulinic acid (ALA) or hexaminolaevulinic acid (HAL). 5.12.1.1. Impact on bladder cancer detection It has been confirmed that fluorescence-guided biopsy and resection are more sensitive than conventional procedures for the detection of malignant tumours, particularly CIS [181,182] (LE: 1a). In a systematic review and meta-analysis, PDD had higher sensitivity than WL endoscopy in the pooled estimates for analyses at both the patient-level (92% vs. 71%) and biopsy-level (93% vs. 65%) [182]. A prospective RCT did not confirm a higher detection rate in patients with known positive cytology before TURB [183]. Photodynamic diagnosis had lower specificity than WL endoscopy (63% vs. 81%) and it does not help to rule out prostatic involvement [182]. False- positivity can be induced by inflammation or recent TURB and during the first 3 months after BCG instillation [184,185]. 5.12.1.2. Impact on bladder cancer recurrence The beneficial effect of ALA or HAL fluorescence cystoscopy on recurrence rate in patients with TURB was evaluated. A systematic review and analysis of 14 RCTs including 2,906 patients, 6 using 5-ALA and 9 HAL, demonstrated a decreased risk of BC recurrence in the short and long term. There were, however, no differences in progression and mortality rates. The analysis demonstrated inconsistency between trials and potential susceptibility to performance and publication bias [186]. While a recent systematic review and meta-analysis of 12 RCTs (n = 2,288) revealed lower risk of recurrence and improved time to recurrence (at least in the first 2 years and possibly up to 5 years) with PDD [187], the most recent Cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis of 16 RCTs (n = 4,325) demonstrated that PDD-assisted TURBT may prolong not only recurrence over time but also risk of progression, albeit supported only by low certainty evidence [188]. This finding has been corroborated in a systematic review and meta-analysis of 12 RCTs involving 2,775 patients [189]. Contrary to previous evidence, a multicenter RCT from UK showed that PDD-guided TURBT did not reduce recurrence rates, nor was it cost-effective compared with WL cystoscopy at three years [190] . 5.12.2. Narrow-band imaging In narrow-band imaging (NBI), the contrast between normal urothelium and hyper-vascular cancer tissue is enhanced. Improved cancer detection has been demonstrated by NBI flexible cystoscopy and NBI-guided biopsies and resection [191-194] (LE: 3b). Two RCTs assessed the reduction of recurrence rates if NBI is used during TURB [194,195]. Although the overall results were negative, a benefit after three and twelve months was observed for low-risk tumours (pTa LG, < 30 mm, no CIS) [195]. A systematic review and meta-analysis by Russo et al., (17 RCTs and non-RCTs) demonstrated improved detection (diagnostic accuracy) of bladder tumours with either PDD or NBI over WL cystoscopy [196], while another one (including 5,217 patients) showed improved RFS with either enhancement technique [197]. Conversely, a systematic review and network meta-analysis that took into account the use of single post- operative instillation of chemotherapy, concluded that there was a lower likelihood of recurrence at one year only following PDD-guided TURB (with or without single instillation) but not with NBI-guided surgery [198]. 5.12.3. IMAGE1 S™, and other technologies IMAGE1 S™ (formerly named SPIES) is an image enhancement system based on a computerized processing of different colour components that uses specific light filters. Limited evidence has been produced so far in an attempt to validate the 4 different light spectra modalities, suggesting an improvement in the diagnostic accuracy of WL [199,200]. Early (18 months) follow-up data of an RCT failed to show an advantage in recurrence rate in the IMAGE1 S™ arm over WL, except in a subgroup of primary low intermediate-risk NMIBCs [201]. Confocal laser micro-endoscopy is a high-resolution imaging probe designed to provide endoscopic histological grading in real time but requires further validation [202].
