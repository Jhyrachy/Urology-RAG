6.3.1.2. single-stage augmentation urethroplasty. single-stage urethroplasty offers option reconstruction stricture without need multiple operations, associated peri-procedural risks, cosmetic functional implications definition follow first part staged urethroplasties [267-269]. evidence suggest considerable number patients (50% studies) offered first stage urethroplasty never returned second stage either satisfied functional status first stage (this particularly applied older men patients multiple failed procedures past) disappointed need another operation . sr mangera et al., overall patency rate types single-staged graft urethroplasties 75.7% average follow-up 32.8 months . patency rate different one-stage techniques particular are: dorsal omg (n=320): 63-100% [265,266,259,270-276];ventral omg (n=54): 55-92.6% ;double (dorsal + ventral) onlay penile/scrotal skin graft /omg (n=14/8/4): 88.5% ;dorsal penile skin graft (n=44): 62-78% ;penile skin flap (n=367): 67-100% [265,266,272-274,279]. high-level evidence exists state one technique superior another, seems dorsal graft location commonly used compared ventral one. mangera et al., reported patency rate better omg compared grafts (mainly penile skin) . jiang et al., showed combined (dorsal + ventral) bmg onlay significantly better stricture-free rates penoscrotal strictures (patency rate 88.9% vs. 60.9% single-onlay approach); however, follow-up significantly shorter double-onlay group . studies reported dedicated results sexual function parameters appear significantly impaired post-operatively . critical factor respect single-staged procedures careful selection patients, men long complex strictures might good candidates single-stage reconstruction attempts offer single-staged operations patients might lead higher recurrence rates. sometimes, selection done based intra-operative findings. therefore, scheduled single-staged procedure might converted staged one . palminteri et al., highlighted fact single-stage augmentation urethroplasties men ls-related strictures enlarge rather remove diseased segment urethra; therefore, always risk recurrence future . role previous interventions (especially multiple urethrotomies history previous urethroplasties) remains unclear several studies single-staged operations provide information previous procedures, excluded patients operations past . although favourable outcomes patients previous history urethrotomies/urethroplasties reported barbagli kulkarni, study pfalzgraf et al., recurrences post-previous urethroplasty took place single-stage group ekerhult et al., identified prior history urethral operations risk factor recurrence group single-stage procedures . addition previous urethral surgery, high bmi also identified poor prognostic factor single-stage penile urethroplasty .
