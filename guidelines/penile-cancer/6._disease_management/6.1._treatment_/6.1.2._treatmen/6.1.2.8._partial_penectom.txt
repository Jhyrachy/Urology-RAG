6.1.2.8. Partial penectomy. Amputative and partial amputative surgery is reserved for more advanced disease. Results of partial or total penectomy were reported in 5 heterogeneous studies with a total of 243 patients. 71.6% of men were staged as T1–T2 and the 5-year RFR was 75.8-95.4%. The cumulative mean 5-year RFR was 83.9% (204/243). Two cases series including T1 and T2 men, reported 92% and 95.4% 5-year RFRs after partial penectomy [3]. There is no comparative evidence between partial penectomy and glansectomy for T1–T2 lesions, however most case series report similar RFRs between penile-sparing surgery and amputative surgery. In a series of T1 and T2-only disease, 5-year RFR after amputative surgery were superior to penile-sparing surgery, indicating that a wider resection is protective against local recurrence and should always be discussed as an alternative option, although the higher RFRs observed after amputative surgery needs to be weighed against the impact on sexual function and QoL.
