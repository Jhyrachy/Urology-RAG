3.5.4. Renal oncocytoma. Oncocytoma is a benign tumour representing 4-7% of all solid renal tumours and 30% of benign surgically removed kidney masses are contributed to oncocytoma [25,37]. The diagnostic accuracy of imaging modalities (CT, magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) in renal oncocytoma is limited and histopathology remains the only reliable diagnostic modality [25,37]. However, 99mTc-sestamibi (SestaMIBI, MIBI) SPECT/CT has shown promising initial results for the differentiation between benign and low-grade RCC [38-41]. Standard treatment for renal oncocytoma is similar to that of other renal tumours; surgical excision by partial- or radical nephrectomy (RN) with subsequent histopathological verification. However, due to the inability of modern imaging techniques to differentiate benign from malignant renal masses, there is a renewed interest in renal mass biopsy (RMB) prior to surgical intervention. Accuracy of the biopsy and management of advanced/progressing oncocytomas need to be considered in this context since oncocytic renal neoplasms diagnosed by RMB at histological examination after surgery showed oncocytoma in only 64.6% of cases. The remainder of the tumours were mainly chRCC (18.7% including 6.3% hybrid oncocytic/chromophobe tumours which have now been grouped histologically with chRCC) [22,23], other RCCs (12.5%), and other benign lesions (4.2%) [42,43]. The 2022 WHO classification strictly excludes that a definitive diagnosis of oncocytoma be done on a needle-core biopsy. The majority of oncocytomas slowly progress in size with an annual growth rate of approximately 2 mm [37]. Preliminary data show that active surveilnace (AS) may be a safe option to manage oncocytoma in appropriately selected patients. Potential triggers to change management of patients on AS are not well defined [44,45].
