5.2.5. Phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors. Mechanism of action: Phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors (PDE5Is) increase intracellular cyclic guanosine monophosphate, thus reducing smooth muscle tone of the detrusor, prostate, and urethra. Nitric oxide and PDE5Is might also alter reflex pathways in the spinal cord and neurotransmission in the urethra, prostate, or bladder [249]. Moreover, chronic treatment with PDE5Is seems to increase blood perfusion and oxygenation in the LUT [250]. Phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors could also reduce chronic inflammation in the prostate and bladder [251]. The exact mechanism of PDE5Is on LUTS remains unclear. Although clinical trials of several selective oral PDE5Is have been conducted in men with LUTS, only tadalafil (5 mg once daily) has been licensed for the treatment of male LUTS. Efficacy: Randomised controlled trials have demonstrated that PDE5Is reduce IPSS, storage and voiding LUTS, and improve QoL. However, Qmax did not significantly differ from placebo in most trials [252]. A Cochrane review included a total of sixteen RCTs that examined the effects of PDE5Is compared to placebo and other standard of care drugs (α1-blockers and 5-ARIs) in men with LUTS [253]. In the updated meta-analysis, PDE5Is led to a small reduction (mean difference (MD) 1.89 lower; 95% CI: 2.27 lower to 1.50 lower; n = 4293) in IPSS compared to placebo [253]. There was no difference between PDE5Is and α1-blockers in IPSS [254]. Most evidence was limited to short-term treatment up to twelve weeks. In other meta-analyses, PDE5Is were also found to improve IPSS and IIEF score, but not always Qmax [255,256]. A meta-regression suggested that younger men with low body mass index and more severe LUTS benefit the most from treatment with PDE5Is [255]. In a post hoc analysis of data pooled from four blinded trials of tadalafil 5 mg vs. placebo once daily, a minimum improvement of 25% in IPSS score was found in 60% in the tadalafil and in 44% in the placebo group [257]. The maximum trial duration was 52 weeks [258]. A subgroup analysis of pooled data from four RCTs demonstrated a significant reduction in LUTS, regardless of baseline severity, age, previous use of α-blockers or PDE5Is, total testosterone level or predicted prostate volume [259]. In a post hoc analysis of pooled data from four RCTs, tadalafil was shown to also be effective in men with cardiovascular risk factors/co-morbidities, except for patients receiving more than one antihypertensive medication. Among sexually active men > 45 years, tadalafil improved both LUTS/BPH and ED [259]. An integrated data analyses from four placebo controlled clinical studies showed that total IPSS improvement was largely attributed to direct (92.5%) vs. indirect (7.5%) treatment effects via IIEF-EF improvement [260]. Another analysis showed a small but significant increase in Qmax without any effect on PVR [261]. An integrated analysis of RCTs showed that tadalafil was not superior to placebo for IPSS improvement at twelve weeks in men ≥ 75 years (with varied effect size between studies) but was for men < 75 years [262]. An open label urodynamic study of 71 patients showed significant improvements in both voiding and storage symptoms, confirmed by improvements in BOO index (61.3 to 47.1), and resolution of DO in fifteen (38%) of 38 patients. Flow rate improved from 7.1 to 9.1 mL/s and mean IPSS from 18.2 to 13.4 [263]. A multicentre, double blind, placebo controlled RCT compared once daily tadalafil 20 mg vs. placebo during twelve weeks in men with LUTS with or without BOO. Urodynamic measures including detrusor pressure at maximum urinary flow rate, Qmax, maximum detrusor pressure, BOO or bladder capacity remained largely unchanged during the study with no statistically significant or clinically adverse event differences between tadalafil and placebo [264]. A study has shown that in patients with OAB and LUT obstruction unresponsive to previous treatment, the simultaneous administration of solifenacin, tadalafil, and dutasteride could be an effective and safe choice [265]. Tolerability and safety: Reported adverse effects in RCTs comparing the effect of all PDE5Is vs. placebo in men with LUTS include flushing, gastroesophageal reflux, headache, dyspepsia, back pain and nasal congestion [255]. Tadalafil is contraindicated in patients using nitrates or guanylate cyclase stimulators, such as riociguat, and in men with cardiac disease for whom sexual activity is inadvisable [266]. Tadalafil is also contraindicated in patients with myocardial infarction within the last 90 days, - patients with unstable angina or angina occurring during sexual intercourse, - patients with New York Heart Association Class 2 or greater heart failure in the last six months, - patients with uncontrolled arrhythmias, hypotension (< 90/50 mm Hg), or uncontrolled hypertension, - patients with a stroke within the last six months or if anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy with sudden loss of vision is known or was reported after previous use of PDE5Is [266]. Detailed information regarding tolerability/safety of all available PDE5Is for the treatment of erectile dysfunction in men treated with α-blockers for LUTS are provided by the EAU Guidelines on Sexual and Reproductive Health [267]. Practical considerations: To date, only tadalafil 5 mg once daily has been officially licensed for the treatment of male LUTS with or without ED. Long-term experience with tadalafil in men with LUTS is limited to one trial with a one-year follow-up [258]; limiting conclusions about efficacy or tolerability greater than one year. There is limited information on reduction of prostate size and no data on disease progression.
