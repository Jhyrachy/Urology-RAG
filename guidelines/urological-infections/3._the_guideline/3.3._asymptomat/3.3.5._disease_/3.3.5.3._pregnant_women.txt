3.3.5.3. Pregnant women. 3.3.5.3.1. Is treatment of ABU beneficial in pregnant women? Twelve RCTs comparing antibiotic treatments of ABU with placebo controls or no treatment [33-44], with different antibiotic doses and regimens were identified, ten published before 1988 and one in 2015. Eleven RCTs (n=2,002) reported on the rate of symptomatic UTIs [33,35-43,45]. Antibiotic treatment significantly reduced the number of symptomatic UTIs compared to placebo or no treatment (average RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.40). Six RCTs reported on the resolution of bacteriuria [33-35,37,40,42]. Antibiotic treatment was effective in the resolution of bacteriuria compared to placebo (average RR 2.99, 95% CI 1.65 to 5.39; n=716). Eight RCTs reported on the rate of low birthweights [33,35-38,41,44,45]. Antibiotic treatment was associated with lower rates of low birthweight compared to placebo or no treatment (average RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.94; n=1689). Four RCTs reported on the rate of preterm deliveries [41,42,44,45]. Antibiotic treatment was associated with lower rates of preterm delivery compared to placebo or no treatment (average RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.66; n=854). Three additional systematic reviews and meta-analyses have reported that treatment of ABU in pregnancy may be associated with a decreased rate of pyelonephritis, low birthweight or preterm delivery [46-48]. However, they also emphasised the low to very low quality of the evidence of the identified studies. Based on the beneficial maternal and foetal effects of antibiotic treatment pregnant women should be screened and treated for ABU. However, the panel would like to emphasise that most available studies have low methodological quality and are from the 60s to 80s. Diagnostic and treatment protocols and accessibility to medical services have dramatically changed since then; therefore, the quality of evidence for this recommendation is low. In a newer study of higher methodological quality the beneficial effects of antibiotic treatment are not as evident [45]. Therefore, it is advisable to consult national recommendations for pregnant women. 3.3.5.3.2. Which treatment duration should be applied to treat ABU in pregnancy? Sixteen RCTs comparing the efficacy of different antibiotic treatments in pregnant women with ABU were identified [49-64]. There was significant heterogeneity amongst the studies. Studies compared different antibiotic regimens or the same antibiotic regimens with different durations. The duration of treatment ranged from single dose to continuous treatment (until delivery). For practical purposes the grouping strategy used by the previously published Cochrane Review by Widmer et al. was adopted with some modifications [65]. The following treatment groups were used for comparison: single dose (single day);short course (2-7 days);long course (8-14 days);continuous (until delivery). Nine studies compared single dose to short course treatment [50,54,55,59-64], one study compared single dose to long course treatment [58] and one study compared long course to continuous treatment [51]. As long term and continuous antibiotic treatment is not used in current practice, only studies comparing single dose to standard short course treatment are presented. 3.3.5.3.2.1. Single dose vs. short course treatment Three RCTs reported on the rate of symptomatic UTIs [54,63,64], with no significant difference between the two durations (average RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.47 to 2.47; n=891). Nine RCTs reported on the rate of ABU resolution [50,54,55,59-64], with no significant difference between the two durations (average RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.07; n=1,268). Six RCTs reported on the rate of side effects [50,54,59,60,62,63]. Single dose treatment was associated with significantly less side effects compared to short course treatment (average RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.72; n=458). Three RCTs reported on the rate of preterm deliveries [54,56,64], with no significant difference between the two durations (average RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.78; n=814). One RCT reported on the rate of low birthweights [64]. There were significantly more babies with low birthweight in the single dose duration compared to short course treatment (average RR 1.65, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.57; n=714). According to the data analysis, single dose treatment was associated with a significantly lower rate of side effects but a significantly higher rate of low birthweight. A meta-analysis on the use of single dose fosfomycin trometamol in women with lower uncomplicated UTIs or ABU reported on a subgroup analysis of pregnant women with ABU [66]. The study identified five RCTs involving 577 patients. The resolution rate of ABU in pregnant women treated with single dose fosfomycin trometamol was not significantly different from those who received other antibiotics (OR 1.32, 95% CI 0.78â€“2.22, p=0.30). Therefore, standard short course treatment or single dose fosfomycin trometamol should be applied to treat ABU in pregnancy; however, it should be emphasised that the overall quality of the scientific evidence backing this recommendation is low.
