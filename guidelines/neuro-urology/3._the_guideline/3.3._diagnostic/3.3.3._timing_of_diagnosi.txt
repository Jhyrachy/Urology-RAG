3.3.3. Timing of diagnosis and treatment. Early diagnosis and treatment are essential in both congenital and acquired neuro-urological disorders. This helps to prevent irreversible changes within the LUT, even in the presence of normal reflexes [49]. Furthermore, urological symptoms can be the presenting feature of neurological pathology [50,51]. Early intervention can prevent irreversible deterioration of the LUT and UUT [51]. Long term follow-up (life-long) is mandatory to assess risk of UUT damage and renal failure [52,53].
