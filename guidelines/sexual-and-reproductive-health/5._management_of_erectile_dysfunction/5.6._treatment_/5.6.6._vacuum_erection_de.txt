5.6.6. Vacuum erection devices. Published data report that efficacy, in terms of erections satisfactory for intercourse, is as high as 90%, regardless of the cause of ED and satisfaction rates range between 27% and 94% [412,413]. Long-term use of VEDs decreases to 50-64% after two years [414]. The most common adverse events include pain, inability to ejaculate, petechiae, bruising, and numbness [413]. Serious adverse events (skin necrosis) can be avoided if patients remove the constriction ring within 30 minutes. Vacuum erection devices are contraindicated in patients with bleeding disorders or on anticoagulant therapy [415,416]. Vacuum erection devices may be the treatment of choice in well-informed older patients with infrequent sexual intercourse and comorbidity requiring non-invasive, drug-free management of ED [412,413,417].
