7.1.4.1. Active surveillance and watchful waiting. Elderly and comorbid patients with incidental SRMs have a low RCC-specific mortality and significant competing-cause mortality [367,368]. In this regard, beyond age and comorbidities, frailty has been increasingly recognised as a major risk factor for adverse perioperative and oncological outcomes in patients with genitourinary malignancies. Frailty is a geriatric syndrome characterised by a decline in individuals’ resilience and physiological functional reserve across multiple body systems, resulting in increased vulnerability to external stressors [369]. The Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment is considered the gold standard of care for older patients in several settings, given its ability to identify frailty and risk of geriatric syndromes and the positive impact on patients’ outcomes. A SR evaluatig the impact of frailty on perioperative and oncologic outcomes in patients undergoing surgery or ablation for RCC found low-quality evidence pointing to frailty and sarcopenia as potential independent risk factors for worse perioperative and oncological outcomes across different RCC stages. Active surveillance is defined as the initial monitoring of tumour size by serial abdominal imaging (US, CT, or MRI) with delayed intervention reserved for tumours showing clinical progression during follow-up [370]. The concept of AS differs from the concept of ‘Watchful Waiting’; Watchful Waiting is reserved for patients whose comorbidities contra-indicate any subsequent active treatment and who do not require follow-up imaging, unless clinically indicated. Population-based studies compared the oncological outcomes of surgery (RN or PN) and non-surgical management for tumours < 4 cm. The analyses showed a significantly lower CSM in patients treated with surgery [281,371,372]. However, the patients assigned to the surveillance arm were older and likely to be frailer and less suitable for surgery. Other-cause mortality rates in the non-surgical group significantly exceeded that of the surgical group [371]. Analyses of older patients (> 75 years) failed to show the same benefit in CSM for surgical treatment [280,373,374]. Growth rate and metastasisIn the largest reported series of AS the growth of renal tumours was low and progression to metastatic disease was reported in only a limited number of patients [375,376]. A SR of eighteen AS cohorts comprising 2,066 patients (cT1-2 N0M0) with a pooled mean follow-up of 53 months, showed that 2.1% (95% CI: 1.0-3.6) of patients developed metastatic disease during follow-up [377]. For patients with SRMs (nine studies, n = 987), the pooled metastasis rate was 1.8% (95% CI: 0.5-3.7). In 136 biopsy-proven SRMs managed by AS, median follow-up of patients who remained on AS was 5.8 years (interquartile range 3.4-7.5 years). Clear-cell RCC grew faster than papillary type 1 SRMs (0.25 and 0.02 cm/year on average, respectively, p = 0.0003). Overall, 60 (44.1 %) of the malignant SRMs progressed; 49 (82%) by rapid growth (volume doubling), seven (12%) increasing to ≥ 4 cm, and four (6.7%) by both criteria. Six patients developed metastases, and all were of ccRCC histology [378]. Overall- and cancer-specific survivalA single-institutional comparative study evaluating patients aged > 75 years showed decreased OS for those who underwent surveillance and nephrectomy relative to NSS for clinically T1 renal tumours. However, at multivariate analysis, management type was not associated with OS after adjusting for age, comorbidities, and other variables [367]. No statistically significant differences in OS and CSS were observed in another study of RN vs. PN vs. AS for T1a renal masses with a follow-up of 34 months [379]. The prospective non-randomised multi-institutional Delayed Intervention and Surveillance for Small Renal Masses (DISSRM) study enrolled 497 patients with solid renal masses < 4 cm who selected either AS or primary active intervention. Patients who selected AS were older, had worse ECOG scores, more comorbidities, smaller tumours, and more often had multiple and bilateral lesions. In patients who elected AS in this study the overall median SRM growth rate was 0.09 cm/year with a median follow-up of 1.83 years. The growth rate and variability decreased with longer follow-up. No patients developed metastatic disease or died of RCC [380,381]. Overall survival for primary intervention and AS was 98% and 96% at two years, and 92% and 75% at five years, respectively (p = 0.06). At five years, CSS was 99% and 100%, respectively (p = 0.3). Active surveillance was not predictive of OS or CSS in regression modelling with relatively short follow-up [380]. In the previously mentioned large SR of eighteen AS cohorts 1.0% (95% CI: 0.3-2.1) died from RCC and 22.6% (95% CI: 15.8-30.2) died from any cause. For patients with SRMs RCC-specific mortality was 0.6% (95% CI: 0-2.1), and all-cause mortality was 28.5% (95% CI: 17.4-41.4) [377]. A study using data from the DISSRM Registry investigated the outcomes of active surveillance in a cohort of patients aged 60 or younger at diagnosis [382]. Of 224 patients with median follow-up of 4.9 years, 30.4% chose surveillance. There were 20 (29.4%) surveillance progression events, including four elective crossovers, and 13 (19.1%) patients underwent delayed intervention. Among patients with initial tumour size ≤ 2 cm, 15.1% crossed over, compared to 33.3% with initial tumour size 2-4 cm. Overall survival was similar in primary intervention and surveillance at 7 years (94.0% vs 90.8%, log-rank p = 0.2). Cancer-specific survival remained at 100% for both groups. Recurrence-free survival at five years was 96.0% and 100% for primary and delayed intervention, respectively (log-rank p = 0.6). Overall, both short- and intermediate-term oncological outcomes indicate that in selected patients with advanced age and/or comorbidities, AS is appropriate for initially monitoring of SRMs, followed, if required, by treatment for progression [370,375,376,383-386]. Quality of lifeA multicentre study assessed QoL of patients undergoing immediate intervention vs. AS. Patients undergoing immediate intervention had higher QoL scores at baseline, specifically for physical health. The perceived benefit in physical health persisted for at least one year following intervention. Mental health, which includes domains of depression and anxiety, was not adversely affected while on AS [387].
