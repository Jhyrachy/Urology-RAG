7.3.1. Removal of the tumour-bearing bladder. 7.3.1.1. Introduction For decades, the standard treatment for patients with MIBC consisted of RC, pelvic LN dissection, and urinary diversion, with or without NAC [603]. However, an increasing focus on quality of life contributes to a growing trend to use bladder-sparing approaches such as RT or TMT in selected patients (see section 7.5). A multi-institutional propensity score matched and weighted analysis showed comparable oncological outcomes between radical cystectomy and TMT for selected MIBC patients [328]. Performance status and life expectancy obviously influence the choice of primary treatment, as does the type of urinary diversion, with RC being reserved for patients with longer life expectancy without concomitant disease and better PS. 7.3.1.2. Radical cystectomy: timing A meta-analysis including 19 studies concluded that a delay of > 3 months has a negative effect on OS (HR: 134, 95% CI: 1.18â€“1.53). Authors highlighted the lack of standardisation regarding the definition of delays which made it impossible to identify a clear cut-off time [329]. Overall conclusion was that BC patients scheduled for RC should be treated without delays to maximise survival.
