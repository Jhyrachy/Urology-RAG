6.6. Retrograde ejaculation. 6.6.1. Definition and classification Retrograde ejaculation is the total, or sometimes partial, absence of antegrade ejaculation, due to semen passing backwards through the bladder neck into the bladder. Patients may experience a normal or decreased orgasmic sensation. The causes of retrograde ejaculation can be divided into neurogenic, pharmacological, urethral, or bladder neck incompetence [754]. 6.6.2. Pathophysiology and risk factors The process of ejaculation requires complex co-ordination and interplay between the epididymis, vas deferens, prostate, seminal vesicles, bladder neck and bulbourethral glands [776]. Upon ejaculation, sperm are rapidly conveyed along the vas deferens and into the urethra via the ejaculatory ducts. From there, the semen progresses in an antegrade fashion, partly maintained by coaptation of the bladder neck and rhythmic contractions of the periurethral muscles, co-ordinated by a centrally mediated reflex [776]. Closure of the bladder neck and seminal emission is initiated via the sympathetic nervous system from the lumbar sympathetic ganglia and subsequently hypogastric nerve. Prostatic and seminal vesicle secretion, as well as contraction of the bulbo-cavernosal, ischio-cavernosal and pelvic floor muscles are initiated by the S 2-4 parasympathetic nervous system via the pelvic nerve [776]. Any factor that disrupts this reflex and inhibits contraction of the bladder neck (internal vesical sphincter) may lead to retrograde passage of semen into the bladder. These can be broadly categorised as pharmacological, neurogenic, anatomic and endocrinal causes of retrograde ejaculation (Table 14).

Disease management 6.6.3.1. Pharmacological Sympathomimetics stimulate the release of noradrenaline and activate α- and β-adrenergic receptors, resulting in the closure of the internal urethral sphincter, restoring the antegrade flow of semen. The most common sympathomimetics are synephrine, pseudoephedrine hydrochloride, ephedrine, phenylpropanolamine and midodrine [777]. Unfortunately, as time progresses, their effect diminishes [778]. Many studies published about the efficacy of sympathomimetics in the treatment of retrograde ejaculation suffer from small sample size, with some represented by case reports. An RCT randomised patients to receive one of four α-adrenergic agents (dextroamphetamine, ephedrine, phenylpropanolamine and pseudoephedrine) with or without histamine. The patients suffered from failure of ejaculation following retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy. They found that four days of treatment prior to ejaculation was the most effective and that all the adrenergic agonists restored antegrade ejaculation [777]. In a systematic review, the efficacy of this group of medications was found to be 28% [211]. The adverse effects of sympathomimetics include dryness of mucous membranes and hypertension. The use of antimuscarinics has been described, including brompheniramine maleate and imipramine, as well as in combination with sympathomimetics. The calculated efficacy of antimuscarinics alone or in combination with sympathomimetics is 22% and 39%, respectively [211]. Combination therapy appears to be more effective, although statistical analysis is not yet possible due to the small sample sizes. 6.6.3.2. Management of infertility Infertility has been the major concern of patients with retrograde ejaculation. Beyond standard sperm-retrieval techniques, such as testicular sperm aspiration/extraction (TESA/TESE), three different methods of sperm acquisition have been identified for managing infertility in patients with retrograde ejaculation. These include: i) centrifugation and resuspension of post-ejaculatory urine specimens; ii) the Hotchkiss (or modified Hotchkiss) technique; and, iii) ejaculation on a full bladder. Centrifugation and resuspension. In order to improve the ambient conditions for the sperm, the patient is asked to increase their fluid intake or take sodium bicarbonate to dilute or alkalise the urine, respectively. Afterwards, a post-orgasmic urine sample is collected by introducing a catheter or spontaneous voiding. This sample is then centrifuged and suspended in a medium. The types of suspension fluids are heterogeneous and can include bovine serum albumin, human serum albumin, Earle’s/Hank’s balanced salt solution and the patient’s urine. The resultant modified sperm mixture can then be used in assisted reproductive techniques. A systematic review of studies in couples in which the male partner had retrograde ejaculation found a 15% pregnancy rate per cycle (0-100%) [211].Hotchkiss method. The Hotchkiss method involves emptying the bladder prior to ejaculation, using a catheter, and then washing out and instilling a small quantity of Lactated Ringers to improve the ambient condition of the bladder. The patient then ejaculates, and semen is retrieved by catheterisation or voiding [779]. Modified Hotchkiss methods involve variance in the instillation medium. Pregnancy rates were 24% per cycle (0-100%) [211].Ejaculation on a full bladder. The patient is encouraged to ejaculate on a full bladder and semen is suspended in Baker’s Buffer. The pregnancy rate in the two studies, which included only five patients, have described results using this technique [780,781].
