epidemiology, aetiology pathophysiology priapism prolonged full partial erection penis unrelated sexual stimuli lasting ≥ 4 hours. although prevalence priapism children well reported literature, considered rare disease. common cause priapism children sickle cell disease (scd), accounts 65% cases, followed leukemia (10%), trauma (10%), idiopathic (10%) drugs (5%) . patients scd, mean age first episode priapism shown 15 years old, 25% presenting prepubertally . 3.21.3.2. classification priapism children divided four groups: ischaemic (low-flow) priapism, stuttering priapism, non-ischaemic (high-flow) priapism, neonatal priapism. ischaemic (low-flow, veno-occlusive) priapism common form (95%) children. presents painful, rigid erection, decreased absent intracavernous arterial inflow. considered medical emergency, since duration ≥ 4 hours cause ischaemia within corpora cavernosa, eventually irreversible damage, smooth muscle necrosis, corporal fibrosis erectile dysfunction . stuttering priapism presents recurrent, self-limiting prolonged erections, intervening periods detumescence. often precedes episode ischaemic (low-flow) priapism . non-ischaemic (high-flow, arterial) priapism prolonged erection penis lasting ≥ 4 hours associated ischaemia. common cause penile, perineal pelvic trauma, lead development arteriolar-sinusoidal arteriocavernous fistula, usually delayed presentation trauma (3 hours – 7 days) . neonatal priapism rare condition, case series described literature. presents prolonged erection penis ≥ 4 hours new-born. sickle cell disease associated neonatal priapism due presence foetal haemoglobin. commonly idiopathic, polycythaemia common cause among identifiable causes . favourable natural history benign pathophysiology. 3.21.3.3. diagnostic
