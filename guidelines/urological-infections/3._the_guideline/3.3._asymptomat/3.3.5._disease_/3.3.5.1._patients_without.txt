3.3.5.1. Patients without identified risk factors. Asymptomatic bacteriuria does not cause renal disease or damage [31]. Only one prospective, non-randomised study investigated the effect of treatment of ABU in adult, non-diabetic, non-pregnant women [32], and found no difference in the rate of symptomatic UTIs. Furthermore, as the treatment of ABU has been proven to be unnecessary in most high-risk patient subgroups, there is panel consensus that the results of these subgroups can also be applied to patients without identified risk factors. Therefore, screening and treatment of ABU is not recommended in patients without risk factors.
