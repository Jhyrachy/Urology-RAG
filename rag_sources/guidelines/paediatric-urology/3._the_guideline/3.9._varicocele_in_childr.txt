3.9. varicocele children adolescents. 3.9.1. epidemiology, aetiology pathophysiology varicocele defined abnormal dilatation testicular veins pampiniformis plexus caused venous reflux. unusual boys ten years age becomes frequent beginning puberty. found 14-20% adolescents, similar incidence adulthood. appears mostly left side (78-93% cases). right-sided varicoceles less common; usually noted bilateral varicoceles present seldom occur isolated finding [405-407]. varicocele develops accelerated body growth increased blood flow testes, mechanism clearly understood. genetic factors may present . anatomic abnormality leading impaired venous drainage expressed considerable prevalence left side condition internal spermatic vein drains renal vein. varicocele induce apoptotic pathways heat stress, androgen deprivation accumulation toxic materials . 70% patients grade ii iii varicocele, left testicular volume loss found. abnormal reproductive hormonal levels (increased serum levels fsh lh, decreased levels inhibin b) semen quality reported varicocele patients directly related varicocele severity [412-414]. severe histological damage found 20% adolescents affected, abnormal findings 46% affected adolescents. histological findings similar children adolescents infertile men. 20% adolescents varicocele, fertility problems arise . adverse influence varicocele increases time. 3.9.2. classification systems varicocele classified 3 grades : grade - valsalva positive (palpable valsalva manoeuvre only);grade ii - palpable (palpable without valsalva manoeuvre);grade iii - visible (visible distance). 3.9.3. diagnostic evaluation varicocele, mostly asymptomatic, generally noticed patient caregivers, discovered paediatrician routine visit. diagnosis depends upon clinical finding collection dilated tortuous veins upright posture; veins pronounced patient performs valsalva manoeuvre. clinical examination shoud include evaluation size testicles detect smaller testis. pre-pubertal boys isolated right varicocele, renal us routinely added order rule secondary varicocele due retroperitoneal tumour extending renal vein inferior vena cava. testicular volume measured us

upright position valsalva manoeuvre . venous reflux detected us classified subclinical varicocele. severity reflux doppler us shown correlate testicular damage . sperm analysis principle allows assessment testicular function, world health organization (who) parameters intended pre-pubertal patients, spontaneous improvements abnormal sperm analyses observed pre-pubertal patients . moreover, sperm analysis encounters cultural/ethical barriers children . therefore, semen analysis widely used generally recommended older adolescents. order assess testicular injury adolescents varicocele, supranormal fsh lh responses luteinising hormone-releasing hormone (lhrh) stimulation test considered reliable, histopathological testicular changes found patients . 3.9.4. management evidence treatment varicocele paediatric age offer better andrological outcome operation performed later earlier diagnosis convey pressing need intervene . beneficial effect pubertal screening treatment varicocele regarding preservation fertility final chance paternity controversial [425-427]. recommended indication criteria correction varicocele children adolescents : varicocele associated small testis (this confirmed two subsequent visits performed six months apart) asynchronous testicular growth account temporary asymmetry also considerable number healthy adolescents . additional scenarios varicocele treatment considered case case basis include: symptomatic varicocele . pain present 2-10% varicoceles. association varicocele pain unclear patients informed pain persist varicocelectomy 20% cases ;additional testicular condition affecting fertility contralateral testicular condition;bilateral palpable varicocele;pathological sperm quality (in older adolescents);cosmetic reasons related scrotal swelling. reduced total testicular volume (left + right) comparison normal testes promising indication criterion, normal values available . repair large varicocele, causing physical psychological discomfort, may also considered. varicoceles followed-up reliable sperm analysis performed. 3.9.4.1. surgical management surgical intervention based ligation occlusion internal spermatic veins. ligation performed different levels: inguinal (or subinguinal) microsurgical ligation;suprainguinal ligation, using open laparoscopic techniques [430-433]. advantage former lower invasiveness procedure, advantage latter considerably lower number veins ligated safety incidental division internal spermatic artery suprainguinal level. surgical ligation, form optical magnification (microscopic laparoscopic) used internal spermatic artery 0.5 mm diameter level internal ring . suprainguinal approach, artery sparing varicocelectomy may offer advantage regards catch-up growth associated higher incidence recurrent varicocele . lymphatic-sparing varicocelectomy preferred prevent hydrocele formation testicular hypertrophy development achieve better testicular function according lhrh stimulation test . methods choice subinguinal inguinal microsurgical (microscopic) repairs, suprainguinal open laparoscopic lymphatic-sparing repairs . later, intrascrotal/intratesticular injection isosulphan blue recommended visualise lymphatic vessels 3.9.4.2. radiological management angiographic occlusion internal spermatic veins also meets requirements lymphatic sparing repair. based retrograde antegrade sclerotisation internal spermatic veins . however, although method less invasive may require general anaesthesia, associated radiation burden, less controllable antegrade technique . low moderate level evidence radiological surgical treatment adolescent varicocele associated improved testicular size/growth sperm concentration. several authors reported testicular catch-up growth varicocelectomy adolescents . average proportion catch-up growth 76.4% (range: 52.6-93.8%) found according meta-analysis (le: 2a). however, may partly attributable testicular oedema associated division lymphatic vessels . improvement sperm parameters demonstrated adolescent varicocelectomy [421,447-449]. one study, microsurgical varicocele repair adolescents varicocele significantly increases paternity rates decreases time conception post-operatively, needs confirmed series. ultimate effects fertility paternity rates known . panel conducted systematic review meta-analysis regarding treatment varicocele children adolescents . 1,550 articles identified, 98 articles including 16,130 patients eligible inclusion (12 rcts, 47 nrss 39 case series). key findings summarised following paragraphs: meta-analysis twelve rcts revealed varicocele treatment improved testicular volume (mean difference 1.52 ml, 95% ci 0.73-2.31) increased total sperm concentration (mean difference 25.54, 95% ci 12.84-38.25) compared observation. lymphatic sparing surgery significantly decreased hydrocele rates (p=0.02) 0.08 (95% ci 0.01, 0.67). due lack rcts, possible identify surgical technique superior others. remains unclear whether open surgery laparoscopy successful varicocele treatment (or ranged 0.13 2.84). success rates treatment (disappearance varicocele) 85.1% 100% whereas complication rates 0% 29% included studies. common complication reported hydrocele. resolution pain treatment 90% reported series. major reason varicocele recurrence persistence branched spermatic veins ligated initial repair. treatment recurrence warranted patients clinical recurrence show improvement testicular asymmetry remain symptomatic. treatment recurrence surgical via embolisation. generally, technique different primary repair recommended operate virgin field . conclusion, moderate evidence exists benefits varicocele treatment children adolescents terms testicular volume sperm concentration. current evidence demonstrate superiority surgical/interventional techniques regarding treatment success. lymphatic sparing surgery significantly decreases hydrocele formation. long-term outcomes, including paternity fertility, still remain unknown. conclusion, moderate evidence exists benefits varicocele treatment children adolescents terms testicular volume
