3.23.5. Premedication management: general information. The majority of children undergoing anaesthesia and surgery develop anxiety that could lead to adverse reactions. Many factors may influence preoperative anxiety [1582]. Anxiety and distress can be prevented or relieved combining: premedication, distraction techniques and parental or caregivers presence. Non-pharmacological age-appropriate methods such as play therapy, toys, storybooks, videos, tablet, mobile phone, can all be useful. A successful plan must therefore take into account the age and temperament of the child [1583]. The most important goal of premedication is to alleviate patients’ anxiety and facilitates a smooth separation of the child from their parents/caregivers. Pre-anaesthetic sedatives in children have to be given in a timely fashion pre-operatively, and include midazolam, clonidine, ketamine and dexmedetomidine are used as premedication but no consensus has been reached on the best choice against pre-operative anxiety. Clinicians should select the appropriate premedication depending on the patient’s age, disease and psychological status [1584]. Topical anaesthesia should be used to reduce or eliminate the pain and anxiety of an intravenous access placement when an intravenous induction is required. The most commonly used local anaesthetic creams requires 20 to 60 minutes for maximal effect but they can cause vasoconstriction that could make the vein harder to see and cannulate [1582,1584]. 3.23.5.1.
