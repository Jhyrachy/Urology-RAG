3.16.2. Specific procedures and evidence question. An updated literature search from February 2017 (cut-off of last update) to June 2021 identified RCTs, systematic reviews and meta-analyses that investigated the benefits and harms of using antibiotic prophylaxis prior to specific urological procedures. The available evidence enabled the panel to make recommendations concerning urodynamics, cystoscopy, stone procedures (extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy [ESWL], ureteroscopy and percutaneous nephrolithotomy [PCNL]), transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) and transurethral resection of the bladder (TURB). For nephrectomy and prostatectomy the scientific evidence was too weak to allow the panel to make recommendations either for or against antibiotic prophylaxis. The general evidence question was: Does antibiotic prophylaxis reduce the rate of post-operative symptomatic UTI in patients undergoing each named procedure?
