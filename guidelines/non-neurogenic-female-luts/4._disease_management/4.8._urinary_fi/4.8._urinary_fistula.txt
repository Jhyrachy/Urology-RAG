4.8. Urinary fistula. The evidence relating to diagnosis and treatment of urinary fistulae is generally low level and largely composed of case series and other consensus statements. In particular, the epidemiology, aetiology, diagnosis, treatment and prevention of obstetric and non-obstetric fistulae have been described in detail during the 2016 ICI conference [668]. Most non-obstetric fistulae are iatrogenic in origin, caused by pelvic surgery (e.g., hysterectomy for benign or malignant conditions, bowel resection, and urological surgery). The risks during pelvic surgery increase proportionally to the complexity of the resection, the extent of the primary disease, and with a past history of radiotherapy (especially for recurrent disease). When a fistula occurs following radiotherapy for primary treatment, this may be an indication of tumour recurrence.
