4.13. Non-invasive tests in diagnosing bladder outlet obstruction in men with LUTS. 4.13.1. Prostatic configuration/intravesical prostatic protrusion Prostatic configuration can be evaluated with TRUS, using the concept of the presumed circle area ratio (PCAR) [116]. The PCAR evaluates how closely the transverse US image of the prostate approaches a circular shape. The ratio tends toward one as the prostate becomes more circular. The sensitivity of PCAR was 77% for diagnosing BPO when PCAR was > 0.8, with 75% specificity [116]. Ultrasound measurement of intravesical prostatic protrusion (IPP) assesses the distance between the tip of the prostate median lobe and bladder neck in the midsagittal plane, using a suprapubically positioned US scanner, with a bladder volume of 150-250 mL; grade I protrusion is 0-4.9 mm, grade II is 5-10 mm and grade III is > 10 mm. Intravesical prostatic protrusion correlates well with BOO, with a PPV of 94% and a NPV of 79% [117]. A SR examined the role of IPP in UDS determined BOO [118]. At cut-off > 10mm the sensitivity was found 0.71 and the specificity 0.77. Intravesical prostatic protrusion may also correlate with prostate volume, DO, bladder compliance, detrusor pressure at maximum urinary flow, BOO index and PVR, and negatively correlates with Qmax [119]. Furthermore, IPP also appears to successfully predict the outcome of a trial without catheter after AUR [120,121]. Evidence from the above-mentioned SR, showed that at an IPP cut-off of > 10mm, the sensitivity and specificity to predict unsuccessful voiding trial without catheter (TWOC) was 0.51 and 0.79 respectively [118]. However, no information with regards to intra- or inter-observer variability and learning curve is yet available. Therefore, whilst IPP may be a feasible option to infer BPO in men with LUTS, the role of IPP as a non-invasive alternative to PFS in the assessment of male LUTS remains under evaluation. 4.13.2. Bladder/detrusor wall thickness and ultrasound-estimated bladder weight For bladder wall thickness (BWT) assessment, the distance between the mucosa and the adventitia is measured. For detrusor wall thickness (DWT) assessment, the only measurement needed is the detrusor sandwiched between the mucosa and adventitia [122]. A correlation between BWT and UDS parameters has been reported. A threshold value of 5 mm at the anterior bladder wall with a bladder filling of 150 mL was best at differentiating between patients with or without BOO [123]. Detrusor wall thickness at the anterior bladder wall with a bladder filling > 250 mL (threshold value for BOO > 2 mm) has a PPV of 94% and a specificity of 95%, achieving 89% agreement with PFS [73]. Threshold values of 2.0, 2.5, or 2.9 mm for DWT in patients with LUTS are able to identify 81%, 89%, and 100% of patients with BOO, respectively [124]. A meta-analysis reported that DWT has high accuracy in diagnosing BOO with sensitivity 71% and specificity 88% [125]. All studies found that BWT or DWT measurements have a higher diagnostic accuracy for detecting BOO than Qmax or Qave of free uroflowmetry, measurements of PVR, prostate volume, or symptom severity. One study could not demonstrate any difference in BWT between patients with normal UDS, BOO or DO. However, the study did not use a specific bladder filling volume for measuring BWT [126]. Disadvantages of the method include the lack of standardisation, and lack of evidence to indicate which measurement (BWT/DWT) is preferable [127]. Measurement of BWT/DWT is therefore not recommended for the diagnostic work-up of men with LUTS. Ultrasound-estimated bladder weight (UEBW) may identify BOO with a diagnostic accuracy of 86% at a cut-off value of 35 g [128,129]. Severe LUTS and a high UEBW (> 35 g) are risk factors for prostate/BPO surgery in men on Î±-blockers [130]. 4.13.3. Non-invasive pressure-flow testing The penile cuff test (PCT), in which flow is interrupted to estimate isovolumetric bladder pressure, shows promising data, with good test repeatability [131] and interobserver agreement [132]. A nomogram has also been derived [133] whilst a method in which flow is not interrupted is also under investigation [134]. A SR and meta-analysis assessed the performance of PCT to recognise BOO, reported sensitivity 0.85, specificity 0.78, PPV 0.74 and NPV 0.87 [135]. However, there was marked heterogeneity among the included studies in the definition of obstruction. The data generated with the external condom method [136] correlates with invasive PFS in a high proportion of patients [137]. Resistive index [138] and prostatic urethral angle [139] have also been proposed, but are still experimental. 4.13.4. The diagnostic performance of non-invasive tests in diagnosing bladder outlet obstruction in men with LUTS compared with pressure-flow studies A SR including 42 studies investigated the diagnostic performance of non-invasive tests in diagnosing BOO in men with LUTS compared with UDS/PFS [140]. The majority of the included studies were prospective cohorts, focusing on BOO and not specifically on BPO, and the diagnostic accuracy of the following non-invasive tests were assessed: penile cuff test; uroflowmetry; DWT/BWT; bladder weight; external condom catheter method; IPP; Doppler US; prostate volume/height; and near-infrared spectroscopy. Overall, although the majority of studies have a low risk of bias, data regarding the diagnostic accuracy of these non-invasive tests is limited by the heterogeneity of the studies in terms of the threshold values used to define BOO, the different urodynamic definitions of BOO used across different studies and the small number of studies for each test. It was found that specificity, sensitivity, PPV and NPV of the non-invasive tests were highly variable. Therefore, even though several tests have shown promising results regarding non-invasive diagnosis of BOO, invasive urodynamics remains the modality of choice. The diagnostic performance of non-invasive tests could be theoretically improved when two or more tests are combined along with clinical parameters, however the evidence is still limited. Investigators have proposed a model and a clinical nomogram that uses BWT, prostate volume and PVR ratio to predict BOO with reported accuracy 0.82 [141].
