6.2.7. Summary of evidence and recommendations for the treatment of PE. Summary of evidenceLEPharmacotherapy includes either dapoxetine on-demand (an oral short-acting SSRI) and eutectic lidocaine/prilocaine spray (a topical desensitising agent), which are the only approved treatments for PE, or other off-label antidepressants (daily/on-demand SSRIs and clomipramine).1aBoth on-demand dapoxetine treatment and daily SSRI treatment improve IELT values significantly.1aBoth on-demand dapoxetine treatment and daily SSRI treatment have generally tolerable side effects when used for the treatment of PE.1aDaily/on-demand clomipramine treatments improve IELT values significantly and have generally tolerable side effects when used for the treatment of PE.1aCream and spray forms of lidocaine/prilocaine improve IELT values significantly and have safe a profile.1bTramadol is effective in the treatment of PE but the evidence is still inadequate for its long-term safety profile including addiction potential.1aCombination of PDE5Is and SSRIs overtakes SSRI monotherapy in effectiveness.1aHyaluronic acid injections are effective in decreasing penile sensitivity.2b Recommendations for assessmentStrength ratingTreat erectile dysfunction (ED), other sexual dysfunction or genitourinary infection (e.g., prostatitis) first.StrongUse either dapoxetine or the lidocaine/prilocaine spray as first-line treatments for lifelong premature ejaculation (PE).StrongUse off-label oral treatment with daily selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor (SSRIs) or daily/on-demand clomipramine as a viable alternative for second-line treatments.StrongUse off-label tramadol with caution as a viable on-demand third-line treatment alternative to on-demand/daily antidepressants (SSRIs or clomipramine).StrongUse PDE5Is alone or in combination with other therapies in patients with PE (without ED).StrongUse psychological/behavioural therapies in combination with pharmacological treatment in the management of acquired PE.WeakUse hyaluronic acid injection with caution as a treatment option for PE compared to other more established treatment modalities.WeakDo not perform dorsal neurectomy because more safety data are warranted.Weak
