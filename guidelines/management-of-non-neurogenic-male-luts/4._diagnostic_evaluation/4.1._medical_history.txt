4.1. Medical history. The importance of assessing the patient’s history is well recognised [18-20]. A medical history aims to identify the potential causes and relevant co-morbidities, including medical and neurological diseases. In addition, current medication, lifestyle habits, emotional and psychological factors must be reviewed. The Panel recognises the need to discuss LUTS and the therapeutic pathway from the patient’s perspective. This includes reassuring the patient that there is no definite link between LUTS and prostate cancer (PCa) [21,22]. As part of the urological/surgical history, a self-completed validated symptom questionnaire (see section 4.2) should be obtained to objectify and quantify LUTS [18,20]. Bladder diaries or frequency volume charts (FVC) are particularly beneficial (see section 4.3) [23]. Sexual function should also be assessed, preferably with validated symptom questionnaires such as the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) [24]. Summary of evidenceLEA medical and surgical history is an integral part of a patient’s medical evaluation.4A medical and surgical history aims to identify the potential causes of LUTS as well as any relevant co-morbidities and to review the patient’s current medication and lifestyle habits.4 RecommendationStrength ratingTake a complete medical history from men with LUTS.Strong
