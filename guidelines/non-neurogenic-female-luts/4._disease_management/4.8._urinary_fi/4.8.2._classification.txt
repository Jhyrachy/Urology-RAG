4.8.2. Classification. Due to the plethora of VVF classification systems, a consensual classification system needs to be adopted. The Waaldijk and Goh classifications are widely used for diagnosis and follow-up [688-690] but were originally designed for obstetric fistulae and their use in iatrogenic fistulae is less relevant [691]. Waaldijk’s classification is based on the size and site of the fistulae and divides them into three main categories: type 1 are VVFs with no urethral involvement; type 2 are those that involve the urethra (and are sub-classified into those with circumferential and non-circumferential urethral involvement); and type 3 are fistulae involving other parts of the urinary tract. Goh’s classification also uses the presence or absence of urethral involvement to sub-categorise VVFs and considers the degrees of fibrosis present. The WHO classification (Table 6) was originally developed for obstetric fistulae and separates fistulae into simple and complex.
