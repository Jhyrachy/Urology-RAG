5.7.5. Surgical treatment for underactive bladder. Surgical options for male patients with non-neurogenic UAB/DU include benign prostatic surgery and sacral neuromodulation [165,780-786]. 5.7.5.1. Surgery for benign prostatic obstruction A SR evaluated the outcomes of surgery for benign prostatic obstruction in men with pre-operative DU or acontractile detrusor [165]. Mean total IPSS variation following surgery was reported to range from -3 to -19.5 points. A >3 points improvement in terms of total IPSS score was evident in fourteen studies included into the SR [165]. Mean IPSS QoL score variation ranged from -0.9 to -3 points [165]. Mean maximum urinary flow (Qmax) improvement ranged from +1.4 to +11.7 mL/s. Mean PVR improvement ranged from -16.5 to -736 mL [165]. Direct comparisons between patients with DU versus without DU provided conflicting results [165]. A study found that post-operative outcomes one month after photoselective laser vaporisation prostatectomy (PVP) were worse in patients with DU compared to patients without DU [40]. In men with pre-operative DU, mean total IPSS score improved from 12.0 to 15.2, mean Qmax improved from 4.8 ml/sec to 8.2 ml/sec, and mean PVR improved from 918.3 mL to 325.9 mL. In patients without pre-operative DU mean total IPSS improved from 17.5 to 9.7, mean Qmax improved from 6.9 ml/sec to 17.6 ml/sec, and mean PVR improved from 225.0 mL to 99.2 mL [783]. A statistically significant difference (p ≤ 0.05) was observed in terms of mean IPSS, mean Qmax, and mean PVR when comparing patients with and without pre-operative DU at one month follow-up [783]. Similarly, another study found that patients with DU had smaller decrease in terms of median total IPSS (-6.5 vs. -11) and a smaller increase in the Qmax (+3.5 mL/s vs. +8.2 mL/s) after PVP than did those without DU [782]. In details, in men with DU median total IPSS score improved from 17.5 to 9.5, median Qmax improved from 9.7 ml/sec to 13.8 ml/sec and median PVR improved from 28 mL to 11.5 mL. In patients without pre-operative DU median IPSS improved from 20.5 to 8, median Qmax improved from 10 ml/sec to 17.9 ml/sec, and median PVR improved from 27.5 mL to 9 mL [782]. Statistical analysis found a significant differences between the two groups at follow-up evaluations only in terms of Qmax (p: 0.023). Other authors failed to find differences in terms of symptom improvement and success rates between patients with and without pre-operative DU [165]. Mean Bladder Contractility Index (BCI) improvement was reported to range from 4 to 44.6 [165]. A retrospective study found that 81.7% of patients with DU or acontractile detrusor undergoing TURP or TUIP achieved a satisfactory treatment outcome defined as improved QoL and voiding efficiency of >50% [784]. Among these patients, mean BCI significantly increased from 16.4 to 61.0 and 69.4% of them had recovery of detrusor function within 3 months [784]. A prospective case series found that 78% of patients with DU or acontractile detrusor and concurrent BPO undergoing holmium laser enucleation of the prostate exhibited significant return of bladder contractility, determined by the presence of a sustained, volitional detrusor contraction at six months follow-up [785]. Of note, 94.7% of patients were voiding spontaneously with acceptable PVR volume, whereas 5.3% required CIC post-operatively [785]. Factors influencing the surgical outcomes have been investigated: older age, lack of obstruction, concomitant detrusor overactivity, lower detrusor contractility and use of transurethral resection of the prostate or photovaporisation instead of holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP) were associated with worse outcomes [165]. A retrospectively investigated the effect of DU on the efficacy of TURP by comparing the subjective and objective parameters preoperatively and three months post-operatively between severe (BCI < 82), mild (82 ≤ BCI < 100), and absent DU (BCI ≥ 100) in two obstruction groups (20 ≤ Bladder Outlet Obstruction Index (BOOI) < 40 and BOOI ≥ 40) [786]. Successful improvement after the operation were defined according to the criteria developed by Homma et al. [786]. In patients with pre-operative BOOI ≥ 40 the successful improvement rates for the IPSS, IPSS-Storage, IPSS-Voiding, QoL and free Qmax were 60.6%, 54.5%, 54.5%, 63.6% and 66.6% in patients with severe DU. The same figures in patients with BOOI ≥ 40 and mild DU were: 87.7%, 63.2%, 94.7%, 75.4%, and 75.4%, respectively. Finally, in patients with BOOI ≥ 40 and absent DU the successful improvement rates were 94.1%, 82.8%, 95.6%, 90.6%, and 71.4%, respectively. In the 20 ≤ BOOI < 40 group, the successful improvement rates for the IPSS, IPSS-Storage, IPSS-Voiding, QoL and free Qmax in the severe DU patients were only 38.2%, 38.2%, 44.1%, 41.2% and 38.2%, respectively. The same figures in patients with mild DU were: 83.3%, 66.7%, 83.3%, 75.0%, and 41.7%, respectively. Finally, in patients with absent DU the successful improvement rates were 90.9%, 90.9%, 90.9%, 90.9%, and 81.8%, respectively. Therefore, patients with varying degrees of benign prostate obstruction can benefit from TURP, but for patients with severe DU in the 20 ≤ BOOI < 40 group, TURP should be carefully considered only after adequate counselling [786]. Unfortunately, the few long-term data available seem to reveal poor durability of benefits [165]. 5.7.5.2. Sacral neuromodulation Sacral neuromodulation (SNM) has been reported to improve idiopathic urinary retention in women in long-term studies [787]. However, only scarce evidence exists in men with DU or acontractile detrusor. A multicentric, retrospective case series reported the outcomes of SNS in adults with a urodynamic‐based diagnosis of DU and symptom duration of more than six months who failed to respond to first and second‐line treatment options [781]. Patients with cognitive disabilities, BOO and those who had any contraindication for SNS were excluded. Overall, 35 males were included. Of these, 51.4% responded to the first stage and were candidates for the full implant. Overall, 72% of male patients had favourable responses after the full implantation. Voided volume, PVR, and the median Qmax improved in both sexes [781]. In men who underwent full implantation voided volume improved from 75.0 mL to 300.0 mL, PVR improved from 350.0 mL to 90.0 mL, and mean Qmax improved from 7.0 to mL/sec to 16.0 mL/sec. Evidence from another retrospective study suggests that residual detrusor contractility is more likely to respond to a trial of SNM compared to detrusor acontractility [788]. Summary of evidenceLEIn patients with DU or acontractile detrusor and concomitant benign prostatic obstruction, de-obstruction procedures are associated with improvements in bladder contractility index, mean total International Prostate Symptom Score, mean maximum urinary flow, and mean postvoid residual volume.3Older age, lack of bladder outflow obstruction, concomitant detrusor overactivity, lower bladder contractility and use of transurethral resection of the prostate or photo vaporisation instead of laser enucleation of the prostate are associated with worse post-operative outcomes after de-obstruction procedures.3Sacral neuromodulation provides statistically significant improvement in terms of voided volume, post-void residual, and median maximum flow rate in men with refractory DU and no BPO.3 RecommendationsStrength ratingCounsel patients with evidence of detrusor underactivity (DU) or acontractile detrusor and concomitant benign prostatic enlargement about the potential subjective and objective benefits of benign prostatic surgery.WeakOffer men with DU and no benign prostatic obstruction, test phase sacral neuromodulation.Weak
