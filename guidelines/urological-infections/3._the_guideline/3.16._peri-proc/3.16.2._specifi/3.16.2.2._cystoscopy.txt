3.16.2.2. Cystoscopy. Three systematic reviews and meta-analyses [531-533] and one additional RCT [534] on cystoscopy for stent removal were identified. Garcia-Perdomo et al., included seven RCTs with a total of 3,038 participants. The outcome of symptomatic UTI was measured by five trials of moderate overall quality and meta-analysis showed a benefit for using antibiotic prophylaxis [RR (95%CI) 0.53 (0.31 – 0.90)]; ARR 1.3% (from 2.8% to 1.5%) with a NNT of 74 [532]. This benefit was not seen if only the two trials with low risk of bias were used in the meta-analysis. Carey et al., included seven RCTs with 5,107 participants. Six trials were included in meta-analysis of the outcome of symptomatic bacteriuria which found benefit for use of antibiotic prophylaxis [RR (95%CI) 0.34 (0.27 – 0.47)]; ARR 3.4% (from 6% to 2.6%) with NNT of 28 [531]. Zeng et al., included twenty RCTs and two quasi-RCTs with a total of 7,711 participants. The outcome of symptomatic UTI was measured by eleven RCTs of low overall quality and meta-analysis showed a possible benefit for using antibiotic prophylaxis [RR (95% CI) 0.49 (0.28 – 0.86)] [533]. For systemic UTI, antibiotic prophylaxis showed no effect compared with placebo or no treatment in five RCTs [RR (95% CI) 1.12 (0.38 - 3.32)]. However, prophylactic antibiotics may increase bacterial resistance [(RR (95% CI) 1.73 (1.04 – 2.87)]. Given the low absolute risk of post-procedural UTI in well-resourced countries, the high number of procedures being performed, and the high risk of contributing to increasing antimicrobial resistance the panel consensus was to strongly recommend not to use antibiotic prophylaxis in patients undergoing urethrocystoscopy (flexible or rigid).
