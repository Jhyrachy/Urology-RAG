5.3.2.2. bipolar transurethral enucleation prostate. mechanism action: following principles bipolar technology (section 5.3.1.1), obstructive adenoma enucleated endoscopically transurethral approach. currently, two technologies exist, namely plasmakinetic (pk) enucleation prostate (pkep) bipolar plasma enucleation prostate (bpep) . bipolar transurethral enucleation prostate followed either morcellation resection [383,386-390] enucleated adenoma. efficacy: two meta-analyses, reported similar efficacy twelve months terms ipss, qol score qmax b-tuep (pkep bpep) vs. b-turp . another meta-analysis evaluating b-tuep vs. b-turp, reported similar efficacy 36 months terms ipss, qmax . one rct evaluating pkep vs. m-turp reported significant improvement ipss, qol score, qmax, urodynamically proven de-obstruction favouring pkep 36-months follow-up . one rct evaluating pkep vs. b-turp patients prostate volume > 80 ml reported clinically relevant differences ipss, qol score, qmax, six months follow . another rct evaluating bpep vs. b-turp patients prostate volume > 80 ml reported clinically relevant differences ipss, qol score, qmax pvr 24-months follow-up  two rcts evaluated mid-term efficacy pkep vs. b-turp 36 months one rct evaluated long-term efficacy 60 months . efficacy significantly better pkep patients large prostates 36, 48 60 months . comparative data efficacy b-tuep vs. op various forms laser enucleation presented section 5.3.2.1 – 5.3.2.5, respectively. tolerability safety: two meta-analyses evaluating b-tuep vs. b-turp reported similar operation, catheterisation hospitalisation times; lower acute urine retention rates; significantly reduced haemoglobin drop blood transfusion rates; difference ed; difference reported complication rates including urethral stricture/bnc rates b-tuep 24-months follow-up . . meta-analyses evaluating pkep vs. turp reported mid-term iief-5 scores comparable . another meta-analyses reported less bleeding b-tuep compared m-turp similar ui rates aur catheter removal . rct evaluating pkep vs. m-turp patients prostate volume < 80 ml 36-month follow-up reported pkep superior m-turp terms catheterisation, hospitalisation time . significant differences arms reported operation time, blood transfusion rates, sexual function, reported complications (tur-syndrome, clot retention, incontinence, retrograde ejaculation, urethral structures/bnc) . one rct evaluating pkep vs. b-turp patients’ prostate volume > 80 ml six months follow-up reported pkep superior b-turp terms operation, catheterisation hospitalisation time . significant differences reported blood transfusion, bnc retrograde ejaculation rates favouring pkep, differences urethral stricture ed rates reported another rct evaluating bpep vs. b-turp patients prostate volume > 80 ml reported bpep longer operative time shorter catheterisation, hospitalisation time differences blood transfusion, urethral stricture ui rates 24-months follow-up . difference urethral stricture/bnc rates reported 60 months follow-up . comparative data efficacy b-tuep vs. op various forms laser enucleation presented section 5.3.2.1 – 5.3.2.5, respectively. summary evidencelebipolar transurethral pkep shows favourable mid- long-term efficacy compared turp.1bbipolar transurethral pkep favourable peri-operative safety profile demonstrates similar mid- long-term safety compared turp.1b recommendationstrength ratingoffer bipolar transurethral (plasmakinetic) enucleation prostate men moderate-to-severe luts alternative transurethral resection prostate.weak
