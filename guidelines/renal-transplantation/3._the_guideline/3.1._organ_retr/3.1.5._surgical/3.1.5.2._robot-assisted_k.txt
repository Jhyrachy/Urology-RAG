3.1.5.2. Robot-assisted kidney transplant surgery. Robot-assisted kidney transplant (RAKT) surgery using living donor kidneys have now been evaluated in multi-centre prospective non-randomised studies (using IDEAL consortium principles) [125]. Single centre prospective non-randomised studies are on-going addressing RAKT with use of deceased donor kidneys. Both trans-peritoneal and extra-peritoneal approaches for RAKT are described. Potential advantages of RAKT may exist (decreased post-operative pain, incision length and lymphocele rate). Potential issues with RAKT are the exclusion of recipients with severe atherosclerosis or third (or further) kidney transplants, a higher than expected rate of DGF and a small number of reported early arterial thromboses despite carefully selected cases [126]. The learning curve for RAKT has been reported to be 35 cases for experienced surgeons in a retrospective multicentre series of 187 patients undergoing RAKT [127]. Complication and DGF rates decreased significantly and plateaued after the first 20 cases. The rate of Clavien- Dindo grade III/IV complications was 14% during the first ten RAKTs, but only 3% after this [127]. The rate of arterial graft thrombosis (1.6%) was comparable with that for open kidney transplant (0.5 - 3.5%) [127]. A ten year single-centre retrospective analysis of 239 obese RAKT patients concluded that RAKT can be safely performed in obese patients with minimal risk of developing a surgical site infection [128]. A graft failure rate of 7.1% was reported during follow up mostly due to acute rejection. Patient and graft survival was 95% and 93% at three years, respectively [128]. Evidence is too premature to recommend RAKT outside of appropriately mentored prospective studies.
