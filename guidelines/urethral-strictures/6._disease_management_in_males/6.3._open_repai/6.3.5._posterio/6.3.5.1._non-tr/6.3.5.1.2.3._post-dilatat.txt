6.3.5.1.2.3. Post-dilatation/direct vision internal urethrotomy strategies for non-traumatic posterior urethral Stenosis. 6.3.5.1.2.3.1.Intermittent self-dilatation for non-traumatic posterior urethral stenosis As for anterior strictures, ISD can be offered to patients for recurrent posterior stenosis after dilation/DVIU to stabilise the stenosis. This is especially relevant for patients unfit/unwilling to undergo surgery or in patients with radiation-induced BMS [117,376,381,403]. Although ISD may be acceptable to many urologists and patients, it usually is associated with a reduced QoL and poor patient compliance [33]. 6.3.5.1.2.3.2.Intralesional injections for non-traumatic posterior urethral stenosis In order to stabilise the luminal fibrosis and consequently to reduce the risk of recurrence, injection of antifibrotic agents at the time of endoluminal treatment has been proposed. The majority of patients in these studies were patients with recalcitrant/recurrent non-obliterative VUAS/BNS. Two series used corticosteroids [379,396], whilst the others used MMC [397,401-405]. Patency rates with corticosteroid injections range between 50-100% [379,396]. Patency rates with MMC vary between 50-94% [397,404-406]. No trials comparing endoluminal treatment with or without adjuvant intralesional injections were identified. See supplementary Table S6.13 for further information. Complications are low across most studies, but all studies were retrospective in nature. Redshaw et al., also reported grade 3 complications in four out of 55 (7%) patients, including osteitis pubis (n=2), bladder neck necrosis (n=1) and rectourethral fistula (n=1) in one multi-institutional study [404]. Three of these patients ultimately required urinary diversion with additional faecal diversion in one patient [404]. Given the severity of these complications, although rare, MMC should not be used outside the framework of a clinical trial [407]. 6.3.5.1.2.3.3.Urethral stent for non-traumatic posterior urethral stenosis Stents have been used anecdotally in the posterior urethra [247,248,376]. Patency rates are relatively low (47-60%) [247,248,376] at the cost of a high-risk for UI (19-82%) [247,248]. Summary of evidenceLEFor non-obliterative VUAS and radiation-induced BMS, visually controlled dilatation and DVIU yield a patency rate of respectively 0-89% and 25-100% with a low complication rate. It can be performed under loco-regional anaesthesia.3During DVIU, deep incision might provoke injury to the rectum at the six o’ clock position and might provoke uro-symphyseal fistulation at the twelve o’clock position.3For BNS, TUR and “hot-knife” incision yield a patency rate of respectively 58.3 and 72% with a low complication rate.3Repeat endoluminal treatments in non-obliterative VUAS, radiation-induced BMS or BNS can stabilise the posterior stenosis and are easy to perform compared to reconstructive surgery.3Any form of endoluminal treatment might be associated with de novo UI (up to 25%) or worsening of existing UI (up to 15%).3Vesico-urethral anastomosis stricture, BMS and BNS with complete obliteration are not included in present series and endoluminal treatment is unlikely to be successful.3Urethral stents at the posterior urethra have a rather low patency rate (47-60%) and incontinence rate (19-82%).3 RecommendationsStrength ratingPerform visually controlled dilatation or direct vision internal urethrotomy (DVIU) as 1st line-treatment for a non-obliterative vesico-urethral anastomosis stricture (VUAS) or radiation-induced bulbomembranous strictures (BMS).WeakDo not perform deep incisions at the six and twelve o’ clock position during DVIU for VUAS or radiation-induced BMS.StrongPerform transurethral resection (TUR) or “hot-knife” DVIU as 1st line-treatment for patients with non-obliterative bladder neck stenosis (BNS) after surgery for benign prostatic obstruction.StrongPerform repeat endoluminal treatments in non-obliterative VUAS or BNS in an attempt to stabilise the stricture.WeakWarn patients about the risk of de novo urinary incontinence (UI) or exacerbation of existing UI after endoluminal treatment.WeakDo not perform endoluminal treatment in case of VUAS, BMS and BNS with complete obliteration.StrongDo not use stents for strictures at the posterior urethra.Weak
