6.2.2. Metastatic disease (stage IIA/B). 6.2.2.1. Stage IIA/B seminoma Patients with enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes < 2 cm in greatest diameter and normal markers may be observed for six to eight weeks with repeat-staging imaging as these may be non-metastatic on average in 10% of cases. Treatment should only be initiated if metastatic disease is unequivocal, based on biopsy, increasing nodal size/number, or subsequent marker rise [46,150]. A special case are those patients who can undergo primary RPLND within a trial or institutional study (see below for further details). Historically, radiotherapy has been the primary treatment for stage II A/B seminoma, showing relapse rates between 9-24% [152,153]. Recommended radiation doses for stage IIA and IIB are 30 Gy and 36 Gy, respectively. With these doses, five-year relapse-free survival rates stand at 92% for stage IIA and 90% for IIB [152,153]. A reduced dose of 27 Gy for stage IIA has been associated with a higher relapse rate [105]. Chemotherapy is a standard option for stage IIA/B seminoma, with relapse rates of 0-8% for stage IIA disease and 8-14% for stage IIB disease, and an excellent overall survival of 99% [154,155]. The standard regimen in stage II seminoma is BEP x 3 (see Appendix 4.1.2) or EPx4 if there are concerns with the use of bleomycin [156]. There are no randomised studies comparing radiotherapy and chemotherapy. A meta-analysis of thirteen high-quality studies, comparing efficacy and toxicity of radiotherapy and chemotherapy showed that these appeared similarly effective in both stage IIA/IIB patients although with a non-significant trend towards greater efficacy for chemotherapy (HR: 2.17) in stage IIB seminoma [154]. Acute toxicity was almost exclusively reported following chemotherapy, while long-term toxicity was more frequent following radiotherapy, mainly comprising bowel toxicity and secondary cancers, generally in the irradiated field [154]. Several series have shown an increased risk of developing a second solid cancer of 1.8-2.0-fold with radiotherapy [157]. Long term toxicities of chemotherapy including second cancers are also a concern [157]. 6.2.2.1.1. Retroperitoneal lymph node dissection Several institutional series and a few single-arm phase II studies have explored primary RPLND with or without adjuvant chemotherapy as an alternative to chemotherapy in men with low volume CS II A/B [158-162]. Differences in surgical technique/template, extent of use of adjuvant chemotherapy, patient selection, and length of follow-up make direct comparisons of these surgical series to chemotherapy difficult. In these reports, patients with low-volume CS II A/B seminoma had two-year recurrence rates of 5-30%, with immature OS outcomes owing to short follow-up. Relapse will almost always be cured by standard chemotherapy. Longer follow-up and ideally, comparative prospective studies are required to ensure this can be recommended as a safe stand-alone treatment option equivalent to chemotherapy alone. Primary RPLND for men with low volume CS II seminoma should only be performed by surgeons with extensive experience in specialised TC centres. Ideally, the procedure should take place within a prospective cohort or clinical trial in order to maintain surgical quality and monitor long-term oncological outcomes. 6.2.2.1.2. De-escalating approaches Several trials attempted to de-escalate chemotherapy and RT, aiming at maintaining the traditional excellent oncologic result, while minimising treatment burden and toxicity. Such an approach was evaluated in a phase II randomised trial, assessing chemotherapy de-escalation in patients guided by metabolic response on FDG-PET/CT after two initial cycles of etoposide, cisplatin (EP) chemotherapy [163]. Patients with complete metabolic response after EP x 2 received de-escalated treatment with one subsequent cycle of carboplatin AUC7, whilst patients with residual metabolic activity completed the initial schedule of EP x 4. The study showed comparable three-year PFS rate of 90% and 91% for the EP and carboplatin groups respectively, and a two-year OS of 100% for both groups. Despite the apparently maintained oncological efficacy, larger studies and longer follow-up is needed. For these reasons and owing to the absence of consensus criteria for FDG-PETC/CT interpretation, making treatment decisions based solely on FDG-PET/CT responses is not currently recommended for routine use [163]. Another de-escalation option emerged, involving one cycle of carboplatin followed by involved-node (small-volume) radiotherapy (30 Gy in 15 sessions for stage IIA and 36 Gy in 18 sessions for stage IIB). This approach has shown a three-year progression-free survival rate of 93.7% in a single-arm phase II trial, narrowly missing its target primary endpoint of 95% three-year PFS [164]. Currently such approaches lack the level of evidence needed for routine use recommendation. Summary of evidenceLEAt this stage all de-escalation strategies, including RPLND remain under evaluation and should only be considered in high volume specialised centres within a prospective cohort or clinical trial.3 Figure 2: Treatment options in patients with seminoma clinical stage IIA and B* *when enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes are < 2 cm and with normal markers, treatment should not be initiated unless metastatic disease is unequivocal based on biopsy, increasing nodal size/number, or subsequent marker rise.BEP = cisplatin, etoposide, bleomycin; EP = etoposide, cisplatin. 6.2.2.2. Stage II A/B non-seminoma (NSGCT) 6.2.2.2.1. Serum tumour marker negative Patients with normal markers and equivocal lymph nodes (< 2 cm) may be considered for initial surveillance with early re-evaluation at six weeks. If the lesion progresses or fails to resolve it should be regarded and treated as CS II. With CS IIA NSGCT disease and normal or normalised tumour markers, nerve sparing RPLND performed by an experienced surgeon in a specialised centre is the recommended initial treatment. Patients may be down staged to PS I in up to 20% of cases and require no further treatment. Patients with post-pubertal teratoma alone will avoid unnecessary chemotherapy as surgery alone is curative. The oncological outcomes after RPLND in CS II NSGCT have been evaluated in a SR [165]. Of the included studies the majority were retrospective with included patients differing substantially in histopathology, size and number of retroperitoneal lymph nodes resected, surgical templates, and the use of adjuvant chemotherapy. In men with marker negative CS II NSGCT, PS II is confirmed in 80%. Without adjuvant chemotherapy 12-40% recurred compared to 0-4% in those who received adjuvant chemotherapy. These findings align with large single centre reports of outcomes following RPLND alone for PS II NSGCT with active disease [116,123,124,166]. These studies reported five-year relapse of less than 30%, with the majority occurring outside the retroperitoneum requiring systemic chemotherapy according to risk group. Adjuvant chemotherapy may be discussed with the patient to reduce the risk of relapse in this setting. Key issues include risk factors for relapse (as positive lymph node-ratio), the risk of overtreatment in up to 70% of cases and the need for rigorous follow-up. When adjuvant chemotherapy is chosen, standard treatment is BEP or EP for a maximum of two cycles [165,167]. A recent single institution real world study including 61 CS IIA/B < 3cm NSGCT (out of 66 GCT) with active disease, showed a 77% two-year progression-free survival without adjuvant chemotherapy in stage IIA/B < 3 cm, with the greatest benefit was achieved in stage IIA marker negative cases [166].

Serum tumour marker positive Patients with elevated tumor markers and radiological stage IIA/B at diagnosis or relapse should be treated with chemotherapy as outlined in tables 6 and 7 and section 6.2.3.1 based on IGCCCG risk group. Most patients will have a good prognosis for whom BEPX3 is most appropriate or EP x 4 if there are concerns with the use of bleomycin. Primary RPLND for CS IIA/B disease with elevated markers is not recommended outside a specific study in a referral centre [166,168].
