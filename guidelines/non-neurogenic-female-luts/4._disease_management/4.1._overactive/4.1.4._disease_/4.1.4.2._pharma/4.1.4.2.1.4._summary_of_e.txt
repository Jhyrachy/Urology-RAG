4.1.4.2.1.4. Summary of evidence and recommendations for anticholinergic drugs. Summary of evidenceLEAnticholinergic drugs are effective in improving OAB symptoms, decreasing UUI episodes, decreasing daily urgency and frequency episodes and increasing mean voided volumes, compared with placebo.1aAnticholinergic drugs caused higher adverse events than placebo including dry mouth, cognitive impairment, and constipation.1aOnce daily (ER) formulations are associated with lower rates of adverse events compared to IR preparations.1bTransdermal oxybutynin is associated with lower rates of dry mouth than oral anticholinergic drugs but has a higher rate of withdrawal due to skin reactions.1bHigher doses of anticholinergic drugs are more effective to improve OAB symptoms but exhibit a higher risk of adverse effects.1aNo anticholinergic drug is clearly superior to another for cure or improvement of OAB/UUI.1aThe combination of antimuscarinics plus another treatment modality was more effective than antimuscarinics alone in improving OAB.1aAdherence to anticholinergic treatment is low and decreases over time because of lack of efficacy, adverse events and/or cost.2aMost patients will stop anticholinergic agents within the first three months.2a RecommendationsStrength ratingOffer anticholinergic drugs to woman with overactive bladder (OAB) who fail conservative treatment.StrongConsider extended-release formulations of anticholinergic drugs whenever possible.StrongIf an anticholinergic treatment proves ineffective, consider dose escalation, offering an alternative anticholinergic formulation, or the use of mirabegron (alone or in combination with an anticholinergic).StrongEncourage early review (of efficacy and adverse effects) of patients on anticholinergic medication for OAB.Strong
