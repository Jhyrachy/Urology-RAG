3.4.3. Medical expulsive therapy. Several drug classes including α-blockers, calcium channel inhibitors, and phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDEI-5) are used for MET [117-120] A class effect of α-blockers in MET has been demonstrated in MAs although this is an off-label indication [121-123]. However, there is contradictory evidence between these studies and several well-designed, multicentre, placebo-controlled, double-blinded randomised studies showing limited, or no, benefit using α-blockers, besides some advantage for distal ureteral stones > 5 mm [124-128]. Based on studies with a limited number of patients [120,121,129,130], no recommendation for the use of PDEI-5 or corticosteroids in combination with α-blockers in MET can be made. The panel concludes that MET using α-blockers seems efficacious in the treatment of patients with distal ureteral stones > 5 mm who are amenable to conservative management. Medical expulsive therapy in special situations is addressed in the relevant chapters. 3.4.3.1. Summary of evidence and recommendations for medical expulsive therapy Summary of evidenceLEMedical expulsive therapy seems to be efficacious for treating patients with ureteral stones who are amenable to conservative management. The greatest benefit might be among those with > 5 mm (distal) ureteral stones.1aInsufficient data exist to support the use of PDEI-5 or corticosteroids in combination with α-blockers as an accelerating adjunct.2aAlpha-blockers increase stone expulsion rates in distal ureteral stones > 5 mm.1aA class effect of α-blockers has been demonstrated.1a RecommendationStrength ratingOffer α-blockers as medical expulsive therapy as one of the treatment options for (distal) ureteral stones > 5 mm.*Strong * Alpha-blockers are an off-label treatment
