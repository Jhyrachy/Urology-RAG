8.1. introduction. surveillance treatment rcc allows urologist monitor identify: post-operative complications;renal function;local recurrence;recurrence contralateral kidney;distant metastases;cardiovascular events. consensus follow-up strategies rcc treatment, limited evidence suggesting frequent post-operative imaging intervals provide improvement early detection recurrence would lead improved survival . such, intensive radiological surveillance may necessary patients. follow-up also important assess functional outcomes limit long-term sequelae renal function impairment, esrd cardiovascular events . currently, key question whether recurrence detection follow-up subsequent treatment lead meaningful change survival outcome patients. contrast high-grade and/or locally-advanced disease, outcome surgery t1a low-grade tumours almost always excellent. therefore reasonable stratify follow-up, taking account risk different rcc develop local distant recurrence. although randomised evidence, large studies examined prognostic factors long follow-up (le: 4). one study shown survival benefit patients followed within structured surveillance protocol vs. patients ; patients undergoing follow-up seem longer os compared patients undergoing routine follow-up . furthermore, individualised risk-based approach rcc follow-up recently proposed. authors used competing risk models, incorporating patient age, pathologic stage, relapse location comorbidities, calculate risk non-rcc death exceeds risk rcc recurrence . patients low-stage disease charlson comorbidity index > 2, risk non-rcc death exceeded abdominal recurrence risk already one month surgery, regardless patient age. pshylogical factors, sr including 15 studies revealed psychological distress (defined anxiety, depression, psychological distress time treatment follow-up) also prevalent among renal cell carcinoma (rcc) patients, reaching 77% non-metastatic cases . recur consortium, initiated panel, collects similar data aim provide comparators guideline recommendations. recently published recur data support risk-based approach; specifically competing-risk analysis showed low-risk patients, risk non-rcc related death exceeded risk rcc recurrence shortly initial surgery. intermediate-risk patients, corresponding time point reached around four five years surgery. high-risk patients, risk rcc recurrence continuously exceeded risk non-rcc related death . near future, genetic profiling may refine existing prognostic scores external validation datasets adjuvant trials promising improving stratification patientâ€™s risk recurrence . recurrence pn rare, early diagnosis relevant, effective treatment surgery . recurrence contralateral kidney rare (1-2%) occur late (median 5-6 years) (le: 3). follow-up identify local recurrences metastases early stage. recurrence, extensive metastatic tumour growth hinder opportunity surgical resection. addition, early diagnosis tumour recurrence may enhance efficacy systemic treatment tumour burden low.
