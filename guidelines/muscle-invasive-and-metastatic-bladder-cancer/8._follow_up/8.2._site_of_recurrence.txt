8.2. Site of recurrence. 8.2.1. Local recurrence Local recurrence takes place in the soft tissues of the original surgical site or in LNs. Contemporary cystectomy has a 5–15% probability of pelvic recurrence which usually occurs during the first 24 months, most often within 6 to 18 months after surgery. However, late recurrences can occur up to five years after RC. Risk factors described are pathological stage, LNs, positive margins, extent of LND and peri-operative chemotherapy [577]. Patients generally have a poor prognosis after pelvic recurrence. Even with treatment, median survival ranges from four to eight months following diagnosis. Definitive therapy can prolong survival, but mostly provides significant palliation of symptoms. Trimodality management generally involves a combination of chemotherapy, radiation and surgery [576]. 8.2.2. Distant recurrence Distant recurrence is seen in up to 50% of patients treated with RC for MIBC. As with local recurrence, pathological stage and nodal involvement are risk factors [578]. Systemic recurrence is more common in locally-advanced disease (pT3/4), ranging from 32 to 62%, and in patients with LN involvement (range 52–70%) [579]. The most likely sites for distant recurrence are LNs, lungs, liver and bone. Nearly 90% of distant recurrences appear within the first three years after RC, mainly in the first two years, although late recurrence has been described after more than 10 years. Median survival of patients with progressive disease treated with platinum-based chemotherapy is 9–26 months [580-582]. However, longer survival (28–33% at 5 years) has been reported in patients with minimal metastatic disease undergoing TMT management, including metastasectomy [324,583]. 8.2.3. Urothelial recurrences After RC, the incidence of new urethral tumours was 4.4% (1.3–13.7%). Risk factors for secondary urethral tumours are urethral malignancy in the prostatic urethra/prostate (in men) and bladder neck (in women). Orthotopic neobladder was associated with a significant lower risk of urethral tumours after RC (OR: 0.44) [584]. There is limited data, and agreement, about urethral follow-up, with some authors recommending routine surveillance with urethral wash and urine cytology and others doubting the need for routine urethral surveillance. However, there is a significant survival advantage in men with urethral recurrence diagnosed asymptomatically vs. symptomatically, so follow-up of the male urethra is indicated in patients at risk of urethral recurrence [576]. Treatment is influenced by local stage and grade of urethral occurrence. In urethral CIS, BCG instillations have success rates of 83% [585]. In invasive disease, urethrectomy should be performed if the urethra is the only site of disease; in case of distant disease, systemic chemotherapy is indicated [3]. Upper urinary tract UCs occur in 4–10% of cases and represent the most common sites of late recurrence (3-year DFS following RC) [586]. Median OS is 10–55 months, and 60–67% of patients die of metastatic disease [576]. A meta-analysis found that 38% of UTUC recurrence was diagnosed by follow-up investigations, whereas in the remaining 62%, diagnosis was based on symptoms. When urine cytology was used during surveillance, the rate of primary detection was 7% vs. 29.6% with UUT imaging. The meta-analysis concluded that patients with non-invasive cancer are twice as likely to have UTUC as patients with invasive disease [587]. Multifocality increases the risk of recurrence by three-fold, while positive ureteral or urethral margins increase the risk by seven-fold. Radical nephroureterectomy can prolong survival [588].
