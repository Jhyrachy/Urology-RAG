6.2.2.3.4. Prostatic anterior fat pad dissection and histologic analysis. Several multi-centre and large single-centre series have shown the presence of lymphoid tissue within the fat pad anterior to the endopelvic fascia; the prostatic anterior fat pad (PAFP) [546-552]. This lymphoid tissue is present in 5.5â€“10.6% of cases and contains metastatic PCa in up to 1.3% of intermediate- and high-risk patients. When positive, the PAFP is often the only site of LN metastasis. The PAFP is therefore a rare but recognised route of spread of disease. The PAFP is always removed at RP for exposure of the endopelvic fascia and should be sent for histologic analysis as per all removed tissue.
