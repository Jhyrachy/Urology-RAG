4.9. Cystine stones. Cystine stones account for 1-2% of all urinary stones in adults and 6-8% of the stones reported in paediatric studies [678,679]. All cystine stone formers are deemed at high risk of recurrence and CKD [680,681]. 4.9.1. Diagnosis Blood analysis includes measurement of creatinine, and urinalysis includes measurement of urine volume, pH profile, specific weight, and cystine. Since the disease may be asymptomatic, siblings of cystinuric patients should be investigated for cystinuria [682]. Interpretation Cystine is poorly soluble in urine and crystallises spontaneously within the physiological urinary pH range.Cystine solubility depends strongly on urine pH: at pH 6.0, the limit of solubility is 1.33 mmol/L.Routine analysis of cystine is not suitable for therapeutic monitoring.Regardless of the phenotype or genotype of the cystinuric patient, the clinical manifestations are the same [683].There is no role for genotyping patients in the routine management of cystinuria [684,685].Reductive therapy targets the disulphide binding in the cystine molecule. For therapy monitoring, it is important to differentiate between cystine, cysteine, and drug-cysteine complexes. However, available methods to monitor cystinuria treatment which may be able to differentiate between the different complexes formed by therapy are cumbersome [686,687] non accurate, including high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) [63].Quantitative 24-hour urinary cystine excretion confirms the diagnosis in the absence of stone analysis.Levels above 0.125 mmol/day (30 mg/day) are considered abnormal [688,689]. 4.9.2. Specific treatment General preventative measures for fluid intake and diet are recommended. A diet low in methionine may theoretically reduce urinary excretion of cystine; however, patients are unlikely to comply sufficiently with such a diet. A restricted intake of sodium is more easily achieved and is more effective in reducing urinary cystine. Patients are usually advised to avoid sodium consumption > 2 g/day (5 g NaCl) [690]. A high level of diuresis is of fundamental importance, aiming for a 24-hour urine volume of > 3 L [683,690-692]. A considerable fluid intake evenly distributed throughout the day is necessary. 4.9.2.1. Pharmacological treatment of cystine stones The main therapeutic option for avoiding cystine crystallisation is to maintain urine pH > 7.5, to improve cysteine solubility, and ensure appropriate hydration with a minimum of >3 L/day in adults, or 1.5 L/m2 body surface area in children [683,690-692]. Home monitoring of the urine pH is suggested because of the possibility of self-adjusting alkaline treatment keeping the urine pH within range [63]. Free cystine concentration can be decreased by reductive substances, which act by splitting the disulphide binding of cystine. Tiopronin is currently the best choice for cystine reduction. However, side effects often lead to treatment termination, for example when nephrotic syndrome develops or when there is poor compliance, especially with long-term use. After carefully considering the risk of early tachyphylaxis, putting into place a dose-escape phenomenon for long-term use, and recurrence risk, tiopronin is recommended at cystine levels > 3.0 mmol/day (720 mg/day) or in the case of recurring stone formation, notwithstanding other preventive measures [683,690-692]. Spot measurement of urine protein should be performed at baseline and during follow-up. Figure 4.9: Metabolic management of cystine stonesÂ [693] 4.9.3.
