4.5.2. Epidemiology, aetiology, pathophysiology. 4.5.2.1. Epidemiology Estimates of prevalence of BOO among women vary from 2.7-29% [504]. One large series of women undergoing urodynamic evaluation for LUTS found that ~20% are diagnosed with BOO. The wide variance is due to several factors, including differences in definitions and diagnostic criteria for female BOO, differences in study populations, and variation in study methods. The estimated prevalence rates of LUTS due to BOO in women are lower than those reported in men (18.7–18.9% vs. 24.3–24.7%) [505]. Prevalence of voiding LUTS is associated with age [54,506,507], parity [54,508], prolapse [54,508] and prior continence surgery [54,508]. Bladder outlet obstruction has long been postulated to cause mainly voiding symptoms [509] but recent data from a series of 1,142 women referred for evaluation of LUTS suggest that storage symptoms may be predominant in women diagnosed with BOO, and excess daytime urinary frequency was the most common symptom reported by 69% [504]. 4.5.2.2. Pathophysiology Bladder outlet obstruction can be either anatomical (mechanical) or functional. In anatomical BOO, there is a physical or mechanical obstruction to the outflow of urine, whereas in functional BOO there is a non-anatomical, non-neurogenic obstruction of the outlet usually resulting from non-relaxation of the bladder neck, sphincter or PFM, or increased urethral sphincter tone or PFM contraction during voiding, as observed in patients with dysfunctional voiding. Mechanisms for anatomical (mechanical) obstruction include external compression, fibrosis, stricture or injury to the urethra and kinking of the urethra due to POP. Progressive fibroblastic reaction around the urethra induced by mesh tapes or slings used in incontinence surgery may also cause anatomical (mechanical) obstruction [462]. In a retrospective review of 192 women diagnosed with BOO, 64% had mechanical obstruction [504]. Functional obstruction may be caused by contraction, or failure of relaxation, of the bladder neck and/or urethral sphincter complex or the PFMs during sustained detrusor contraction [509]. The exact causes of this lack of relaxation, or contraction, are often elusive but might be due to sympathetic hyperactivity or hypertrophy of the bladder neck smooth muscle for primary bladder neck obstruction [510], or may be mostly behavioural for dysfunctional voiding [511]. 4.5.2.3. Aetiology Conditions associated with anatomical BOO include POP, incontinence surgery, urethral stricture, urethral stenosis, urethral diverticulum, urethral caruncle, urethral malignancies and paraurethral masses. Conditions associated with functional BOO include primary bladder neck obstruction, dysfunctional voiding, and idiopathic urinary retention (Fowler’s syndrome). In primary bladder neck obstruction, the bladder neck fails to open adequately during voiding, in the absence of an anatomical obstruction [512]. It is estimated that 4.6–16% of women presenting with voiding symptoms have primary bladder neck obstruction [510]. Dysfunctional voiding is due to involuntary intermittent contractions of the peri-urethral striated or levator muscles during voiding in neurologically normal women, and is thought to be caused by faulty learned toileting behaviour [462]. There is also some evidence of a link between dysfunctional voiding and a history of sexual abuse [513]. Idiopathic urinary retention, also known as Fowler’s syndrome, is a primary disorder of the external urethral sphincter with hypertrophy of the muscle fibres, which fail to relax during micturition. It is associated with decreased detrusor contractility via enhancement of the guarding reflex. It is seen most often, but not exclusively, in young women with urinary retention and is characterised by increased urinary sphincter volume and activity/tone, which may be hormonally triggered [514]. Alpha-adrenergic agonists, such as pseudoephedrine commonly contained in decongestants, can lead to some form of functional obstruction due to their stimulatory effects, which may contract the bladder neck and lead to urinary retention [515]. Neurological conditions can also bring about functional BOO in women. These conditions are not considered in these guidelines and are covered elsewhere [9].
