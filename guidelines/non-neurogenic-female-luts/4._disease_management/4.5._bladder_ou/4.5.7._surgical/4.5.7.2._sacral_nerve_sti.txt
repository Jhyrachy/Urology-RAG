4.5.7.2. Sacral nerve stimulation. Sacral nerve stimulation is postulated to decrease urethral tone and to work by blockade of the inhibitory urethral afferent impulses, which cause inhibition of normal bladder contraction. No comparative trial has been identified in the literature on the use of neuromodulation for female BOO. Most publications on neuromodulation for voiding dysfunction are retrospective reviews of cases, involving a mix of patient populations who underwent the procedure for different indications. In studies that indicated a subgroup of patients with urinary retention, there was either no urodynamic confirmation of the nature of the retention or separate outcomes were not reported for participants with retention. A review of 60 women who underwent SNS for urinary retention associated with outlet obstruction (defined as UPP > 100 cm H2O, increased urethral sphincter volume > 1.8 mL, and abnormal EMG with repetitive discharges and decelerating bursts) showed an overall spontaneous voiding rate of 72% over a mean follow-up of four years. Of those who continued to require CISC up to twice daily postoperatively, the frequency was less than prior to surgery (degree not specified). There were 99 adverse events and 63 surgical revisions. In this series, half of the patients underwent a one-stage SNS procedure and the other half a two-stage procedure. The proportion of patients who required CISC-assisted voiding was higher in the two-stage group (27% vs. 17%). More serious adverse events (defined as events requiring admission or surgical revision to resolve issues such as loss of response, lead migration and surgical revisions) were associated with the one-stage procedure [557].
