3.5.1. Hypogonadism and fertility issues. Pharmacological management of hypogonadism aims to increase testosterone levels to normal levels which resolve or improve symptoms of hypogonadism. The first choice is to administer exogenous testosterone. However, while exogenous testosterone has a beneficial effect on the clinical symptoms of hypogonadism, it temporarily inhibits gonadotropin secretion by the pituitary gland, resulting in impaired spermatogenesis and sperm cell maturation [124]. Therefore, testosterone therapy is contraindicated in hypogonadal men seeking fertility treatment [81]. When secondary hypogonadism is present, gonadotropin therapy may maintain normal testosterone levels and restore sperm production [3].
