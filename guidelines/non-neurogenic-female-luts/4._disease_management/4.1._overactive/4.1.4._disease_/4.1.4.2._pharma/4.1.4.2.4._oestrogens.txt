4.1.4.2.4. Oestrogens. Oestrogen treatment for UI has been tested using oral, transdermal, and vaginal routes of administration. Vaginal (local) treatment is primarily used to treat symptoms of vaginal atrophy in postmenopausal women. Available evidence is related mainly to SUI, and although some reviews include participants with UUI, it is difficult to generalise the results to women with predominantly OAB/UUI. The association of LUTS with genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) should be considered [234]. Genitourinary syndrome of menopause is a new term that describes various menopausal symptoms and signs associated with physical changes of the vulva, vagina and LUT. These include mucosal pallor/erythema, loss of vaginal rugae, tissue fragility/fissures, vaginal petechiae, urethral mucosal prolapse, introital retraction and vaginal dryness. There is evidence from a SR to suggest benefit from vaginal oestrogen therapy in GSM [235]. All vaginal oestrogens demonstrated superiority in objective and subjective end points of GSM compared with placebo. Only some trials demonstrated superiority vs. placebo in urogenital symptoms (UI, recurrent UTI, urgency, and frequency). No significant difference was observed between various doses and dosage forms of vaginal oestrogen products. Vaginal oestrogen showed superiority over vaginal lubricants and moisturisers for the improvement of objective clinical end points of vulvovaginal atrophy but not for subjective end points [235]. Available evidence suggests that vaginal treatment with oestradiol and oestriol is not associated with increased risk of thromboembolism, endometrial hypertrophy, and breast cancer that is seen with systemicadministration [236-238].
