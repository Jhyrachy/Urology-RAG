8.2.3.1. Conservative treatment. Conservative treatment of PD is primarily focused on patients in the early stage of the disease as an adjunct treatment to relieve pain and prevent disease progression or if the patient declines other treatment options during the active phase [871,872]. Several options have been suggested, including oral pharmacotherapy, intralesional injection therapy, shockwave therapy (SWT) and other topical treatments (Table 18). The results of the studies on conservative treatment for PD are often contradictory, making it difficult to provide recommendations in everyday, real-life settings [886]. The Guidelines do not recommend the use of oral treatments for PD including pentoxifylline, vitamin E, tamoxifen, procarbazine, potassium para-aminobenzoate (potaba), omega-3 fatty acids or a combination of vitamin E and L-carnitine because of their lack of proven efficacy [871,887-889]. Studies of these treatments have numerous methodological problems including their uncontrolled nature, the limited number of patients treated, the short-term follow-up and the different outcome measures used [890,891]. Even in the absence of adverse events, treatment with these agents may delay the use of other more efficacious treatments.
