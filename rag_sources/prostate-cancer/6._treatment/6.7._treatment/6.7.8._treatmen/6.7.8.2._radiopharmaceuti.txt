6.7.8.2. radiopharmaceuticals. 6.7.8.2.1. introduction historically, several radiopharmaceuticals including phosphorous-32, strontium-89, yttrium-90, samarium-153, rhenium-186 developed treatment bone pain secondary metastases pca . proved effective palliation setting, relieving pain improving qol, especially setting diffuse bone metastases. however, never gained widespread adoption. first radioisotope demonstrate survival benefit radium-223 (see section 6.7.7.4). 6.7.8.2.2. psma-based therapy increasing use psma pet diagnostic tracer realisation allowed identification greater number metastatic deposits led attempts treat cancer replacing imaging isotope therapeutic isotope accumulates tumour demonstrated (theranostics) . therefore, identification target, usually diagnostic 68gallium-labelled psma, therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals labelled β(lutetium-177 yttrium-90) α(actinium-225)-emitting isotopes could used treat metastatic pca. psma therapeutic radiopharmaceutical supported robust data 177lu-psma-617. first patient treated 2014 early clinical studies evaluating safety efficacy 177lu-psma therapy demonstrated promising results, despite fact significant proportion men already progressed multiple therapies . early data based single-centre experience . data uncontrolled prospective phase ii trials reported high response rates low toxic effects . positive signals also coming randomised pase ii trial (therap) . therappatients cabazitaxel considered next appropriate standard treatment docetaxel highly selected 68ga-psma-11 18fdg pet-ct scans, randomised receive 177lu-psma-617 (6.0–8.5 gbq intravenously, every six weeks, six cycles) cabazitaxel (20 mg/m2 ten cycles). primary endpoint reduction least 50% psa. first endpoint met (66% vs. 37% 177lu–psma-617 vs. cabazitaxel, respectively, intention treat; difference 29% (95% ci: 16–42; p < 0.0001; 66% vs. 44% treatment received; difference 23% [9–37]; p = 0.0016) . 36 months follow-up, secondary endpoint os similar patients randomly assigned 177lu-psma versus cabazitaxel (19.1 vs. 19.6 months, difference -0.5, 95% ci -3.7 + 2.7; 177lu-psma vs. cabazitaxel, respectively), hr: 0.97, 95% ci: 0.7-1.4, p=0.99) . open-label phase iii trial (vision) compared 177lutetium vipivotid tetraxetan (177lu-psma-617 radioligand therapy) protocol-permitted soc (i.e., excluded chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radium-223 investigational drugs) mcrpc patients, psma expressing metastases pet/ct, previously treated least one arpi one (around 53%) two taxanes. imaging-based pfs os alternate primary endpoints. 800 patients randomised. 177lu-psma-617 plus soc significantly prolonged imaging-based pfs os, compared soc alone (see table 6.6.3). grade 3 aes higher 177lu-psma-617 without (52.7% vs. 38.0%), qol adversely affected. 177lu–psma-617 shown additional treatment option mcrpc population . sr updated meta-analysis, investigated proportion patients 50% psa decrease, os. review, including 69 articles total 4,157 patients, showed patients treated 177lu–psma 617 significantly higher response therapy compared controls, based ≥ 50% psa decrease (or = 5.33, 95% ci: 1.24–22.90, p < 0.05). meta-analysis revealed os 0.26 according pooled hrs psa decline, significant 177lu–psma-617 therapy (95% ci: 0.18–0.37, p < 0.00001) os 0.52 ≥ 50% psa decrease, also significant radioligand (rlt) (95% ci: 0.40–0.67, p < 0.00001) . increasing interest psma-targeted alpha therapy (225ac-psma) due ability deliver potent higher local radiation selectively cancer cells psma-targeted beta therapy, minimising unwanted damage surrounding normal tissues. additionally, intensive radiation cancer cells results effective dna strand breakage reduces development treatment resistance. meta-analysis, including nine studies 263 patients, investigated therapeutic effects 225ac-psma rlt patients metastatic crpc, pre-treated chemotherapy, 177lu-psma and/or radium-223. pooled proportions patients 50% psa decline psa decline 60.99% (95% ci: 54.92%– 66.83%) 83.57% (95% ci: 78.62%–87.77%), respectively. estimated mean pfs mean os 9.15 months (95% ci: 6.69–11.03 months) 11.77 months (95% ci: 9.51–13.49 months), respectively. findings suggests 225ac-psma rlt may effective treatment option patients mcrpc . despite encouraging therapeutic response survival patients received 225ac-psma rlt, major aes like xerostomia severe haematotoxicity considered possible reasons dose reduction discontinuation therapy.
