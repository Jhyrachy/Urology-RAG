6.2.2. Single dilatation. 6.2.2.1. Modalities of dilatation and results Dilatation can be done in the office, under local anaesthesia and without complex resources [223,224]. With dilatation, the urethral mucosa at the stricture site is stretched and the scarring is disrupted. This is opposed to DVIU where the stricture is incised. However, both treatment modalities use the same principle to achieve urethral patency: a breach of the urethral mucosa at the site of the stricture in which re-epithelialisation should occur faster than wound contraction [220]. When dilators are used to dilate bulbar urethral strictures, considerable experience is required to avoid accidental perforation of the urethra at the level of the stricture. In order to reduce the risks (esp. false passage, spongiosal perforation, urethral bleeding) of “classic” blind dilatation with rigid sounds [224], other strategies have been developed and evaluated in which the dilatation is visually controlled after a guidewire has been inserted (Table 6.4). Although no direct comparative studies of blind vs. visually controlled dilatation are available, several studies have reported a low complication rate with visually controlled modifications of dilatation. The recurrence rate largely varies between 23.5-64.5% (Table 6.4).

Effectiveness of dilatation compared with direct vision internal urethrotomy A SR identified only one prospective RCT comparing dilatation with DVIU and failed to detect any differences [196,220]. In a small (n=56) retrospective cohort study, the three-year estimated stricture recurrence-free survival was 35.5% and 28% for respectively balloon dilatation and DVIU (p=0.21) [221]. At present, there is lack of evidence to support the claim that dilatation is superior to DVIU (or vice versa) and therefore, the indications for single dilatation are the same as for DVIU. Repetitive dilatation/DVIU with curative intent (see also section 6.2.1.1.3.6 Previous interventions) should be avoided as no long-term freedom of recurrence can be expected [223] and because of the significant risk of increasing stricture length and complexity and prolonging the time to urethroplasty (which has better patency rates) [222]. Summary of evidenceLEVisually controlled dilatation after endoscopic or fluoroscopic guidewire placement has a low complication rate.3Repetitive dilatations/direct vision internal urethrotomy have no long-term freedom of recurrence and increase stricture complexity.1b RecommendationsStrength ratingUse visually controlled dilatation in preference to blind dilatation.WeakDo not perform repetitive (> 2) direct vision internal urethrotomy/dilatations if urethroplasty is a viable option.Strong
