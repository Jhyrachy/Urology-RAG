3.5.8. Cystic renal tumours. Cystic renal lesions are classified according to the Bosniak classification (see Section 5.2.5). Bosniak I and II cysts are benign lesions which do not require follow-up [72]. Bosniak IV cysts are mostly (83%) malignant tumours with pseudo-cystic changes only [73]. Bosniak IIF and III cysts remain challenging for clinicians. The differentiation of benign and malignant tumour in categories IIF/III is based on imaging, mostly CT, with an increasing role of MRI and contrast-enhanced US (CEUS). Computed tomography shows poor sensitivity (36%) and specificity (76%; κ [kappa coefficient] = 0.11) compared with 71% sensitivity and 91% specificity (κ = 0.64) for MRI and 100% sensitivity and 97% specificity for CEUS (κ = 0.95) [74]. Surgical and radiological cohorts pooled estimates show a prevalence of malignancy of 0.51 (0.44-0.58) in Bosniak III and 0.89 (0.83-0.92) in Bosniak IV cysts, respectively. In a SR, less than 1% of stable Bosniak IIF cysts showed malignancy during follow-up. Twelve percent of Bosniak IIF cysts had to be reclassified to Bosniak III/IV during radiological follow-up, with 85% of these showing malignancy, which is comparable to the malignancy rates of Bosniak IV cysts [72]. The updated Bosniak classification strengthens the classification and includes also MRI [75] and even CEUS diagnostic criteria [76]. The most common histological types for Bosniak III cysts is ccRCC with pseudo-cystic changes and low malignant potential [77,78]; multilocular cystic renal neoplasm of low malignant potential, see Section 3.4.1.1; classical pattern pRCC (very low malignant potential); benign multilocular cyst; benign group of mixed epithelial and stromal renal tumour (mixed epithelial and stromal tumour of the kidney and adult cystic nephroma); and other rare entities. Surgery in Bosniak III cysts will result in over-treatment in 49% of the tumours which are lesions with a low malignant potential. In view of the excellent outcome of these patients in general, a surveillance approach is an alternative to surgical treatment [72,75,79,80].
