9.1. PROMS and PREMS in NMIBC. As NMIBC is associated with a significant number of hospital visits and interventions (TURBT, re-TURBT, surveillance cystoscopy, intravesical instillations) survivorship has a significant effect on patient QoL [440,441]. Several Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) and Patient Reported Experience Measures (PREMs) have been developed to gauge the impact of treatment and surveillance on patients with a view to improving quality of care; however, due to lack of standardisation and heterogeneity none of them can currently be recommended for use in clinical practice [442]. Regardless, in order to provide the best possible care, clinicians should always be cognisant of the impact of disease and treatment (including surveillance) on their patientsâ€™ QoL. The use of PROMs is an important endpoint for quality metrics and RCTs should systematically incorporate PROs for patient-centred research design.
