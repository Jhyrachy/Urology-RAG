4.1. according stricture location. classification according stricture location important affect management. 4.1.1. males 4.1.1.1. anterior urethra anterior urethra runs meatus urogenital diaphragm surrounded entire length corpus spongiosum . subdivision made three different areas (from distal proximal) : meatal strictures: strictures located external urethral meatus may extend fossa navicularis glans. penile strictures: located segment fossa navicularis bulbar urethra. externally, penile urethra begins approximately balanopreputial sulcus continues penoscrotal junction. whole penile urethral segment lies groove ventral corpora cavernosa surrounded thin layer corpus spongiosum. bulbar strictures: bulbar urethra starts penoscrotal junction surrounded bulbospongious muscle. ends membranous urethra proximally level urogenital diaphragm. bulbar urethra subdivided proximal distal part. proximal bulbar urethra defined segment within 5 cm membranous urethra; urethra lies eccentrically part abundant ventral spongious tissue. distal bulbar urethra defined adjoining segment extending penoscrotal junction . strictures extending towards membranous urethra termed bulbomembranous strictures (bms). penobulbar strictures: extend penile urethra bulbar segment, compromising long segments urethra. difference penobulbar strictures multifocal strictures noted. latter defined two narrowed segments, either different subdivision urethra preserving healthy lengths urethra (e.g., iatrogenic strictures related tur procedures typically affect fossa navicularis penoscrotal junction healthy urethra between). 4.1.1.2. posterior urethra posterior urethra approximately 5 cm long, three different segments : membranous urethra area urethra traversing urogenital diaphragm, proximal bulbar distal verumontanum.the prostatic urethra runs prostatic gland, starting proximal membranous urethra extending bladder neck.the bladder neck surrounded internal urinary sphincter junction prostatic urethra bladder. stenosis (or contracture) bladder neck implies prostate situ (i.e., turp simple prostatectomies). narrowing obliteration appears level rp, correct term vuas . 4.1.2. females female urethra approximately 4 cm long arbitrarily divided upper, mid, lower part [15,125,127,128,130-132,137,139].
