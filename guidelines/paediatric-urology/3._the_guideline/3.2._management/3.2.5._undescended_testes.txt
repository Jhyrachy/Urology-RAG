3.2.5. Undescended testes and fertility. The association of undescended testes with compromised fertility [115] is extensively discussed in the literature and seems to be a result of multiple factors, including germ cell loss, impaired germ cell maturation [116], Leydig cell diminution and testicular fibrosis [117]. Although boys with one undescended testis have a lower fertility rate, they have the same paternity rate as those with bilateral descended testes. Boys with bilateral undescended testes suffer both lower fertility and paternity rates. Fertility rate is the number of offspring born per mating pair, individual or population whereas paternity reflects the actual potential of fatherhood [118]. The age at which surgical intervention for an undescended testis occurs seems to be an important predictive factor for fertility later in life. Endocrinological studies revealed higher inhibin-B and lower follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels in men who underwent orchidopexy at two years of age compared to individuals who had surgery later, which is indicative of a benefit of earlier orchidopexy [119]. In addition, others demonstrated a relation between undescended testes and increased loss of germ cells and Leydig cells, which is also suggestive of prompt orchidopexy being a significant factor for fertility preservation [120]. Outcome studies for untreated bilateral undescended testes revealed that 100% are oligospermic and 75% azoospermic. Among those successfully treated for bilateral undescended testes, 75% still remain oligospermic and 42% azoospermic [117]. In summary, early surgical correction of undescended testes is highly recommended before twelve months of age, and by eighteen months at the latest for preservation of fertility potential [71].
