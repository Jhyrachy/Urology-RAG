    "RAPTOR introduces a novel approach to retrieval-augmented language models by constructing a recursive tree structure from documents. This allows for more efficient and context-aware information retrieval across large texts, addressing common limitations in traditional language models.\n",

    "The main advantage of this tecnique is that allow summarization with a bigger but slower model preemptively, allowing the use of slower (and maybe cheaper) service like OpenAI batched inference and of smaller and faster models at runtime"
