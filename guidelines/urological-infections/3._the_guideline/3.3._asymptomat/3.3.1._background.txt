3.3.1. Background. Urinary growth of bacteria in an asymptomatic individual (asymptomatic bacteriuria - ABU) is common, and corresponds to a commensal colonisation [22]. Clinical studies have shown that ABU may protect against superinfecting UTI, thus treatment of ABU should be performed only in cases of proven benefit for the patient to avoid the risk of selecting antimicrobial resistance and eradicating a potentially protective ABU strain [23,24]. The aim of this section is to support the clinician in deciding when ABU should or should not be treated.
