3.3.5.5. Prior to urological surgery. In diagnostic and therapeutic procedures not entering the urinary tract, ABU is generally not considered as a risk factor, and screening and treatment are not considered necessary. On the other hand, in procedures entering the urinary tract and breaching the mucosa, particularly in endoscopic urological surgery, bacteriuria is a definite risk factor. Two RCTs [101,102] and two prospective non-randomised studies [103,104] compared the effect of antibiotic treatment to no treatment before transurethral prostate or bladder tumour resections. Antibiotic treatment significantly reduced the number of post-operative symptomatic UTIs compared to no treatment in the meta-analysis of the two RCTs (average RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.86; n=167). The rates of post-operative fever and septicaemia were also significantly lower in case of antibiotic treatment compared to no treatment in the two RCTs. One RCT including patients with spinal cord injury undergoing elective endoscopic urological surgeries found no significant difference in the rate of post-operative UTIs between single-dose or 3-5 days short term pre-operative antibiotic treatment of ABU [105]. A urine culture must therefore be taken prior to such interventions and in case of ABU, pre-operative treatment is recommended.
