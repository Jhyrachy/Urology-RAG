3.1. definition, epidemiology classification male hypogonadism. 3.1.1. definition male hypogonadism clinical syndrome comprises symptoms without signs biochemical evidence testosterone deficiency. hypogonadism associated decreased testicular function production androgens and/or impaired sperm production . may caused impaired testicular function (hypergonadotropic hypogonadism primary hypogonadism) result inadequate stimulation testes hypothalamic-pituitary axis (hypogonadotropic hypogonadism secondary hypogonadism) (table 1) uncommonly reduced ability testosterone stimulate androgen receptor cellular level. hypogonadism adversely affect multiple organ functions quality life (qol) . chapter specifically addresses management adult male hypogonadism also called late-onset hypogonadism (loh). insights related congenital pre-pubertal hypogonadism also provided. 3.1.2. epidemiology prevalence loh increases age, major causes obesity, comorbidities (e.g., diabetes) overall poor health . incidence hypogonadism reported 12.3 11.7 cases per 1,000 people per year . aging accounts low percentage hypogonadism, small gradual decline testosterone, age 80 years, healthy ageing men . men aged 40-79 years, incidence symptomatic hypogonadism varies 2.1 5.7% . high prevalence loh within specific populations, including patients obesity, type 2 diabetes (t2dm), metabolic syndrome (mets), cardiovascular diseases (cvd), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd), renal disease cancer . particular low testosterone levels relatively common men t2dm metabolic derangements. klinefelter syndrome, trisomy associated 47, xxy karyotype, prevalent genetic cause primary hypogonadism, global prevalence 1/500-1,000 live male births [12-15]. however, < 50% individuals klinefelter syndrome diagnosed lifetime . 3.1.3. classification male hypogonadism classified according aetiology primary hypogonadism secondary hypogonadism (table 1) . compensated subclinical form hypogonadism, characterised normal testosterone serum levels elevated luteinising hormone (lh) production, also reported ; clinical significance condition unclear [18-21]. classification hypogonadism also divided two broad categories: ‘classical/organic’ ‘functional, often correctly identified loh . clinical effects testosterone deficiency however common patients independent cause hypogonadism; although, may vary severity result age onset (see below). classical hypogonadism includes: congenital acquired diseases causing structural and/or irreversible impairment pituitary and/or testes. functional hypogonadism diagnosed absence recognised organic alterations hpg axis mainly consequence comorbidities, affecting hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular (hpt) axis treated first resolving improving underlying conditions (e.g., anorexia younger male subjects). late onset hypogonadism, conversely represents even broader clinical entity including adulthood onset forms either organic functional origin primary secondary (see below). late onset hypogonadism frequently diagnosed absence identifiable classical cause hypogonadism, becomes prevalent age, usually occurring, exclusively, men aged > 40 years. definition loh must comprise persistent specific symptoms biochemical evidence testosterone deficiency . finally, hypogonadism also result several conditions leading reduced sensitivity/insensitivity testosterone metabolites . current guidelines maintain classification primary secondary hypogonadism, special reference loh. classification, based aetiology hypogonadism, allows clinicians adequately select appropriate treatment. patients secondary hypogonadism, fertility testosterone normalisation theoretically achieved adequate treatment, whereas primary hypogonadism testosterone therapy considered (table 1). however, also recognised symptoms signs hypogonadism similarly independent site origin disease. conversely, age onset hypogonadism influence clinical phenotype . accordingly, early onset, occurring foetal life, clinical phenotype span almost complete female phenotype (e.g., complete androgen insensitivity enzymatic defects blocking androgen synthesis) various defects virilisation. case pre- peri-pubertal appearance hypogonadism due milder central (isolated hypogonadotropic hypogonadism [ihh]) peripheral defect (such klinefelter syndrome), may delayed puberty overall eunuchoid phenotype. finally, hypogonadism arises post-puberty, particularly advancing age, symptoms may manifest subtly frequently overlap natural ageing process, leading confusion . table 1: classification male hypogonadism primary hypogonadism (hypergonadotropic hypogonadism)congenital developmental disorderscommon causesuncommon causesklinefelter syndromerare chromosomal abnormalities - (xx male, 47 xyy 48 xxyy syndrome21 trisomy (down syndrome)noonan syndromeautosomal translocations1defects testosterone biosynthesiscah (testicular adrenal rest tumours)disorders sex development (gonadal dysgenesis)lhr gene mutationsmyotonic dystrophy (including type ii)uncorrected cryptorchidism (including insl3 lgr8 mutations)bilateral congenital anorchiasickle cell diseaseadreno-leukodystrophyacquired disordersdrug-inducedlocalised problemschemotherapy agentsalkylating agentsmethotrexatetestosterone synthesis inhibitors - ketoconazole, aminoglutethimide, mitotane metyraponbilateral surgical castration traumatesticular irradiationorchitis (including mumps orchitis)autoimmune testicular failuretesticular torsionalcohol/cirrhosisenvironmental toxinssystemic diseases/conditions hypothalamus/pituitary impactchronic systemic diseases*chronic organ failure*glucocorticoid excess (cushing syndrome)*ageing*hivmalignancies – lymphoma testis cancerspinal cord injuryvasculitisinfiltrative diseases (amyloidosis;
