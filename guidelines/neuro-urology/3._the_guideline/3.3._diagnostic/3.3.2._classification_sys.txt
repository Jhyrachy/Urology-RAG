3.3.2. Classification systems. The pattern of LUT dysfunction following neurological disease is determined by the site and nature of the lesion. A very simple classification system for use in daily clinical practice to decide on the appropriate therapeutic approach is provided in Figure 1 [6]. Figure 1: Patterns of lower urinary tract dysfunction following neurological diseaseThe pattern of LUT dysfunction following neurological disease is determined by the site and nature of the lesion. Panel (A) denotes the region above the pons, panel (B) the region between the pons and the sacral cord and panel (C) the sacral cord and infrasacral region. Figures on the right show the expected dysfunctional states of the detrusor-sphincter system. Figure adapted from Panicker et al.,Â [6] with permission from Elsevier.PVR = post-void residual.
