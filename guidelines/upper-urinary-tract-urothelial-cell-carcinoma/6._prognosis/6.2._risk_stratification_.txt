6.2. Risk stratification for clinical decision making. As tumour stage is difficult to assess clinically in UTUC, it is useful to stratify patients according to the low- and high risk of progression in order to identify those who are likely to benefit from kidney-sparing treatment and those who should be treated by radical nephroureterectomy [188,189]. The factors to consider for the risk stratification are presented in Figure 6.1. The level of evidence to consider individually size, multifocality and hydronephrosis as a surrogate for high-risk of progression remains low. Therefore, in the presence of low-grade disease associated with these factors, a shared decision-making process with the patient is important to discuss the therapeutic strategy (kidney-sparing strategy or RNU). Pre-RNU models aiming at predicting which patient has > pT2 /non-organ-confined disease have been published [190-194]. Several risk stratification models have been assessed with the main aim to identify better patients eligible for kidney-sparing surgery [188,189,195-197]. Prognostic nomograms based on pre-operative factors and post-operative pathological characteristics are also available [169,192,198-203] and may be used when counselling patients regarding follow-up and administration of peri-operative chemotherapy. Nevertheless, despite a moderate to good discrimination accuracy, severe heterogeneity discourages its use in systematic ways.
