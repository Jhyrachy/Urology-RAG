3.16.4.1. Extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy. Many reports confirm that SWL can be performed in children with no suspicion of long-term morbidity of the kidney [1105-1112]. The mean number of shockwaves for each treatment is approximately 1,800 and 2,000 (up to 4,000 if needed) and the mean power settings vary between 14 kV and 21 kV. Recently, two separate RCTs compared the outcomes of low vs. intermediate frequency during SWL and found no significant difference [1113,1114]. The use of US and digital fluoroscopy has significantly decreased the radiation exposure and it has been shown that children are exposed to significantly lower doses of radiation compared to adults [1095,1115,1116]. Concerns about anaesthesia no longer present a problem due to advances in technique and medication, even in the infant age group. The type of anaesthesia should be general or dissociative for children under ten years of age, whereas conventional intravenous sedation or patient-controlled analgesia is an option for older children who are able to co-operate [1117] (LE: 2b). The general perception of paediatric SWL requiring anaesthesia has been challenged by a study showing that SWL without anaesthesia can be performed safely with comparable success rates in co-operative children > 9 years of age [1118]. Stone-free rates are significantly affected by various factors. Regardless of the location, as the stone size increases, the stone-free rates decrease and retreatment rate increases. The stone-free rates for < 1 cm, 1-2 cm, > 2 cm and overall, were reported as nearly 90%, 80%, 60% and 80%, respectively. As the stone size increases, the need for additional sessions increases [1095,1115,1116,1119-1123]. Previous history of open surgery also decrease the success of SWL [1124]. Localisation of the calculi has been described as a significant factor affecting the success rates in different studies. Stones in the renal pelvis and upper ureter seem to respond better to SWL. For these locations, the stone clearance rates are nearly 90%. However, SWL was found to be less effective for caliceal stones; particularly the lower caliceal stones. Several studies reported stone-free rates for isolated lower caliceal stones varying between 50% and 62% [1123,1125,1126]. Shockwave lithotripsy can also be used to treat ureteral calculi. However, this is a more specific issue and controversial. The success rates with SWL are less for distal ureteric stones. There may also be technical problems with localisation and focusing of ureteric stones in children [1123,1126-1128]. The type of machine used significantly influences success rates and complications. First-generation machines can deliver more energy to a larger focal zone, resulting in higher fragmentation rates in a single therapy. However, general anaesthesia is usually required due to the intolerable discomfort associated with a first-generation machine. Later-generation machines have a smaller focal zone and deliver less energy, and have a lower risk of pulmonary trauma, however, additional treatments may be needed. The success rate is higher in younger children [1121]. Although stenting does not affect stone clearance, overall complication rates are higher and hospital stay is longer in the unstented patient with larger stones [1121,1123]. Stenting is essential in solitary kidneys undergoing SWL treatment. Children with a large stone burden have a high risk of developing Steinstrasse and urinary obstruction and should be followed more closely for the risk of prolonged urinary tract obstruction after SWL. Post-SWL stent or nephrostomy tube placement may be needed in prolonged obstruction [1074,1120]. The Hounsfield Unit (HU) of stone on non-contrast tomography has also been shown to be a predictive factor for success in children and SWL was found to be more successful in stones with HU less than 600 [1104] and 1,000 [1129]. Two nomogram studies revealed male gender, younger age, smaller stone size, single stone, non-lower pole localisation and negative history for previous intervention are favourable factors for stone clearance in paediatric SWL [1130,1131]. A comparative study reported that these two nomograms are independent predictors of stone-free rate following SWL in paediatric patients [1132]. A systematic review confirmed that those two nomograms have equal value in predicting outcomes of SWL in children [1133]. Although, the invention of miniaturised endoscopic instruments seems to reduce the importance and popularity of SWL, it has the advantage of not carrying the risk of certain complications related to endoscopic surgeries and also with less post-operative emergency visits, pain and anaesthetic sessions [1134,1135]. Complications arising from SWL in children are usually self-limiting and transient. The most common are:: renal colic;transient hydronephrosis;dermal ecchymosis;UTI;formation of Steinstrasse;sepsis;rarely, haemoptysis. In children with sterile pre-operative urine cultures, antibiotic prophylaxis to decrease infectious complications is not recommended [1136]. However, every effort should be made to sterilise the urine before performing SWL, ureteroscopy (URS), or percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL).
