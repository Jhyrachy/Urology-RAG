4.1.4.1.5.3. Pelvic floor muscle training. Pelvic floor muscle contraction can lead to simultaneous inhibition of urgency, detrusor contraction and incontinence [146]. Intensive and regular strength training of the PFMs over time increases both PFM contraction strength and endurance, and changes the morphology of the pelvic floor, which may yield more effective inhibition of the detrusor and help to stabilize the proximal urethra and improve urethral function. There is a lack of basic and mechanistic studies to confirm that change in pelvic floor morphology improves OAB symptoms. A SR of eleven RCTs [147] including women with OAB compared the efficacy of PFMT vs. inactive control, usual care, other lifestyle modification or other intervention. Pelvic floor muscle training significantly reduced OAB symptoms (frequency and UUI) in five RCTs, while the remaining six reported no significant difference. Significant heterogeneity in protocols and outcomes was noted.
