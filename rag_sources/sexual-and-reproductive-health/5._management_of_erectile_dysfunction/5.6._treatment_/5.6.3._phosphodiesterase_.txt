events presented tables 10 11, respectively. choice pde5i depends frequency intercourse patient’s personal experience. two meta-analyses demonstrated ed patients prioritise high efficacy use sildenafil 50 mg whereas optimise tolerability initially use tadalafil 10 mg . 5.6.3.1. sildenafil sildenafil administered doses 25, 50 100 mg. recommended starting dose 50 mg adapted according patient’s response adverse effects . window effectiveness ranges 30-60 minutes administration 12 hours . 24-week dose-response study, improved erections reported 56%, 77% 84% general ed patients taking 25, 50 100 mg sildenafil, respectively, compared 25% men taking placebo . sildenafil also significantly improved patient scores iief, sexual encounter profile question 2 (sep2), sep question 3

solid dosage forms. 5.6.3.2. tadalafil tadalafil administered on-demand doses 10 20 mg daily dose 5 mg. recommended on-demand starting dose 10 mg adapted according patient’s response adverse effects . window effectiveness ranges 30 minutes administration (peak efficacy approximately 2 hours) 36 hours . twelve-week dose-response study, improved erections reported 67% 81% men ed taking 10 20 mg

continuous use pde5is according ema, once-daily regimen tadalafil 2.5 5 mg may considered suitable, based patients’ choice physicians’ judgement. patients, recommended dose 5 mg, taken daily approximately time day. tadalafil, 5 mg daily, provides alternative on-demand tadalafil couples prefer spontaneous rather scheduled sexual activities anticipate frequent sexual activity, advantage dosing sexual activity longer need linked. regardless type ed population, clinically significant difference tadalafil treatment administered daily vs. on-demand tadalafil . overall, treatment

erections sufficient intercourse achieved 30-65.9% patients. clinical practice, recommended intra-urethral alprostadil initiated dose 500 μg, higher efficacy 250 μg dose, minimal differences regards
