3.2.5.7. Chronic post-surgical pain. Chronic post-surgical pain Chronic pain may develop following surgical procedures and has a significant impact on the individual. The ICD-11 has recently classified chronic post-surgical pain (CPSP) as a chronic pain condition. The definition of CPSP is chronic pain that develops or increases in intensity after a surgical procedure and persists beyond the healing process, i.e., at least three months after the surgery [175]. Chronic post-surgical pain may occur in a significant number of patients, and is more prevalent following some operations rather than others. Procedures with a higher risk of CPSP include limb amputation (30-85%), thoracotomy (5-65%) and mastectomy (11-57%) [176]. Risk factors for CPSP include a number of pre-, peri- and post-operative factors. Younger age, female gender, chronic pain pre-operatively elsewhere, higher number of previous operations, use of opioids and a higher post-operative pain score have been found to be associated with a higher risk of CPSP in a prospective cohort of patients undergoing laparoscopy and laparotomies. Older age, malignant indication for surgery, a higher pre-operative mental health score and the use of epidural analgesia in addition to general anaesthesia were protective [177,178]. There are a number of procedures specific to the abdomen and pelvis that are associated with an increased risk of chronic pain post-surgery, including bariatric procedures, inguinal hernia repair, vasectomy, hysterectomy and caesarean section. Adhesions are a common cause of chronic abdominal pain but despite this, a SR identified only low level evidence to help guide management of affected individuals [179]. The estimated prevalence of CPSP following bariatric surgery is 30% [180]. In affected individuals careful assessment that may include laparoscopy could identify a treatable cause (such as adhesions, mesenteric defect or cholecystitis) and lead to a significant reduction in post-operative pain [181]. Inguinal hernia repair can lead to CPSP in up to 10% of patients at six months [154] and may present with groin and/or scrotal pain. The incidence of post-vasectomy pain ranges from 2-20% [150,182]. The risk is significantly lower following the no scalpel technique [151]. The incidence of post-surgical pain following hysterectomy is difficult to determine as pain is a common indication for the operation. When defined as CPSP, rates are estimated at 28-30% [183,184]. Careful case selection and management of patient expectation is therefore important. The frequency of caesarean section has increased over time. A meta-analysis has shown a significant incidence of CPSP both at three months and at more than twelve months (15% and 11% respectively) [185], therefore careful counselling is needed in non-emergency cases.
