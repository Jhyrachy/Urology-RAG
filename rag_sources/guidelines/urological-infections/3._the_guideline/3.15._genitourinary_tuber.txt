4.6% extrapulmonary tb cases eu 1997-2017 . tuberculosis infectious disease caused group mycobacterium species called mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (mbtc) . genitourinary tb affect genitourinary organs almost always secondary due hematogenous spread chronic latent tb infection (ltbi) . risk factors include primary ltbi, diabetes, old age, low bmi, oncological comorbidities, immune suppression
