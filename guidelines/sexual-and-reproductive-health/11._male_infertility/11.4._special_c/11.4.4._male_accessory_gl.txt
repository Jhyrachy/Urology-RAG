11.4.4. Male accessory gland infections and infertility. 11.4.4.1. Introduction Infection of the male urogenital tract is a potentially curable cause of male infertility [1769-1771]. The WHO considers urethritis, prostatitis, orchitis and epididymitis to be male accessory gland infections (MAGIs) [1769]. The effect of symptomatic or asymptomatic infections on sperm quality is contradictory [1772]. A systematic review of the relationship between sexually transmitted infections, such as those caused by Chlamydia trachomatis, genital mycoplasmas, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Trichomonas vaginalis and viruses, and infertility was unable to draw a strong association between sexually transmitted infections and male infertility due to the limited quality of reported data [1773]. 11.4.4.2. Diagnostic evaluation 11.4.4.2.1. Semen analysis Semen analysis (see Section 11.3.2) clarifies whether the prostate is involved as part of a generalised MAGI and provides information regarding sperm quality. 11.4.4.2.2. Microbiological findings After exclusion of UTI (including urethritis), > 106 peroxidase-positive white blood-cells (WBCs) per millilitre of ejaculate indicate an inflammatory process. Semen culture or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis should be performed for common urinary tract pathogens in all suspected cases of genitourinary tract infections. A concentration of > 103 CFU/mL urinary tract pathogens in the ejaculate is indicative of significant bacteriospermia [1774]. The sampling should be delivered the same day to the laboratory because the sampling time can influence the rate of positive micro-organisms in semen and the frequency of isolation of different strains [1775]. The ideal diagnostic test for isolating C. trachomatis in semen has not yet been established [1776], but the most accurate method is PCR [1777-1779]. Historical data show that Ureaplasma urealyticum is pathogenic only in high concentrations (> 103 CFU/mL ejaculate). Fewer than 10% of samples analysed for Ureaplasma exceeded this concentration [1780]. Normal colonisation of the urethra hampers the significance of mycoplasma-associated urogenital infections, using samples such as the ejaculate [1781]. A meta-analysis indicated that Ureaplasma parvum and Mycoplasma genitalium were not associated with male infertility, but a significant relationship existed between U. urealyticum (OR: 3.03 95% CI: 1.02–8.99) and Mycoplasma hominis (OR: 2.8; 95% CI: 0.93– 3.64) [1782]. For these reasons, the treatment is not always recommended. The prevalence of human papilloma virus (HPV) in the semen ranges from 2 to 31% in the general population and is higher in men with unexplained infertility (10-35.7%) [1783,1784]. Systematic reviews have reported an association between male infertility, poorer pregnancy outcomes and semen HPV positivity [1785-1787]. However, data still needs to be prospectively validated to clearly define the clinical impact of HPV infection in semen. Additionally, seminal presence of Herpes Simplex virus (HSV)-2 in infertile men may be associated with lower sperm quality compared to that in HSV-negative infertile men [1772]. However, it is unclear if anti-viral therapy improves fertility rates in these men. 11.4.4.2.3. White blood cells The clinical significance of an increased concentration of leukocytes in the ejaculate is controversial [1788]. Although leukocytospermia is a sign of inflammation, it is not necessarily associated with bacterial or viral infections, and therefore cannot be considered a reliable indicator [1789]. According to the WHO classification, leukocytospermia is defined as > 106 WBCs/mL. Only two studies have analysed alterations of WBCs in the ejaculate of patients with proven prostatitis [1790,1791]. Both studies found more leukocytes in men with prostatitis compared to those without inflammation (CPPS, type NIH 3b). Furthermore, leukocytospermia should be further confirmed by performing a peroxidase test on the semen. There is currently no evidence that treatment of leukocytospermia alone without evidence of infective organisms improves conception rates [1792]. 11.4.4.2.4. Sperm quality The deleterious effects of chronic prostatitis (CP/CPPS) on sperm density, motility and morphology have been demonstrated in a recent systematic review based on case-controlled studies [1793]. Both C. trachomatis and Ureoplasma spp. can cause decreased sperm density, motility, altered morphology and increased DNA damage. Data from a retrospective cross-sectional study showed that U. urealyticum was the most frequent single pathogen in semen of asymptomatic infertile men; a positive semen culture was both univariably (p < 0.001) and multi-variably (p = 0.04) associated with lower sperm concentration [1794]. Human papilloma virus is associated with changes in semen density, sperm motility and sperm DNA damage [1783,1784]. Mycoplasma spp. can cause decreased motility and development of antisperm antibodies [1772]. 11.4.4.2.5. Seminal plasma alterations Seminal plasma elastase is a biochemical indicator of polymorphonuclear lymphocyte activity in the ejaculate [1771,1795,1796]. Various cytokines are involved in inflammation and can influence sperm function. Several studies have investigated the association between interleukin (IL) concentration, leukocytes, and sperm function through different pathways, but no correlations have been found [1797-1799]. The prostate is the main site of origin of IL-6 and IL-8 in the seminal plasma. Cytokines, especially IL-6, play an important role in the male accessory gland inflammatory process [1800]. However, elevated cytokine levels do not depend on the number of leukocytes in expressed prostatic secretion [1801]. 11.4.4.2.6. Glandular secretory dysfunction The secretory function of the prostate gland can be evaluated by measuring seminal plasma pH, citric acid, or γ-glutamine transpeptidase levels, although these parameters are not evaluated anymore in numerous laboratories; the seminal plasma concentrations of these factors are usually altered during infection and inflammation. However, they are not recommended as diagnostic markers for MAGIs [1802]. 11.4.4.2.7. Reactive oxygen species Reactive oxygen species may be increased in infertile patients with asymptomatic C. trachomatis and M. hominis infection, with subsequent decrease in ROS upon antibiotic treatment. However, ROS levels in infertile patients with asymptomatic C. trachomatis and M. hominis in the semen are low, making it difficult to draw any firm conclusions [1803]. Chronic urogenital infections are also associated with increased leukocyte numbers [1804]. However, their biological significance in prostatitis remains unclear [1771]. 11.4.4.2.8. Disease management Only antibiotic therapy of chronic bacterial prostatitis (NIH II according to the classification) has provided symptomatic relief, eradication of micro-organisms, and a decrease in cellular and humoral inflammatory parameters in urogenital secretions. Although antibiotics might improve sperm quality [1805], there is no evidence that treatment of CP/CPPS increases the probability of natural conception [1771,1806]. Asymptomatic presence of C. trachomatis and M. hominis in the semen can be correlated with impaired sperm quality, which recovers after antibiotic treatment. However further research is required to confirm these findings [1803]. 11.4.4.3. Epididymitis Inflammation of the epididymis causes unilateral pain and swelling, usually with acute onset. Among sexually active men aged < 35 years, epididymitis is most often caused by C. trachomatis or N. gonorrhoea [1807,1808]. Sexually transmitted epididymitis is usually accompanied by urethritis. Non-sexually transmitted epididymitis is associated with UTIs and occurs more often in men aged > 35 years [1809]. 11.4.4.3.1. Diagnostic evaluation 11.4.4.3.1.1. Ejaculate analysis Ejaculate analysis according to WHO Laboratory Manual for the Examination and Processing of Human Semen (6th edn) criteria, may indicate persistent inflammatory activity. Transient reductions in sperm counts and progressive sperm motility can be observed [1807,1810,1811]. Semen culture might help to identify pathogenic micro-organisms. Development of stenosis of the epididymal ducts, reduction of sperm count, and azoospermia are more important potential sequelae to consider in the follow-up of bilateral epididymitis (see Section 11.3.2). 11.4.4.3.1.2. Disease management Treatment of epididymitis results in: microbiological cure of infection;improvement of clinical signs and symptoms;prevention of potential testicular damage;prevention of transmission;decrease of potential complications (e.g., infertility or chronic pain). Patients with epididymitis known or suspected to be caused by N. gonorrhoeae or C. trachomatis must be told to also refer their sexual partners for evaluation and treatment [1812]. 11.4.4.4 Summary of evidence and recommendation for male accessory gland infections Summary of evidenceLEMale accessory gland infections are not clearly associated with impaired natural conception.3Antibiotic treatment often only eradicates micro-organisms; it has no positive effect on inflammatory alterations and cannot reverse functional deficits and anatomical abnormalities.2aAlthough antibiotic treatment for MAGIs may result in improvement in sperm quality, it does not enhance the probability of conception.2aData are insufficient to conclude whether antibiotics and antioxidants for the treatment of infertile men with leukocytospermia improve fertility outcomes.3 RecommendationsStrength ratingTreating male accessory gland infections may improve sperm quality, although it does not necessarily improve the probability of increasing conception.WeakRefer sexual partners of patients with accessory sex gland infections that are known or suspected to be caused by sexually transmitted diseases for evaluation and treatment.Strong
