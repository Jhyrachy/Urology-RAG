6.7. Summary of evidence and recommendations for prognostic factors. Summary of evidenceLEIn RCC patients, TNM stage, tumour size, grade, and RCC subtype provide important prognostic information.2aThe 2003 Leibovich score is a validated prognostic model to predict the short- and long-term risk of metastasis in individual patients with sporadic, unilateral pT1-4 N0/+ M0 clear cell renal cell carcinoma.2bThe VENUSS score is a validated prognostic model to predict the short- and long-term risk of disease recurrence in individual patients with sporadic, unilateral pT1-4 N0/+ M0 papillary renal cell carcinoma.2b RecommendationsStrength ratingUse the current Tumour, Node, Metastasis classification system.StrongUse the WHO/ISUP grading system and classify renal cell carcinoma type.StrongUse prognostic models in localised and metastatic disease.StrongUse the 2003 Leibovich scoring model for risk stratification of localised and locally advanced clear cell renal cell carcinoma.WeakUse the VENUSS scoring model for risk stratification of localised and locally advanced papillary renal cell carcinoma.WeakDo not routinely use molecular markers to assess prognosis.Strong Table 6.3: Prognostic models for localised RCC Prognostic modelSubtype*Risk factors/prognostic factorsUISS** [264]All1.
