4.2. Ureteral Trauma. 4.2.1. Incidence Trauma to the ureters is relatively rare as they are protected by their small size, mobility, posterior location, and the adjacent musculoskeletal and visceral structures. Iatrogenic injury during open, laparoscopic and endoscopic surgery is responsible for the majority of cases [126]. The injury is often missed intra-operatively and may result in significant morbidity [127]. 4.2.2. Epidemiology, aetiology, and pathophysiology Overall, ureteral trauma accounts for 1-2.5% of urinary tract trauma [126,128-130], Penetrating external ureteral trauma, mostly by gunshot wounds, is the commonest form in most modern series, [126,128,131]. Higher rates of ureteral injury are seen in modern combat injuries [127]. About one-third of cases of external trauma to the ureters are caused by blunt trauma, mostly road traffic accidents [129,130]. Ureteral injury should be suspected in all cases of penetrating abdominal injury, although it occurs in just2-3% of cases [126]. It should also be suspected in blunt trauma with significant deceleration as pelvi-ureteral disruption can result. [126]. The distribution of external ureteral injuries along the ureter varies between series, but it is commonest in the upper ureter [128-130]. The incidence of urological iatrogenic trauma has decreased in the last twenty years due to improvements in technique, instrument technology, training methods and subspecialisation [131,132]. Iatrogenic ureteral trauma can result from:- ligation with a suture,- rushing by a surgical instrument,- partial or complete transection by unintended scalpel incision,- thermal injury,- or ischaemia from devascularisation [131,133,134]. Injury usually involves the lower ureter [126,131,133,135]. Gynaecological operations are the most common cause of significant iatrogenic trauma (Table 4.2.1). It also occurs in colorectal operations, (resection of the distal colon) and vascular surgery (aortic aneurysm repair) [136,137]. There has been a significant decrease in the rate of ureteral injury during robot-assisted procedures [138] and colorectal surgery [42]. However, minimally invasive techniques have not further reduced the rate of ureteral injuries in gynaecological surgery [139-141]. Ureteroscopy is a common cause of iatrogenic ureteric trauma contributing up to 71.6% in some series [142]. The post-ureteroscopic lesion scale (PULS) aims to standardise intra-operative traumatic findings during ureteroscopy [143]. Predictors for high grade ureteric injury include male gender, longer operative times, and ureteral access sheath (UAS) insertion times [142]. A smaller proximal ureter diameter seen in CT scanning and a predictor for high-grade ureteral injury during ureteral access sheath (UAS) placement [144]. A small RCT using pre-operative silodosin 8 mg for three days significantly reduced Grade 2 or higher ureteral injuries due to UAS insertion [145]. Risk factors for iatrogenic trauma include conditions that alter the normal anatomy, e.g., advanced malignancy, prior surgery or irradiation, diverticulitis, endometriosis, anatomical abnormalities, and major haemorrhage [131,136,146,147]. Occult ureteral injury occurs more often than reported and not all injuries are diagnosed intra-operatively [127].

Diagnosis The diagnosis of ureteral trauma is challenging; therefore, a high index of suspicion should be maintained. In penetrating external trauma, it is best identified intra-operatively during laparotomy [155]. The diagnosis is delayed in most cases of blunt trauma and iatrogenic trauma [131,135,156]. 4.2.3.1. Clinical diagnosis External ureteral trauma usually accompanies severe abdominal and pelvic injuries. Penetrating trauma is usually associated with vascular and intestinal injuries, while blunt trauma is associated with damage to the pelvic bones and lumbosacral spinal injuries [129,130]. Haematuria is an unreliable and poor indicator of ureteral injury, as it is present in only 50-75% of patients [126,131,157]. Iatrogenic injury may be noticed during the primary procedure, when intravenous dye (e.g. indigo carmine) is injected to exclude ureteral injury. Early recognition facilitates immediate repair and provides a better outcome [146,155]. However, it is usually presenting later in the same admission, with the untoward sequelae of ureteral injury - upper tract obstruction, sepsis, abdominal distension, and when it is discovered by subsequent evidence of upper tract obstruction, urinary fistulae formation or sepsis. The following clinical signs are characteristic of delayed diagnosis - flank pain, urinary incontinence, vaginal or drain urinaryleakage, haematuria, fever, and uraemia or urinoma. The complication rate increases with delayed diagnosis [126,156,158]. 4.2.3.2. Radiological diagnosis Multi-phase CT is the mainstay imaging technique for trauma patients. Generally, it is widely available and allows for multi-phasic assessment of all of the structures in the pelvis and abdomen. Computed tomography urography (CTU) is the examination of choice when ureteral injuries are suspected [159,160]. Extravasation of contrast medium in the delayed phase is the hallmark sign of injury. However, hydronephrosis, ascites, urinoma or mild ureteral dilation are often the only signs. In unclear cases, a retrograde or antegrade urography is the best method for confirmation [131]. Intravenous pyelography, especially one-shot IVP, is unreliable in diagnosis, as it is negative in up to 60% of patients [126,131]. 4.2.4. Prevention of iatrogenic trauma The prevention of iatrogenic trauma to the ureters depends upon the visual identification of the ureters and careful intra-operative dissection in their proximity [131,133,134]. The use of prophylactic pre-operative ureteral stent insertion assists in visualisation and palpation can be used in cases of higher complexity [37,161]. It is probably makes it easier to detect ureteral injury intra-operatively [133]; however, it is not associated with a decrease in the likelihood of ureteric injury [152]. Apart from its evident disadvantages (potential complications, increased surgical time and cost), a stent may alter the location of the ureter and diminish its flexibility [133,151]. A retrograde instillation of indocyanine green in the ureters has been shown to safely allow their identification and preservation in complex robotic-assisted colorectal surgeries [162,163]. 4.2.5. Management Management of ureteral trauma depends on many factors including the aetiology, severity, and location of the injury. Immediate diagnosis of a ligation injury during an operation can be managed by de-ligation and stent placement. Partial injuries can be repaired immediately with a stent or urinary diversion via a nephrostomy tube. Stenting is helpful because it provides canalisation and may decrease the risk of stricture [131,164,165]. Immediate repair of complete ureteral injury is advisable as it significantly decreases the need for secondary or tertiary procedures compared to delayed repair [164]. The ureter is mobilised on both ends and a spatulated end-to-end anastomosis is performed. Primary repair by uretero-ureterostomy or ureteric re-implantation can be safely performed laparoscopically at the time of the iatrogenic injury, with good medium-term results [166]. In cases of unstable trauma patients, a ‘damage control’ approach is preferred with ligation of the ureter, diversion of the urine (e.g. via a nephrostomy), and a later delayed definitive repair [167]. A national trauma database study reported that the majority of blunt low- and high-severity traumatic ureteric injuries in both stable and unstable patients were treated by nephrostomy or stenting [168]. Exploratory laparotomy for associated traumatic injuries was a predictor for immediate ureteral reconstruction [168]. Injuries that are diagnosed late are usually managed first by placement of a nephrostomy tube or stent [131]. Endo-urological treatment of delayed-diagnosed ureteral injuries by internal stenting, with or without dilatation, is the first step in most cases. It is performed either retrogradely or antegradely via a percutaneous nephrostomy, and it has a variable success rate of 14-19% [169-171]. An open or robot-assisted laparoscopic surgical repair is necessary in case of failure [172]. The basic principles for any surgical repair of a ureteral injury are outlined in Table 4.2.2. Wide debridement is highly recommended for gunshot wound injuries due to the ‘blast effect’ of the injury. 4.2.5.1. Proximal and mid-ureteral injury Injuries shorter than 2-3 cm can usually be managed by a primary uretero-ureterostomy [126]. When this approach is not feasible, a ureterocalicostomy should be considered. In case of a large extra-renal pelvis and a stricture at the UPJ, a pelvic spiral flap (Culp de Weerd) is an option [173]. In extensive ureteral loss, a transureteroureterostomy is a valid option. The proximal stump of the ureter is transposed across the midline and anastomosed to the contralateral ureter. The reported stenosis rate is 4% and re-intervention or revision occurs in 10% of cases [174]. 4.2.5.2. Distal ureteral injury Distal injuries are best managed by ureteral re-implantation (ureteroneocystostomy) because the primary trauma jeopardises the blood supply to the distal ureter. The question of refluxing vs. non-refluxing ureteral re-implantation remains unresolved in the literature. The risk for clinically significant reflux should be weighed against the risk for ureteral obstruction. A psoas hitch between the bladder and the ipsilateral psoas tendon is usually needed to bridge the gap and to protect the anastomosis from tension. The contralateral superior vesical pedicle may be divided to improve bladder mobility. The reported success rate is very high (97%) [174]. In extensive mid-lower ureteral injury, the large gap can be bridged with a tabularised L-shaped bladder flap (Boari flap). It is a time-consuming operation and unsuited to the acute setting. The success rate is reported to be 81-88% [175]. 4.2.5.3. Long segment ureteral injury A longer ureteral injury can be replaced using a segment of the intestines, usually the ileum (ileal interposition graft). This should be avoided in patients with impaired renal function or known intestinal disease. Follow-up includes serum chemistry to diagnose hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis [176]. The long-term complications include anastomotic stricture (3%) and fistulae (6%) [177]. Another option is downward nephropexy and a long Boari flap. In cases of extensive ureteral loss or after multiple attempts at ureteral repair, the kidney can be relocated to the pelvis (auto-transplantation). The renal vessels are anastomosed to the iliac vessels and a ureteral re-implantation is performed [178,179]. Buccal mucosa ureteroplasty is an option for long segment ureteral injury, especially after a previous failed reconstruction, as an alternative to auto-transplantation. The overall success rate is 90%, but experience is limited [180]. 4.2.5.4. Permanent urinary diversion/nephrectomy Following early or late repairs, up to 38% of patients develop secondary ureteric strictures requiring interventions [181] or palliative management by indwelling ureteric catheter or nephrostomy tube [164,182]. Moreover, in some series up to 10% of failed repairs have evidence of renal parenchyma or function loss, leading to nephrectomy [164,181].
