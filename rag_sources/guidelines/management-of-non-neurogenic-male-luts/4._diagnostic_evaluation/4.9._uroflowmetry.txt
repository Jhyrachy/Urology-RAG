4.9. uroflowmetry. urinary flow rate assessment widely used non-invasive urodynamic test. key parameters qmax, voided volume, pvr, flow pattern. uroflowmetry parameters preferably evaluated voided volume > 150 ml. qmax prone within-subject variation , useful repeat uroflowmetry measurements, especially voided volume < 150 ml, qmax flow pattern abnormal. diagnostic accuracy uroflowmetry detecting boo varies considerably substantially influenced threshold values. threshold qmax 10 ml/s specificity 70%, ppv 70% sensitivity 47% boo. specificity using threshold qmax 15 ml/s 38%, ppv 67% sensitivity 82% . qmax > 15 ml/s, physiological compensatory processes mean boo cannot excluded. low qmax arise consequence boo , du under-filled bladder . therefore, limited diagnostic test unable discriminate underlying mechanisms. uroflowmetry used monitoring treatment outcomes correlating symptoms objective findings . recently, deep learning system sound-based prediction urinary flow proposed, simple home-based alternative uroflowmetry, acceptable correlation conventional test . summary evidencelethe diagnostic accuracy uroflowmetry detecting boo varies considerably substantially influenced threshold values. specificity improved repeated flow rate testing.2b recommendationsstrength ratingperform uroflowmetry initial assessment male luts.weakperform uroflowmetry prior medical invasive treatment.strong
