3.1.5.3. clinical paradigms visceral pain. referred pain referred pain frequently observed identification important diagnosis treatment. referral usually somatic somatic, visceral somatic. however, reason pain cannot also perceived within area organ nociceptive signal arisen somatic area. referred pain may occur result several mechanisms main theory one convergence-projection. convergence-projection theory, afferent fibres viscera somatic site referred pain converge onto second order projection neurons. higher centres receiving messages projection neurons unable separate two possible sites origin nociceptive signal . hyperalgesia refers increased sensitivity normally painful stimuli. patients passed renal stone, somatic muscle hyperalgesia frequently present, even year expulsion stone. pain non-painful stimuli (allodynia) may also present certain individuals. somatic tissue hyperaesthesia associated urinary biliary colic, ibs, endometriosis, dysmenorrhoea, recurrent bladder infections. primary vulvar pain syndromes examples cutaneous allodynia that, certain cases, may associated visceral pain syndromes, bps. referred pain hyperalgesia thought due central sensitisation converging viscero-somatic neurons. central sensitisation also stimulates efferent activity could explain trophic changes often found somatic tissues. musculo-skeletal system pelvic pain urogenital pain syndromes, muscle tenderness trigger points may implicated source pain. central mechanisms great importance pathogenesis muscle hyperalgesia. muscles involved may part spinal, abdominal pelvic complex muscles. unknown adjacent muscles lower limbs thorax become involved. pain may localised trigger points often associated classical referral patterns. well trigger points, inflammation ligaments tendons bones (enthesitis) bursa (bursitis) may found . certain postures affect different muscles different ways, consequence, may exacerbate reduce pain. stress, like negative sexual encounters, implicated initiator pelvic myalgia maintenance factor. visceral hyperalgesia increased perception stimuli viscera known visceral hyperalgesia, underlying mechanisms thought responsible ibs, pbps dysmenorrhoea. mechanisms involved often acute afferent input (e.g., due infection) followed long-term central sensitisation. viscero-visceral hyperalgesia thought due two organs converging sensory projections central sensitisation. instance, overlap bladder uterine afferents uterine colon afferents.
