8.4. Mesothelioma of the tunica vaginalis testis. Mesothelioma of the tunica vaginalis testis is a rare but aggressive disease [304]. Beside older age, larger tumour size, presence of necrosis, angiolymphatic invasion or a high mitotic index the only modifiable risk factors represents local recurrence. Therefore, aggressive local treatment with hemiscrotectomy is recommended. No clear recommendation can be given regarding adjuvant treatment. In case of metastatic disease, the median overall survival is a few months only and multimodal treatment could be considered.
