3.1.6. Donor complications. Living-donor nephrectomy, like any other intervention, is potentially associated with complications and mortality. However, the fact that the operation is performed on a healthy individual amplifies the relevance of any complications. Potential complications should be included in the process of informed consent. Reported surgical mortality is 0.01% to 0.03% with no apparent alteration due to changes in surgical techniques or donor selection in recent years [151,152]. According to a recent systematic review (190 studies) and meta-analysis (41 studies) on complications in minimally invasive LDN, reporting on a total of 32,308 LDNs, intra-operative complications occur in 2.2% (the most common being bleeding in 1.5% and injury to other organs in 0.8%) and post-operative complications occur in 7% (infectious complications in 2.6% and bleeding in 1%) [151]. Conversion to open surgery was reported in 1.1%, half due to bleeding and half due to injury to other organs. Surgical re-interventions occurred in 0.6%; the majority due to bleeding or to evacuate a haematoma [151]. A low trigger for conversion or re-operation should be observed in order to minimise the risk of serious complications. A recent review looked for complications in 14,964 LDNs performed in the U.S. from 2008-2012 and found an overall peri-operative complication rate of 16.8%, gastrointestinal (4.4%), bleeding (3.0%), respiratory (2.5%), surgical/anaesthesia-related injuries (2.4%), and “other” complications (6.6%). Among the sample, 2.4% required intensive care and in-hospital mortality was 0.007% [12]. Major Clavien Classification of Surgical Complications grade IV or higher affected 2.5% of donors. Risk factors for Clavien grade IV or higher events included obesity (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.55, p = 0.0005), pre-donation haematologic (aOR 2.78, p = 0.0002), psychiatric conditions (aOR 1.45, p = 0.04) and robotic nephrectomy (aOR 2.07, p = 0.002). An annual centre volume > 50 (aOR 0.55, p < 0.0001) was associated with lower risk [12]. 3.1.6.1. Long-term complications Long-term complications are mostly related to the single-kidney condition. Renal function in living donors decreases after donation before improving for many years; however, in the long run it shows signs of slight deterioration [153-155]. There is a steady increase in the incidence of proteinuria; hypertension post-transplant having been shown as the main cause of increased albumin excretion [156]. A meta-analysis found that obesity (BMI > 30) is associated with a significantly lower eGFR and higher blood pressure and proteinuria one year after donation [157]. A study looking at the Norwegian Living Kidney Donor Registry found an increased long-term risk of ischaemic heart disease in live kidney donors when compared with a healthy control group eligible to be donors [158]. The overall incidence of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (0.4-1.1%) does not differ from the general population [153,154,159,160]. According to a large retrospective study, the majority of ESRD developing after living kidney donation is due to new-onset disease that would have affected both kidneys [161]. However, there are some identified risk factors for deterioration of renal function after donation. According to a study that evaluated 119,769 live kidney donors in the United States, obese (BMI > 30) living kidney donors have a 1.9-fold higher risk for ESRD compared to their non-obese counterparts [162]. Long-term risk of death is no higher than for an age- and co-morbidity-matched population [152,159]. Health related quality of life (HRQoL), including mental condition, remains on average better than the general population after donation [159,160,163]. However, some donors experience significant deterioration in their perceived QoL [163]. While global HRQoL is comparable or superior to population normative data, some factors identifiable around time of donation including longer recovery, financial stressors, younger age, higher BMI, lower education, smoking and higher expectations prior to donation, may identify donors more likely to develop poor HRQoL, providing an opportunity for intervention [159,160,163]. It is paramount that a careful risk–benefit assessment is done and that proper information is given to the prospective donor, this should also include recommendations on health-promoting behaviour post-donation [164]. Summary of evidenceLEA systematic review and meta-analysis on complications in minimally invasive LDN concluded that the techniques used for minimally invasive LDN are safe and associated with low complication rates.1aSurvival rates and risk of end-stage renal disease are similar to those in the general population whilst donors HRQoL remains on average better than the general population.2b RecommendationsStrength ratingRestrict living donor nephrectomy to specialised centres.StrongOffer long-term follow-up to all living kidney donors.Strong
