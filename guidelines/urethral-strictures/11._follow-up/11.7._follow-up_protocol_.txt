11.7. Follow-up protocol proposal after urethroplasty. 11.7.1. Surgeries with low risk of recurrence Anastomotic urethroplasties in the bulbar/(bulbo)membranous segment with no history of radiotherapy, hypospadias, or balanitis xerotica obliterans (BXO)/LS features. Table 11.3: Follow-up protocol for urethroplasty with low risk of recurrence Surgery3 months12 months24 months*Uroflowmetry+++PROM (incl. sexual function)+++Anatomic evaluation: (Urethrocystoscopy/ RUG-VCUG)+**On indicationOn indication *Follow-up could be discontinued after two years, advising the patient to seek urological evaluation ifsymptoms worsen. Academic centres could increase the length of follow-up for research purposes.**The Panel suggests performing an anatomic assessment at three months. 11.7.2. Surgical management options with standard risk of recurrence Anastomotic urethroplasties in the bulbar segment with prior history of radiotherapy, hypospadias, or BXO/LS features;Penile urethroplasties;Non-traumatic posterior urethroplasties;Graft or/and flap – substitution – urethroplasties.

A longer follow-up period should be considered after penile and substitution urethroplasties.Academic centres could increase the length of follow-up for research purposes. Please see Figure 11.1 for further guidance.
