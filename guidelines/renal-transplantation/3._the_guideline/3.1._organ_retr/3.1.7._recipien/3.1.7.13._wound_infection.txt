3.1.7.13. Wound infection. Wound infections occur in about 4% of cases. Risk factors include recipients > 60 years, high BMI, anaemia, hypo-albuminemia, long surgical times (> 200 min) [225]. Bacteria commonly involved are Enterobacteriaceae, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas [213]. Subcutaneous sutures, pre-dialysis transplantation, sealing or ligation of lymphatic trunks, prophylactic fenestration, reducing corticosteroid load, and avoiding sirolimus/everolimus therapy can decrease wound complication rates [225].
