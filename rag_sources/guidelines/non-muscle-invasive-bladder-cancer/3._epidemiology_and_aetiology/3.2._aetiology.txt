3.2. aetiology. 3.2.1. main risk factors 3.2.1.1. tobacco tobacco smoking important risk factor bc, accounting approximately 50% cases . aromatic amines polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons within tobacco smoke, undergo renal excretion, linked development bc. risk bc increases smoking duration intensity . low-tar cigarettes associated lower risk developing bc . risk associated electronic cigarettes adequately assessed; however, carcinogens identified urine electronic cigarettes . ‘second-hand’ exposure tobacco smoke also associated increased risk bc . 3.2.1.2. occupational exposure occupational exposure aromatic amines, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons chlorinated hydrocarbons second important risk factor bc, accounting 10% cases. type occupational exposure occurs mainly industrial plants process paint, dye, metal, petroleum products . developed industrial settings risks reduced work-safety guidelines; therefore, chemical workers longer higher incidence bc compared general population . recently, greater occupational exposure diesel exhaust suggested significant risk factor (odds ratio [or]: 1.61; 95% confidence interval [ci]: 1.08–2.40) . additionally, large registry-based study one million people, follow 21 years, found residents haifa bay area israel (which centre petrochemical industry) significantly higher incidence several cancers, including bladder cancer (hazard ratio [hr] 1.11; 95% ci: 1.01–1.23), compared non-residents . 3.2.2. genetic family history seems little impact . date, clinically relevant genetic alteration linked bc. genetic predisposition may lead higher susceptibility risk factors, thereby explain familiar clustering bc first- second-degree relatives (hr: 1.69; 95% ci: 1.47−1.95) [8,20-25] confirmed recently . recent study identified three single nucleotide polymorphisms related development aggressive nmibc . currently, insufficient evidence support genetic screening bc. 3.2.3. dietary habits dietary habits seem limited impact risk developing bc. protective impact flavonoids suggested . mediterranean diet, characterised high consumption vegetables non- saturated fat (olive oil) moderate consumption protein, linked reduction bc risk (hr: 0.85; 95% ci: 0.77−0.93) [29-33]. western diet (high saturated fats) organ meat shown increase risk bc recent meta-analysis . impact increased consumption fruits suggested reduce risk bc. effect demonstrated significant women (hr: 0.92; 95% ci: 0.85–0.99) . gender discrepancy also evident blend study showed men moderate high intake vitamins b1, b2 vitamins related energy metabolism found associated increased bc risk, whereas women high intake vitamins vitamin combinations shown protective effect exception entire b group vitamin complex . one possible explanation gender discrepancies difference main source vitamin intake among study participants, meat men fruits/vegetables women. addition, higher consumption tea also associated reduction risk bc men interaction tobacco smoking; therefore, making protective effect compound questionable . 3.2.4. environmental exposure although impact drinking habits remains uncertain, chlorination drinking water subsequent levels trihalomethanes potentially carcinogenic. additionally, exposure arsenic drinking water suggested increase risk bc . arsenic intake smoking combined effect . conversely, chronic exposure nitrate drinking water seem associated increased risk bc . association personal hair dye use risk bc remains uncertain; increased risk suggested users permanent hair dyes slow nat2 acetylation phenotype large prospective cohort study could identify association hair dye risk cancer cancer-related mortality . 3.2.5. pelvic radiation exposure pelvic ionizing radiation associated increased risk bc . retrospective analysis patients localised prostate cancer, external beam radiotherapy (ebrt) independently associated risk developing second primary bc . single centre study 583 prostate cancer patients treated brachytherapy revealed risk developing bc increased received additional ebrt (n=255) (hr 3.29; 95% ci 1.03–10.52). bc specific mortality also higher combination therapy used . 3.2.6. impact metabolic factors (body mass index, blood pressure, plasma glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides) remains uncertain . however, data suggest high circulating levels vitamin associated reduction risk bc . schistosomiasis, infection caused parasitic trematode, lead bc . weak association also suggested cyclophosphamide pioglitazone .
