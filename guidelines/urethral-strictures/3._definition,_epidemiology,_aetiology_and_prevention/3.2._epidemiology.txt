3.2. Epidemiology. In males, a sharp increase in incidence is observed after the age of 55 years, with a mean age of 45.1 [17,18]. Overall, the incidence is estimated to be 229-627 per 100,000 males [17]. The anterior urethra is most frequently affected (92.2%), in particular the bulbar urethra (46.9%) [18]. In females, 2-29% of patients presenting with refractory lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) have bladder outflow obstruction (BOO) [19-22] of whom 4-20% will have a urethral stricture [21-23]. True FUS therefore occurs in 0.08-5.4% of women with refractory LUTS. There is a markedly increased incidence in women over 64 years of age [24]. After hypospadias repair, meatal stenosis and urethral strictures are reported in 1.3-20% of cases, depending on the severity of the hypospadias and the technique used [25]. There is a significantly higher incidence of this type of strictures in well-resourced countries due to a higher surgical repair rate [26]. Up to 18% of all urethral strictures have been reported to involve the meatus or fossa navicularis, usually due to failed hypospadias repair (FHR), lichen sclerosus (LS), trauma/instrumentation or idiopathic causes [27-30]. Meatal stenosis post-circumcision has been reported in less than 0.2% of children undergoing circumcision as neonates [17]. In female-to-male (FtM) transgender patients (“transmen”), 2-56% will suffer a urethral stricture. Strictures almost exclusively arise at the neomeatus in male-to-female (MtF) transgender patients (“transwomen”) and occur in 4-40% of cases [31].
