5.2.1. Drugs for chronic primary pelvic pain syndrome. In this section the evidence available for specific CPPPSs is presented. Where there is no evidence the reader is directed to the section on analgesics below (Section 5.2.2) where more generic use is discussed. There is a large discrepancy in the treatment effects reported in case series and controlled trials that results from a large placebo effect or publication bias. As a result of the multifactorial origin of for example PPPS, one reason for treatment failure in some large placebo-controlled RCTs, may be the heterogeneity of the patient population [350]. One strategy for improving treatment effects may be stratification of patient phenotypes. A prospective series of phenotypically directed treatment for CPPPS has shown significant improvement of symptoms and QoL [351]. Monotherapeutic strategies for the treatment of CPPPS may fail [352], therefore, most patients require multimodal treatment aimed at the main symptoms, and taking comorbidity into account. In the past ten years, results from RCTs have led to advances in standard and novel treatment options.
