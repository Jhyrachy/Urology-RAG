3.1. Definition, epidemiology and classification of male hypogonadism. 3.1.1. Definition Male hypogonadism is a clinical syndrome which comprises of symptoms with or without signs and biochemical evidence of testosterone deficiency. Hypogonadism is associated with decreased testicular function and production of androgens and/or impaired sperm production [3]. This may be caused by impaired testicular function (hypergonadotropic hypogonadism or primary hypogonadism) or as a result of inadequate stimulation of the testes by the hypothalamic-pituitary axis (hypogonadotropic hypogonadism or secondary hypogonadism) (Table 1) or uncommonly by reduced ability of testosterone to stimulate the androgen receptor at the cellular level. Hypogonadism can adversely affect multiple organ functions and quality of life (QoL) [3,4]. This chapter specifically addresses the management of adult male hypogonadism also called late-onset hypogonadism (LOH). Some insights related to congenital or pre-pubertal hypogonadism are also provided. 3.1.2. Epidemiology The prevalence of LOH increases with age, with the major causes being obesity, other comorbidities (e.g., diabetes) and overall poor health [5]. The incidence of hypogonadism has been reported to be between 12.3 and 11.7 cases per 1,000 people per year [6,7]. Aging accounts for a low percentage of hypogonadism, as there is only a small gradual decline in testosterone, up to the age of 80 years, in healthy ageing men [5]. In men aged 40-79 years, the incidence of symptomatic hypogonadism varies between 2.1 and 5.7% [6,8,9]. There is a high prevalence of LOH within specific populations, including patients with obesity, type 2 diabetes (T2DM), metabolic syndrome (MetS), cardiovascular diseases (CVD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), renal disease and cancer [9]. In particular low testosterone levels are relatively common in men with T2DM [10,11] and in those with metabolic derangements. Klinefelter syndrome, a trisomy associated with a 47, XXY karyotype, is the most prevalent genetic cause of primary hypogonadism, with a global prevalence of 1/500-1,000 live male births [12-15]. However, < 50% of individuals with Klinefelter syndrome are diagnosed during their lifetime [16]. 3.1.3. Classification Male hypogonadism can be classified according to the aetiology into primary hypogonadism or secondary hypogonadism (Table 1) [3,17]. A compensated or subclinical form of hypogonadism, characterised by normal testosterone serum levels and elevated luteinising hormone (LH) production, has also been reported [18]; the clinical significance of this condition is unclear [18-21]. The classification of hypogonadism has also been divided into two broad categories: ‘Classical/Organic’ and ‘Functional, often but not correctly identified as LOH [58]. The clinical effects of testosterone deficiency are however common to all patients independent of the cause of the hypogonadism; although, they may vary in severity or as a result of age of onset (see below). Classical hypogonadism includes: congenital or acquired diseases causing structural and/or irreversible impairment of the pituitary and/or testes. Functional hypogonadism is diagnosed on the absence of any recognised organic alterations in the HPG axis and it is mainly a consequence of comorbidities, affecting the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Testicular (HPT) axis and should be treated first by resolving or improving any underlying conditions (e.g., anorexia in younger male subjects). Late onset hypogonadism, conversely represents even a broader clinical entity including adulthood onset forms which can have either organic or functional origin and can be primary or secondary [22] (see below). Late onset hypogonadism is frequently diagnosed in the absence of an identifiable classical cause of hypogonadism, which becomes more prevalent with age, usually occurring, but not exclusively, in men aged > 40 years. By definition LOH must comprise both persistent specific symptoms and biochemical evidence of testosterone deficiency [3,23]. Finally, hypogonadism can also result from several conditions leading to reduced sensitivity/insensitivity to testosterone and its metabolites [3]. The current guidelines maintain a classification of Primary and Secondary Hypogonadism, with special reference to LOH. The classification, based on the aetiology of hypogonadism, allows clinicians to adequately select appropriate treatment. In patients with secondary hypogonadism, both fertility and testosterone normalisation can be theoretically achieved with adequate treatment, whereas in primary hypogonadism only testosterone therapy can be considered [3,17] (Table 1). However, it should also be recognised that symptoms and signs of hypogonadism can be similarly independent of the site of origin of the disease. Conversely, the age of onset of hypogonadism can influence the clinical phenotype [24]. Accordingly, early onset, such as that occurring during foetal life, the clinical phenotype can span from an almost complete female phenotype (e.g., complete androgen insensitivity or enzymatic defects blocking androgen synthesis) to various defects in virilisation. In the case of a pre- or peri-pubertal appearance of hypogonadism due to a milder central (isolated hypogonadotropic hypogonadism [IHH]) or a peripheral defect (such as in Klinefelter syndrome), there may be delayed puberty with an overall eunuchoid phenotype. Finally, when hypogonadism arises post-puberty, particularly with advancing age, symptoms may manifest subtly and frequently overlap with the natural ageing process, leading to confusion [24].
