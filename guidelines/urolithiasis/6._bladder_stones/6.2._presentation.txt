6.2. Presentation. The symptoms are most associated with bladder stones are urinary frequency, haematuria (which is typically terminal) and dysuria or suprapubic pain, which are worst towards the end of micturition. Sudden movement and exercise may exacerbate these symptoms. Detrusor over-activity is found in over two-thirds of adult male patients with vesical calculi and is significantly more common in patients with larger stones (> 4 cm). However, recurrent UTIs may be the only symptom [710,711]. In children, symptoms may also include pulling of the penis, difficulties in micturition, urinary retention, enuresis, and rectal prolapse (resulting from straining due to bladder spasms). Bladder stones may also be an incidental finding in 10% of cases [708,726].
