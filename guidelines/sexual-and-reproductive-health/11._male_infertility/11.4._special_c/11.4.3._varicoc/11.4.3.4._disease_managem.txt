11.4.3.4. Disease management. Several treatments are available for varicocele (Table 41). Impact on pregnancy rate and semen parameters Current evidence indicates that microsurgical varicocelectomy is the most effective among the different varicocelectomy techniques [1742,1751]. A Cochrane review reported that microsurgical subinguinal varicocelectomy probably improves pregnancy rates slightly more compared to other surgical treatments (RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.36) [1736]. A subgroup analysis from a systematic review of prospective randomised and non-randomised studies reported that surgical approach (including all possible surgical techniques) significantly improved pregnancy rates and sperm concentration as compared with controls, while the same was not demonstrated for radiological treatment [1733]. However, the most recent Cochrane review showed inconclusive results about the effect of surgical vs. radiological treatment on pregnancy rates and varicocele recurrence [1736]. There are no large prospective RCTs comparing the efficacy of the various interventions for varicocele. Complications Microsurgical repair results in fewer complications and lower recurrence rates compared to the other techniques [1736,1752,1753]; however, this procedure, requires microsurgical training. The various other techniques are still considered viable options, although recurrences and hydrocele formation appear to be higher [1753]. Radiological techniques (sclerotherapy and embolisation) are minimally invasive approaches for varicocele treatment. Although higher recurrence rates have been reported compared to microscopic varicocelectomy [1754], a meta-analysis showed that the incidence of varicocele recurrence was similar after surgical ligation and sclero-embolisation [1754]. In terms of complications, a meta-analysis of twelve studies comparing 738 cases of surgical ligation vs. 647 cases of sclero-embolisation, showed that overall complications rate did not differ significantly between the groups (OR 1.48; 95% CI 0.86â€“2.57, p = 0.16) [1754]. The incidence of post-operative hydrocele is significantly higher after surgical ligation than sclero-embolisation, but radiological techniques are associated with higher incidence of post-operative orchiepidydimitys [1754]. Robot-assisted varicocelectomy has a similar success rate compared to the microscopic varicocelectomy technique, although larger prospective randomised studies are needed to establish the most effective method [1755-1757].
