6.4. Conclusion. The updated TCGA and other efforts have refined our understanding of the molecular underpinnings of BC biology. Molecular variants, immune gene signatures as well as stromal signatures may ultimately have an important role in predicting response to IO. Although PD-L1 expression by immunohistochemistry and TMB have demonstrated predictive value in certain settings, additional studies are needed. Prospectively validated prognostic and predictive molecular biomarkers will present valuable adjuncts to clinical and pathological data, but large phase III RCTs with long-term follow-up will be needed to clarify the many questions remaining.
