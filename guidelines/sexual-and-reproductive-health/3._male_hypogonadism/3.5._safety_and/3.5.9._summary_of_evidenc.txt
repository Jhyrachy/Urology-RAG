3.5.9. Summary of evidence and recommendations on safety and monitoring in testosterone treatment. Summary of evidenceLETestosterone therapy is contraindicated in men with secondary hypogonadism who desire fertility.1aTestosterone therapy is contraindicated in men with active prostate cancer or breast cancer, as these patients are usually excluded from RCTs.1aTestosterone therapy does not increase the risk of prostate cancer, but long-term prospective follow-up data are required to validate this statement.1aThe effect of testosterone therapy in men with severe lower-urinary tract symptoms is limited, as these patients are usually excluded from RCTs.1aThere is no substantive evidence that testosterone therapy, when replaced to normal levels, results in the development of major adverse cardiovascular events.1aThere is no evidence of a relationship between testosterone therapy and mild, moderate or CPAP-treated severe sleep apnoea.1b RecommendationsStrength ratingFully counsel symptomatic hypogonadal men who have been surgically treated for localised prostate cancer (PCa) and who are currently without evidence of active disease considering testosterone therapy, emphasising the lack of sufficient safety data on long-term follow-up.WeakRestrict treatment to patients with a low risk of recurrent PCa*. Treatment should start after at least one year of follow-up with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level < 0.01 ng/mL.WeakAdvise patients that safety data on the use of testosterone therapy in men treated for breast cancer are unknown.StrongAssess cardiovascular risk factors before commencing testosterone therapy.StrongAssess men with known cardiovascular disease (CVD) for cardiovascular symptoms before initiating testosterone therapy and monitor these men with close clinical assessment and evaluation during treatment.StrongTreat men with hypogonadism and pre-existing CVD, venous-thromboembolism or chronic cardiac failure, who require testosterone therapy with caution, by careful clinical monitoring and regular measurement of haematocrit (not exceeding 54%) and testosterone levels.WeakExclude a family history of venous-thromboembolism before starting testosterone therapy.StrongMonitor testosterone, and haematocrit at three, six and twelve months after testosterone therapy initiation, and thereafter annually. A haematocrit > 54% requires testosterone therapy adjustment or withdrawal and venesection if required. Re-introduce testosterone therapy at a lower dose once the haematocrit has normalised and consider switching to topical testosterone preparations.StrongEvaluate patients with polycythaemia vera and those with a higher risk of developing elevated haematocrit every three months during the first year of testosterone therapy, and at least every six months thereafter.StrongEvaluate total PSA in PCa survivors at three, six and twelve months during the first year of testosterone therapy, and annually thereafter.Strong *As for EAU risk groups for biochemical recurrence of localised or locally advanced prostate cancer(see EAU Prostate Cancer Guidelines, 2024)
