4.1.1. Epidemiology, aetiology, pathophysiology. Overactive bladder syndrome is defined by the ICS as “urinary urgency, usually accompanied by frequency and nocturia, with or without UUI, in the absence of UTI or other obvious pathology” [113]. Overactive bladder is a chronic condition that can have debilitating effects on QoL. The hallmark urodynamic feature is DO but the diagnosis of OAB is exclusively based on symptoms. The EPidemiology of InContinence (EPIC) study [114] was a cross-sectional telephone survey of adults conducted in five countries and demonstrated an overall prevalence of OAB symptoms of 11.8% (10.8% in men and 12.8% in women). Various theories have been proposed to explain the pathophysiology of OAB, mainly relating to imbalances in inhibitory and excitatory neural pathways to the bladder and the urethra or sensitivity of bladder muscle receptors. However, no definite identifiable causes have been established.
