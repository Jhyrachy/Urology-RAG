3.10.3. Diagnostic evaluation. 3.10.3.1. Medical history Medical history includes the question of a primary (first) or secondary (recurring) infection; possible malformations of the urinary tract (e.g. pre- or post-natal US screening); prior operation; family history; and, whether there is constipation or presence of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). 3.10.3.2. Clinical signs and symptoms Neonates with severe UTI can present with non-specific symptoms (failure to thrive, jaundice, hyperexcitability) and without fever. In neonates it is important to rule out a co-existing meningitis [473]. Urinary tract infection is the cause of fever in 4.1-7.5% of children who present to a paediatric clinic [474,475]. Septic shock is unusual, even with very high fever. Signs of a UTI may be vague and unspecific in small children, but later on, when they are more than two years old, frequent voiding, dysuria and suprapubic, abdominal or lumbar pain can be detected. 3.10.3.3. Physical examination Physical examination includes a general examination of the throat, lymph nodes, abdomen (constipation, palpable and painful kidney, or palpable bladder), flank, the back (stigmata of spina bifida or sacral agenesis), genitalia (phimosis, labial adhesion, vulvitis, epididymo-orchitis), measurement of body weight and temperature. 3.10.3.4. Urine sampling, analysis and culture Urine sampling has to be performed before any antimicrobial agent is administered. The technique for obtaining urine for urinalysis as well as culture affects the rate of contamination, which influences interpretation of the results. Especially in early infancy, it can be challenging and depends on the mode of urine sampling [476]. 3.10.3.4.1. Urine sampling Urine must be collected under defined conditions and investigated as soon as possible to confirm or exclude UTI, especially in children with fever. In neonates, infants and non-toilet-trained children, there are four main methods with varying contamination rates and invasiveness to obtain urine: (1) Plastic bag attached to the cleaned genitalia: Although this technique is most often used in daily practice, contamination rates are high with around 50-60% [477]. It is helpful when the culture results are negative. Also, if the dipstick is negative for both leukocyte esterase and nitrite, or microscopic analysis is negative for both pyuria and bacteriuria, UTI can be excluded without the need for confirmatory culture [478]. (2) Clean-catch urine (CCU) collection: The infant is placed in the lap of a caregiver or member of the nursing staff, who holds a sterile foil bowl underneath the infant’s genitalia. The infant is offered oral fluids and urine collection is awaited [479]. Suprapubic tapping alternated with paravertebral lumbar massage can stimulate sponateous voiding [477,480]. There seems to be a good correlation between the results of urine culture obtained by this method and suprapubic aspiration (SPA), with a false-positive rate of 5% and false-negative rate of 12% [479,481]; however, the contamination rate is higher for CCU with up to 26% compared to catheterisation 10% and SPA 1% [477,482]. In one prospective cohort study in infants below the age of six months, the success rate was 49% and the contamination rate 16% with some differences in the culture results between those obtained by CCU and those by more invasive methods [483]. (3) Transurethral bladder catheterisation: is the fastest and safest method to obtain a reliable urine sample fo microscopic and bacteriological evaluation to rule out or to document a UTI in non-toilet trained infants and children. (4) Suprapubic bladder aspiration: This is the most invasive but also the most sensitive method to obtain an uncontaminated urine sample in this age group [484,485]. For suprapubic puncture ultrasound imaging should be performed to asses bladder filling. A two-step procedure where the CCU is screened and a catheter or SPA confirmation of the positive screens is used can lead to a reduction in invasive procedures [477,482]. In older, toilet-trained children who can void on command, after carefully retracting the foreskin and cleaning the glans penis in boys and spreading the labia and cleaning the peri-urethral area in girls, the use of clean catch, especially midstream urine, could be an acceptable technique for obtaining urine. After cleaning the urethral meatus and perineum with gauze and liquid soap twice, the risk of contamination was reduced from 23.9% (41/171) to 7.8% (14/171) in a randomised trial [486]. 3.10.3.4.2. Urinalysis There are three methods that are commonly used for urinalysis: (1) Dipsticks: These are appealing because they provide rapid results, do not require microscopy, and are ready to use. Leukocyte esterase (as a surrogate marker for pyuria) and nitrite (which is converted from dietary nitrates by most Gram-negative enteric bacteria in the urine) are the most frequent markers, and are usually combined in a dipstick test. The conversion of dietary nitrates to nitrites by bacteria takes approximately four hours in the bladder [481,487]. Using only nitrate sticks to screen febrile children < 2 years of age has a too low sensitivity and relevant UTIs can be missed. However, the specificity is high for children at any age [488,489]. In febrile infants < 90 days old urine dipstick tests using CCU samples can be used for screening for a UTI when nitrites and leukocyte esterase combined are used with a sensitivity of 86% and a specificity of 80% [490]. (2) Microscopy: This is the standard method of assessing pyuria after centrifugation of the urine with a threshold of five white blood cells (WBCs) per high-power field (25 WBC/μL) [491]. In uncentrifuged urine, > 10 WBC/μL has been demonstrated to be sensitive for UTI [492] and this could perform well in clinical situations [493]. However, this is rarely done in an outpatient setting. No significant differences was found between dipsticks and microscopy testing for UTI [489]. A meta-analysis showed, that only microscopy with Gram staining has a higer sensitivity compared to dipsticks [494]. (3) Flow imaging analysis technology: This is being used increasingly to classify particles in uncentrifuged urine specimens [495]. The numbers of WBCs, squamous epithelial cells and red cells correlate well with those found by manual methods [481]. Flow cytometry-based bacterial and leukocyte count analysis when using a cut-off value of 250 bacteria/uL in the presence of leukocyturia has a sensitivity of 0.97 and specificity of 0.91 for diagnosing UTI [496]. 3.10.3.4.3. Urine culture After negative results for dipstick, microscopic or automated urinalysis, urine culture is generally not necessary, especially if there is an alternative source of fever. If the dipstick result is positive, confirmation by urine culture is strongly recommended. It is unclear what represents a significant UTI. In patients with a severe UTI, ≥ 105 cfu/mL can be expected. However, the count can vary and be related to the method of specimen collection, diuresis, and time and temperature of storage until cultivation occurs [457]. Clean-catch urine, midstream and catheterisation urine cultures can be considered positive as 103 - 104 cfu/mL in a monoculture, and any counts obtained after SPA should be considered as significant. Mixed cultures are indicative of contamination. In febrile children < 4 months of age a cut-off value of 103 cfu/mL can be used when clinical and laboratory findings match and a correct sampling method has been used [497]. A negative culture with the presence of pyuria may be due to incomplete antibiotic treatment, urolithiasis, or foreign bodies in the urinary tract, and infections caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis or Chlamydia trachomatis. A flowchart was developed as guidance during the basic diagnostic evaluation and subsequent management of febrile children with clinical symptoms of UTI, Figure 5. Figure 5: Diagnostic evaluation and subsequent management of a febrile child with clinical symptoms of UTICRP = C-reactive protein; AB = antibiotic. 3.10.3.5. Imaging 3.10.3.5.1. Ultrasound Renal and bladder US within 24 hours is advised in infants with febrile UTI to exclude obstruction of the upper and lower urinary tract. Abnormal results are found in 15% of cases, and 1-2% have abnormalities that require prompt action (e.g., additional evaluation, referral or surgery) [478]. When a renal US is performed in all children presenting with a UTI, 7% will have an abnormal US warranting further investigations [498]. The sensitivity to detect high-grade VUR with US was found to be 0.59 (CI: 0.45-0.72) with a specificity of 0.79 (CI: 0.65-0.87) [499]. Renal US should be performed before and after voiding. Post-void residual (PVR) urine should be measured in toilet-trained children to exclude voiding abnormalities as a cause of UTI. Elevated PVR urine volume predicts recurrence of UTIs in toilet-trained children [500]. When peri-renal or psoas abcesses or renal masses are seen on US, it is important to consider xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis, and subsequent CT imaging is proposed [501]. 3.10.3.5.2. Radionuclide scanning/MRI Changes in dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) clearance during acute UTI indicate pyelonephritis or parenchymal damage, correlated with the presence of dilating reflux and the risk of further pyelonephritis episodes, breakthrough infections [502] and future renal scarring. In the acute phase of a febrile UTI (up to four to six weeks), DMSA-scan can demonstrate pyelonephritis by perfusion defects. Renal scars can be detected after three to six months [503]. Diffusion-weighted MRI has shown to accurately diagnose acute pyelonephritis and reveal late renal scars and could be an alternative to DMSA; therefore, avoiding radion burden [504]. The average effective radiation dose of a single DMSA scan was 2.84 (1-12) mSv in one study [505]. These findings are different in neonates. After the first symptomatic, community-acquired UTI, the majority of renal units with VUR grade III or higher had normal early DMSA scanning [506]. The sensitivity of the DMSA scan to detect VUR is 0.75 (CI: 0.67-0.81) with a specificity of 0.48 (CI: 0.38-0.57), and a negative DMSA scan resulting in a very low probability of high-grade VUR [507]. 3.10.3.5.3. Voiding cystourethrography/urosonography The optimum method to exclude or confirm VUR is VCUG. The timing of VCUG does not influence the presence or severity of VUR [508]. Performance of early VCUG in patients with proven sterile urine does not cause any significant morbidity [509]. Using harmonic voiding urosonography may be an alternative to the standard VCUG avoiding radiation [510]. Visulatisation of the urethra may be difficult with this technique. It is important to diagnose high-grade VUR after the first UTI since this is an important risk for renal scarring. On the other hand, physicians want to avoid unnecessary VCUG investigations at the same time, given its invasive character and radiation burden [498,511]. Various studies have investigated the risk factors for high-grade VUR and a top down approach is feasible. The most important risk factors for high-grade VUR and subsequent renal scarring are: abnormal renal US, high fever UTI and non-E. Coli infections. Different top down strategies with selective VCUG investigations have been proposed [512-516]. Based on these studies we recommend the following updated diagnostic strategy (see Figure 6). Figure 6: Diagnosis strategy for first febrile UTIUTI = urinary tract infection; VUR = vesicoureteral reflux; i.v. = intravenous; BBD = bladder and bowl dysfunction.
