5.5.2. Medical conditions and sleep disorders Shared Care Pathway. Causative categories for nocturia comprise [568]: bladder storage problems;24-hour polyuria (> 40 mL/kg urine output over a 24-hour period);nocturnal polyuria (NP; defined as excessive production of urine during the individual’s main sleep period, i.e. nocturnal output exceeding 20% of 24-hour urine output in the young, or 33% of urine output in people > 65 [3]);sleep disorders;mixed aetiology. Potentially relevant systemic conditions are those which impair physiological fluid balance, including influences on the levels of free water, salt, other solutes, and plasma oncotic pressure; endocrine regulation e.g., by antidiuretic hormone; natriuretic peptides; cardiovascular and autonomic control; renal function; neurological regulation, e.g., circadian regulation of the pineal gland, and renal innervation. As nocturia is commonly referred to the specialty without full insight into cause, the urologist must review the likely mechanisms underlying a presentation with nocturia and instigate review by relevant specialties accordingly. Thus, the managing urologist needs to evaluate nocturia patients in a context where additional medical expertise is available (Table 3). They should not proceed along any LUTD management pathway unless a causative link with LUTD is justifiably suspected, and systemic or sleep abnormalities have been considered. In patients with non-bothersome nocturia, the medical evaluation (history and physical examination) should consider the possibility of early stages of systemic disease, and whether there is possibility of earlier diagnosis or therapy adjustment. Some important potentially treatable non-urological causes of nocturia include obstructive sleep apnoea, congestive cardiac failure, poorly controlled diabetes mellitus and medications (e.g., diuretics, or lithium).
