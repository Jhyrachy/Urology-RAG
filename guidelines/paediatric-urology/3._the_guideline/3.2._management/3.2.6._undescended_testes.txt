3.2.6. Undescended testes and malignancy. Boys who are treated for an undescended testis have an increased risk of developing testicular malignancy. Screening and self-examination both during and after puberty is therefore recommended [121]. A Swedish study, with a cohort of almost 17,000 men (56 developed a testicular tumour) who were treated surgically for undescended testes and followed for 210,000 person-years, showed that management of undescended testes before the onset of puberty decreased the risk of testicular cancer. The relative risk of testicular cancer among those who underwent orchidopexy before thirteen years of age was 2.2 compared to the Swedish general population; this increased to 5.4 for those treated after thirteen years of age [122]. A systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature have also concluded that pre-pubertal orchidopexy may reduce the risk of testicular cancer and that early surgical intervention is indicated in boys with undescended testes [123].
