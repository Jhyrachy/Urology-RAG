3.11.2. diagnostic evaluation. evaluation lut conditions includes medical voiding history (bladder diaries structured questionnaires), physical examination, urinalysis, uroflowmetry pvr. upper urinary tract (uut) needs evaluated children recurrent infections dysfunctional voiding. uroflowmetry combined pelvic floor electromyography demonstrate overactivity pelvic floor muscles voiding. urodynamic studies usually reserved patients therapy resistant dysfunctional voiding responding treatment considered invasive treatment [566,571-574]. addition comprehensive medical history detailed voiding diary provides documentation voiding defecation habits, frequency micturition, voided volumes, night-time urine output, number timing incontinence episodes, fluid intake. voiding diary least done two days, although longer observation periods preferred. voiding diary provides information storage function incontinence frequency, pad test help quantify urine loss. paediatric age group, history taken caregivers child together, structured approach recommended using questionnaire. many signs symptoms related voiding wetting unknown caregivers specifically requested, using questionnaire checklist. symptom scorings developed validated . although reliability questionnaires limited practical clinical setting check presence symptoms also shown reliable monitor response treatment. history taking also include assessment bowel function. evaluation bowel function children, bristol stool scale easy-to-use tool . urinalysis urinary culture essential evaluate uti. since transient voiding symptoms common presence uti, exclusion uti essential management symptoms. clinical examination, genital inspection observation lumbosacral spine lower extremities necessary exclude obvious uropathy neuropathy. uroflowmetry pvr evaluates emptying ability, uut us screens (secondary) anatomical changes. flow rate reaches maximum quickly levels (‘tower shape’) may indicative over-active bladder whereas interrupted staccato voiding patterns may seen dysfunctional voiding. plateau uroflowmetry patterns usually seen anatomic obstruction flow. single uroflowmetry test may always representative clinical situation multiple uroflowmetry tests, give similar result, reliable. uroflowmetry examination done desire empty bladder voided volume least 50% age-expected capacity [(age years) + 1] x 30 ml children. testing child clinical environment, impact stress mood changes bladder function also taken account . case treatment failure re-evaluation warranted (video)-urodynamic (vud) studies neurological evaluation may considered. sometimes, minor, underlying, urological neurological problems, suspected using vud. cases, structured psychological interviews assess social stress added (le: 1b). video-urodynamics may also used initial investigational tool patients suspicion reflux. case reflux may observed along bladder dynamics. case anatomical problems, posterior urethral valve (puv) problems, syringocoeles, congenital obstructive posterior urethral membrane (copum) moormann’s ring, may necessary perform cystoscopy treatment. neuropathic disease suspected, mri lumbosacral spine medulla help exclude tethered cord, lipoma rare conditions.
