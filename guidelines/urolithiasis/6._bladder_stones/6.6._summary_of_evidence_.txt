6.6. Summary of evidence and recommendations for the treatment of bladder stones. Summary of evidenceLEThe incidence of bladder stones peaks at three years in children (endemic/primary stones in developing countries) and 60 years in adults.2cIn adults, BOO is the most common pre-disposing factor for bladder stone formation.2cOf men undergoing surgery for BPO, 3-4.7% form bladder stones.2bPrimary (endemic) bladder stones typically occur in children in areas with poor hydration, recurrent diarrhoea, and a diet deficient in animal protein. The following measures are proposed to reduce their incidence: maintenance of hydration, avoidance of diarrhoea, and a mixed cereal diet with milk and Vitamins A and B supplements; with the addition of eggs, meat, and boiled cows’ milk after one year of age.5Endoscopic bladder stone treatments (trans-urethral or percutaneous) are associated with comparable SFRs, but a shorter length of hospital stay, duration of procedure and duration of catheterisation compared to open cystolithotomy in adults.1aStone-free rates are lower in patients treated with SWL than those treated with open or endoscopic procedures in both adults and children.2aTransurethral cystolithotripsy is associated with a shorter length of hospital stay, less pain and a shorter convalescence period than percutaneous cystolithotripsy in adults.1bTransurethral cystolithotripsy with a nephroscope is quicker than when using a cystoscope with no difference in SFR in adults.1aMechanical, pneumatic and laser appear equivalent lithotripsy modalities for use in endoscopic bladder stone treatments in adults and children.2aOpen cystolithotomy without a retropubic drain or urethral catheter (“tubeless”) is associated with a shorter length of hospital stay than traditional cystolithotomy and can be performed safely in children with primary stones and no prior bladder surgery or infections.2bBladder stone removal with concomitant treatment for BOO is associated with no significant difference in major post-operative complications when compared to BOO treatment alone in adults. However, concomitant bladder stone treatment does increase the rates of short-term post-operative incontinence and UTI.2bThe incidence of bladder stone formation in spinal cord injury patients is 19-67% over time. The absolute annual risk of stone formation in spinal cord injury patients is significantly higher with an indwelling catheter compared to those voiding with CISC or spontaneously.2bThe incidence of bladder stone formation after bladder augmentation or vesico-entero-cystostomy is between 2-53% in adults and children.2bThe risk of bladder stone formation in spinal cord injury, bladder augmentation or continent urinary diversion patients is reduced by performing regular bladder irrigation.2b RecommendationsStrength ratingUse ultrasound (US) as first-line imaging with symptoms suggestive of a bladder stone.StrongUse cystoscopy or computed tomography (CT), or kidney-ureter-bladder X-Ray (KUB) to investigate adults with persistent symptoms suggestive of a bladder stone if US is negative.StrongAll patients with bladder stones should be examined and investigated for the cause of bladder stone formation, including:uroflowmetry and post-void residual;urine dipstick, pH, ± culture;metabolic assessment and stone analysis (see sections 3.3.2.3 and 4.1 of the Urolithiasis guidelines for further details).In selected patients, consider:upper tract imaging (in patients with a history of urolithiasis or loin pain);cysto-urethroscopy or urethrogram.WeakOffer oral chemolitholysis for radiolucent or known uric acid bladder stones in adults.WeakOffer adults with bladder stones transurethral cystolithotripsy where possible.StrongPerform transurethral cystolithotripsy with a continuous flow instrument in adults(e.g., nephroscope or resectoscope) where possible.WeakOffer adults percutaneous cystolithotripsy where transurethral cystolithotripsy is not possible or advisable.StrongSuggest open cystolithotomy as an option for very large bladder stones in adults and children.WeakOffer children with bladder stones transurethral cystolithotripsy where possible.WeakOffer children percutaneous cystolithotripsy where transurethral cystolithotripsy is not possible or is associated with a high risk of urethral stricture (e.g., young children, previous urethral reconstruction, and spinal cord injury).WeakOpen, laparoscopic, and extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy are alternative treatments where endoscopic treatment is not advisable in adults and children.WeakPrefer “tubeless” procedure (without placing a catheter or drain) for children with primary bladder stones and no prior infection, surgery, or bladder dysfunction where open cystolithotomy is indicated.WeakIndividualise imaging follow up for each patient as there is a paucity of evidence. Factors affecting follow up will include:whether the underlying functional predisposition to stone formation can be treated (e.g., TURP);metabolic risk.WeakRecommend regular irrigation therapy with saline solution to adults and children with bladder augmentation, continent cutaneous urinary reservoir or neuropathic bladder dysfunction, and no history of autonomic dysreflexia, to reduce the risk of stone recurrence.Weak
