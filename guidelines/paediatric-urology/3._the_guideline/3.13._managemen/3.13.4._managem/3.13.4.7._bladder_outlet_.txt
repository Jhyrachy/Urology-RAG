3.13.4.7. Bladder outlet procedures. No available medical treatment has been validated to increase bladder outlet resistance. Alpha-adrenergic receptor stimulation of the bladder neck has not been effective [760]. Using fascial slings with autologous fascial strip or artificial material a continence rate between 40-100% can be achieved. In most cases this is achieved in combination with bladder augmentation [848-853]. Catheterising through a reconstructed bladder neck or a urethra compressed by a sling may not be easy; many surgeons prefer to combine this approach with a catheterisable channel [706]. In contrast to the autologous slings, artificial slings in girls with CIC through the urethra have a high complication rate [854]. In males, it may be an option [855], however as long as long-term results are missing, this method has to be classified as experimental and should only be carried out in studies. Artificial urinary sphincters were introduced by Scott in 1973 [856]. The continence rates in the literature in selected patients can be up to 83% [857,858]. Post-pubertal patients, who can void voluntary are good candidates, if they are manually dexterous. In very selected patients, CIC through the sphincter in an augmented bladder is possible [858]. The erosion rate can be up to 29% and the revision rate up to 100% depending on the follow-up time [852]. Patients, who underwent a bladder neck procedure only, have a chance of > 30% for an augmentation and/or onabotulinum toxin A injections >30% later on; half of them developed new upper tract damage in that time [859-861]. In patients with a good bladder capacity and bladder compliance without an indication for bladder augmentation, up to 40% will need augmentation later on [860]. Therefore, close follow-up of these patients with UD is required to avoid upper tract damage and chronic renal failure. Bladder neck reconstruction is used mostly in exstrophy patients with acceptable results. However, in children with a neurogenic bladder the results are less favourable [862]. In most patients, the creation of a continent catheterisable stoma is necessary due to difficulties in performing the CIC via the urethra. In one series, 10% to a third still performed CIC via the urethra with a re-operation rates between 67% and 79% after a median follow-up between seven and ten years [863]. In patients who are still incontinent after a bladder outlet procedure, bladder neck closure with a continent catheterisable stoma is an option. The combination of a sling procedure together with a urethral lengthening procedure may improve the continence rates [864]. Bulking agents have a low success rate (10-40%), which is in most cases only temporary [865-867]. However, it does not adversely affect the outcome of further definite surgical procedures [865]. Bladder neck closure is often seen as the last resort to gain urinary continence in those patients with persistent urinary incontinence through the urethra. In girls, the transection is done between bladder neck and urethra and in boys above the prostate with preservation of the neurovascular bundle. It is an effective method to achieve continence together with a catheterisable cutaneous channel +/- augmentation as a primary or secondary procedure [868,869]. A complication rate of up to a third and a vesicourethral/vesicovaginal fistula in up to 15% should be considered [870], together with a higher risk for bladder stones, bladder perforation and deterioration of the upper tract function, if the patient is not compliant with CIC and bladder irrigations [870,871].
