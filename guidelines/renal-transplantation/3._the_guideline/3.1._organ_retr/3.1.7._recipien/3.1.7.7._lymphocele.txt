3.1.7.7. Lymphocele. Lymphocele is a relatively common (1-26%) complication [197]. There is a significant aetiological association with diabetes, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors (i.e sirolimus) therapy, and acute rejection [198]. For large and symptomatic lymphocele, laparoscopic fenestration is associated with the lowest overall recurrence (8%) and complication (14%) rate compared to open surgery and aspiration therapy [199]. Placement of a percutaneous drain (i.e. Pig-Tail) is an option with a success rate as high as 50% [163]. Percutaneous aspiration can be performed although the recurrence rate can be as high as 95% [199], with an increased risk of local infection (6-17%) [199]. Furthermore, sclerosant agents such as ethanol, fibrin sealant, gentamicin, or octreotide reduce the recurrence rate compared to simple aspiration [199,200].
