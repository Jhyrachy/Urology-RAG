9.2. Comparison of different types of flaps. Different local flaps have been described. Penile skin flaps are generally hairless, although the ventral penile skin can be hair-bearing around the raphe in some ethnic groups/phenotypes. They can be harvested as a transverse preputial skin flap [511], a transverse distal PSF [358,508,512,513] or as a longitudinal island flap [514]. Urethral patency rates vary between 74.2-100% [274,358,508,511-514]. Complications include skin necrosis (0-3.8%), fistula (0-7%), penile deformity (0-7%), post-void dribbling (0-79%) and sacculation (0-16.5%) (see supplementary Table S9.1). As there are no direct comparative series available about these flaps it is not possible to determine which performs better. Hair-bearing perineal and scrotal flaps have been described as well. Fu et al., demonstrated that PSF had a significantly better urethral patency rate compared to scrotal and perineal skin flaps (respectively 87.7%, 69% and 66.7%) [274]. The hair-bearing perineal and scrotal skin flaps are associated with hairball formation and chronic infection which may cause failure of the repair. A study of Blandy with long-term follow-up, reports 3% revision for calculi and 3% revision for diverticula [515]. An alternative is to epilate the needed scrotal skin prior to tissue transfer [516,517] or to patch an OMG to the underlying dartos tissue of the scrotum after incision of the scrotal skin and use this patch as a flap in a second attempt [442]. Summary of evidenceLEHair-bearing flaps have a lower urethral patency rate compared to non-hair-bearing flaps.3 RecommendationStrength ratingDo not use hair-bearing perineal or scrotal flaps unless no other option is feasible.Strong
