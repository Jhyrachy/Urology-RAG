3.4.15. Management of stones in children. The true incidence of nephrolithiasis in children remains unclear due to the global lack of large epidemiological studies. Data derived from nationwide epidemiological studies, studies performed in different counties worldwide [463] and large-scale databases [464,465] indicate that the incidence and prevalence of paediatric urinary stone disease have increased over the last few decades. Although boys are most commonly affected in the first decade of life [466] the greatest increase in incidence has been seen in older female adolescents [463]. Stone composition is similar in children as in adults, with a predominance of calcium oxalate stones. Compared to historical data, metabolic abnormalities responsible for stone formation are less commonly identified in children nowadays [467-469]. Hypocitraturia, low urine volume and hypercalciuria predominate [84,467-469]. Age may affect the predominant metabolic abnormality with hypercalciuria and hypocitraturia being the most common disorder present in children < 10 and > 10 years old, respectively [469]. Genetic or systemic diseases (e.g., cystinuria or nephrocalcinosis) contributing to stone formation are relatively frequent in children accounting for less than 17% of the identifying causes [467,470]. The role of diet remains unclear in children, although there is some evidence that children are drinking less water and taking greater daily amounts of sodium than is recommended [471-473]. For diagnostic procedures see Section 3.3.3.2, for acute decompression see Section 3.4.2. and for metabolic evaluation see Chapter 4. 3.4.15.1. Clinical presentation Children with urinary stones can be asymptomatic or present with non-specific symptoms that necessitate a high index of suspicion for proper diagnosis. Symptoms are age-dependent with infants presenting with crying, irritability and vomiting in 40% of cases [474] while in older children flank pain, micro or gross haematuria and recurrent UTIs are more common [475]. 3.4.15.2. Conservative management There is a lack of evidence on conservative management of paediatric stones with evidence for ureteric calculi coming from the placebo arms of medical expulsive trials, while evidence for renal stones comes from small cohort studies, either on primary stones [476,477] or residual fragments remained after SWL, RIRS or PCNL [478]. Expectant management for single, asymptomatic lower-pole renal stones could be the initial approach with increased odds of stone passage, especially in patients with non-struvite, non-cystine stones < 7 mm, with no anatomic abnormalities [476]. Intervention may be needed for stones located elsewhere independently of their size [476-478]. 3.4.15.3. Medical expulsive therapy in children There are limited studies on MET as off-label expulsive therapy for children with ureteral stones up to10 mm which show conflicting outcomes. Several systematic reviews and meta-analyses, including six RCTs and one conference abstract of an RCT, have been performed, all unanimously reporting that the use of alpha-blockers for distal ureteric stones increases the stone-free or stone expulsion rate [479-481]. The use of alpha-blockers also reduces the stone expulsion time and decreases pain episodes and analgesia demand with the disadvantage of more side-effects such as headache and nasal congestion [480,481]. 3.4.15.4. Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy Shock wave lithotripsy is still the first-line treatment for most ureteral stones in children. However, it is less likely to be successful for stones > 10 mm in diameter, impacted stones, calcium oxalate monohydrate or cystine stones, or for stones in children with unfavourable anatomy and in whom localisation is difficult [482]. Studies on extracorporeal SWL in children suggest an overall SFR of 70-90%, retreatment rate of 4-50% and need for auxiliary procedures in 4-12.5% of cases [483-487]. A MA of fourteen studies reporting on 1,842 paediatric patients treated with SWL found significantly higher SFR for stones < 10 mm than for stones > 10 mm and higher retreatment rates as the stone size increased [482]. For best clinical practice see Section 3.4.5. A MA on slow SWL vs. rapid SWL for renal stones revealed very low-quality evidence about the effects of SWL on SFRs, serious adverse events or complications of treatment and secondary procedures for residual fragments [479]. Shock wave lithotripsy is well tolerated; however, good treatment outcomes are more likely to require the administration of general anaesthesia to children. With improvements in modern (second and third-generation) lithotripters, successful treatment using intravenous sedation, patient-controlled analgesia or no medication at all has been increasingly performed in a select population of older, co-operative children [488]. Based on the results of a MA which compared SWL to dissolution therapy for intra-renal stones, and SWL to ureteroscopy with holmium laser or pneumatic lithotripsy for renal and distal ureteric stones, no firm conclusions can be drawn about the effects of SWL on SFR, serious adverse events or complications of treatment and secondary procedures for residual fragments [479]. When SWL was compared to mini-percutaneous nephrolithotomy for lower pole renal stones 1-2 cm in size SWL resulted in lower SFRs (RR: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.80 - 0.97; moderate-quality evidence) and higher rates of secondary procedures (RR: 2.50, 95% CI: 1.01 - 6.20; low-quality evidence); however, SWL showed less severe adverse events (RR: 0.13, 95% CI: 0.02 - 0.98; low-quality evidence) [489]. 3.4.15.5. Endourological procedures Rigid/semi-rigid ureteroscopyIn recent years ureteroscopy is increasingly used in children with ureteral stones [490]. Ureteroscopy proved to be effective with SFR of 81-98% [491-493], retreatment rates of 6.3%-10% [494] and complication rates of 1.9-23% [491-493,495]. Similar to adults, routine stenting is not necessary before URS. Pre-stenting may facilitate URS, increase SFR and decrease complication rates [496,497]. Flexible ureteroscopy/retrograde intrarenal surgeryRetrograde intra-renal surgery with flexible ureteroscopes (FURS) has become an efficacious treatment modality for paediatric renal stones. Studies report SFRs of 76-100%, retreatment rates of 0-19% and complication rates of 0-28% [498-501]. Younger age, cystine composition [502], large stone diameter [501] and lack of pre-stenting predispose to FURS failure in children [496]. A large global study across eight centres shows an SFR of 75.5%; although complications were minor, they were higher in patients < 5 years of age [503]. Although high-level evidence is lacking to support a strong recommendation [479], FURS may be a particularly effective treatment option for lower calyceal stones in the presence of unfavourable factors for SWL [493,499,504]. For large and complex kidney stones RIRS has a significantly lower SFR compared to PCNL (71% vs. 95%), but is associated with less radiation exposure, lower complication rates, and a shorter hospital stay [505]. Similarly, retrospective data indicate that RIRS may achieve lower SFRs compared to micro percutaneous surgery in favour of shorter operative time, shorter fluoroscopy time, and less hospitalisation time [506,507]. A published MA confirmed these results [508]. Percutaneous nephrolithotomyIndications for PCNL in children are like those in adults and include renal stones > 2 cm, or smaller stones resistant to SWL and ureteroscopic treatment. Reported SFRs with paediatric PCNL are 71.4-95% after a single session [505-507,509,510] with an overall complication rate of 20% [511]. A high degree of hydronephrosis, increased number of tracts and operative time [512], and large tract size [510,513-515] are associated with increased blood loss. Child age [514] and stone burden [510] predispose to the use of larger instruments during PCNL in children. The miniaturisation of equipment increases the opportunity to perform tubeless PCNL in appropriately selected children, which can reduce the length of hospital stay and post-operative pain [516,517]. A systematic review on the role of mini-PCNL showed an initial and overall SFR of 87.9% and 97% respectively, with no conversions to standard PCNL, and a complication rate of 19%, with a mean transfusion rate of 3.3% [503]. Concerns have been raised regarding the possible adverse effects of PCNL on the renal parenchyma of the developing child. However, focal damage is only reported in 5% of cases [518]. Using pre- and post-PCNL dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scans, Cicekbilek et al. demonstrated that PCNL tracts between 12-24 Charrière in size did not cause significant harm to paediatric kidneys [509]. 3.4.15.6. Open and laparoscopic/robot-assisted stone surgery With the advances in SWL, PCNL and RIRS, very few cases of paediatric urolithiasis require open surgery. Data extracted from the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) databases for 2001-2014 showed that in the USA incisional procedures (mainly nephrolithotomy, pyelolithotomy and ureterotomy) were performed in 2.6% of hospitalised patients (52% aged 15-17 years) who required surgical intervention for urinary stones [519]. Laparoscopy for the management of paediatric renal and ureteric stones is a safe and effective procedure when specific indications are followed. Stone-free rates of 100% were reported when laparoscopic pyelolithotomy was applied for a≥ 1 cm single stone located in an extra-renal pelvis [520], or when laparoscopic ureterolithotomy was applied to impacted ureteric stones ≥ 1.5 cm, or to ureteric stones that were refractory to SWL or URS [521]. There are extremely limited data available on the efficacy and complications of robot-assisted laparoscopic management of paediatric urolithiasis [522]. 3.4.15.7. Special considerations on recurrence prevention All paediatric stone formers need metabolic evaluation and recurrence prevention with respect to the detected stone type. Children are in the high-risk group for stone recurrence (See Chapter 4). 3.4.15.8.
