3.10.1. Epidemiology, aetiology and pathophysiology. Urinary tract infections (UTIs) represent the most common bacterial infections in children [453-455]. There are several classification systems used to define a UTI. In neonates, the symptoms differ in many aspects from those in infants and children. The prevalence is higher; there is a male predominance; infections caused by other organisms than Escherichia coli are more frequent; and there is a higher risk of urosepsis [456,457]. In children presenting with urinary symptoms a pooled prevalence of UTI was 7.8% (CI: 6.6-8.9) [456]. The incidence varies depending on age and sex. One meta-analysis showed that in children presenting with fever in the first three months of life UTIs were present in 7.5% of girls, 2.4% (CI: 1.4-3.5) of circumcised boys, and 20.1% (CI: 16.8-23.4) of uncircumcised boys [456]. The incidence for boys is highest during the first six months of life (5.3%) and decreases with age to around 2% for the ages 0-6 years. In girls, UTIs are less common during the first six months of life (2%) and incidence increases with age to around 11% for the ages 0-6 years [458]. Associated risk factors for recurrent UTIs include bladder and bowel dysfunction (BBD), vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) and obesity [459-461]. In older children a delay in treatment is more often seen than in younger infants [462]. These risk factors in combination with delay in treatment have been associated with renal scarring [463]. Recurrent febrile UTIs, especially in combination with high-grade VUR, lead to renal scarring [464,465]. Each new febrile UTI increases the risk of renal scarring with an incidence of renal scarring after the first UTI, of 2.8% (CI:1.2-5.8), 25.7% (CI:12.5-43.3) after the second infection and up to 28.6% (CI:8.4-58.1) after 3 or more febrile UTIs [465]. The leading causative organism for UTIs has been E. coli, but other bacteriae have been rising in prevalence. In a large European study E. Coli was found in less than 50% of urine cultures. Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter spp., Enterococcus spp., Pseudomonas spp., Proteus spp. and Candida spp. are more frequent in nosocomial infections than in community-acquired UTIs, even though, their prevalence has increased outside of the hospital setting [466]. Neonatal UTI is frequently complicated by bacteraemia. In a retrospective study, 12.4% of blood cultures from neonates admitted for UTI were positive for bacteraemia [467], however, it is less frequent in community-acquired than in nosocomial UTI [467,468].
