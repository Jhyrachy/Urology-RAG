7.1. Counselling of smoking cessation. It has been confirmed that smoking increases the risk of tumour recurrence and progression in NMIBC patients [239-241] as well as mortality in all BC patients [242].

Patients should be counselled to stop smoking due to the general health risks associated with tobacco smoking [229,243-245].
