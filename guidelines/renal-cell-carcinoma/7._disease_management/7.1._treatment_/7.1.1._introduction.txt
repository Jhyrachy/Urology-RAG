7.1.1. Introduction. Sections 7.1.2 and 7.2.4.2 are underpinned by a SR which includes all relevant published literature comparing surgical management of localised RCC (T1â€“2N0M0). Randomised or quasi-RCTs were included. However, due to the very limited number of RCTs, non-randomised studies (NRS), prospective observational studies with controls, retrospective matched-pair studies, and comparative studies from the databases of well-defined registries were also included. Historically, surgery has been the benchmark for the treatment of localised RCC.
