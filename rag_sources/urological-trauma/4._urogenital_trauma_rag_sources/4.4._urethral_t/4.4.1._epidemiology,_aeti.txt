4.4.1. epidemiology, aetiology pathophysiology. 4.4.1.1. anterior male urethral injury bulbar urethra common site affected blunt trauma. bulbar injuries, bulb compressed pubic symphysis, resulting rupture urethra site compression . possible mechanisms straddle injuries kicks perineum. penile fracture complicated urethral injury approximately 15% cases . penetrating anterior injuries rare usually caused gunshot wounds, stab wounds, dog bites, impalement, penile amputations . depending affected segment, penetrating injuries usually associated penile, testicular and/or pelvic injuries . insertion foreign bodies another rare cause anterior injury. usually result autoerotic stimulation may associated psychiatric disorders . iatrogenic injury common type urethral trauma . incidence male urethral injury transurethral catheterisation 13.4 per 1,000 catheters inserted . injuries occur due creation false passage tip catheter inadvertent inflation anchoring balloon urethra . importance catheter insertion training programmes implementation difficult urinary catheterisation protocols , prevent urethral injury transurethral catheterisation, demonstrated. preliminary data suggests guidewire led catheter insertion, use safety valve balloon inflation may prevent urethral trauma difficult catheterisation cases . sr use hydrophilic coated catheters, patients performing intermittent catheterization, showed clear benefit . penile prosthesis insertion, risk urethral perforation 0.1-4%. proximal urethral injuries common distal ones . 4.4.1.2. posterior male urethral injuries blunt posterior urethral injuries almost exclusively related pelvic fractures risk increases fracture configuration severity . injuries referred pelvic fracture urethral injuries (pfui) , mainly caused road traffic accidents . pelvic fracture urethral injuries divided partial complete ruptures . complete ruptures, gap disrupted ends urethra, fills scar tissue. urethral wall scarred space lumen represents fistulous tract urethral stumps . injuries bladder neck prostate rare mostly occur anterior midline bladder neck prostatic urethra . highly uncommon find complete transection bladder neck avulsion anterior part prostate . concomitant injuries head, thorax, abdomen and/or spine frequent (up 66%) . penetrating injuries pelvis, perineum, buttocks (mainly gunshot wounds) also damage posterior urethra extremely rare civilian setting . high probability associated injuries (approx. 90%), mainly intra-abdominal . associated injuries occur blunt penetrating posterior urethral injuries life-threatening, so, govern patient’s assessment treatment . delayed morbidities posterior urethral injuries include strictures, incontinence erectile dysfunction, may detrimental effect patient’s quality life . pooled estimate proportion patients erectile dysfunction following pifu 34% . iatrogenic injury reported transanal total mesorectal excision 1-11% cases. injury usually partial located membranous urethra . 4.4.1.3. female urethral injuries birth related injuries female urethra rare consist minor (peri)urethral lacerations vaginal delivery. pelvic fractures main cause blunt trauma ; however, pfuis females rare less common males . usually attributed flexibility provided vagina greater inherent elasticity female urethra , may also result less severe frequent stable pelvic fractures females . unstable pelvic fractures females, high suspicion urethral injury maintained . female urethral injuries classified two types: longitudinal partial (most frequent) injuries transverse complete injuries . concomitant bladder vaginal injury possible; therefore, females risk developing urinary incontinence urethrovaginal fistula . insertion synthetic sub-urethral sling treatment female stress urinary incontinence complicated intra-operative urethral injury 0.2-2.5% cases important cause iatrogenic urethral injury.
