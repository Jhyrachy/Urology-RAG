6.4.2. Medical management of bladder stones. There is a paucity of evidence on chemolitholysis of bladder stones. However, guidance on the medical management of urinary tract stones in section 3.4.9 Specific stone management of ureteral stones, can be applied to urinary stones in all locations. Uric acid stones can be dissolved by oral urinary alkalinisation when a PH > 6.5 is consistently achieved, typically using alkaline citrate or sodium bicarbonate. Regular monitoring is required during therapy (see section 3.4.4 Chemolysis). Irrigation chemolysis is also possible using a catheter; however, this is time-consuming may cause chemical cystitis and is therefore not commonly employed [734,735].
