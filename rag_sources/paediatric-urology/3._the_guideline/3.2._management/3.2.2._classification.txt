3.2.2. classification. term cryptorchidism often used synonymously undescended testes. useful classification undescended testes distinguishing palpable non-palpable testes, clinical management decided location presence testes (see figure 1). approximately 80% undescended testes palpable . acquired undescended testes caused entrapment herniorrhaphy spontaneously referred ascending testis. palpable testes include true undescended testes ectopic testes. non-palpable testes include intra-abdominal, inguinal, absent, sometimes also ectopic testes. importantly, diagnosis palpable non-palpable testis needs confirmed child general anaesthesia, first step surgical procedure undescended testes. figure 1: classification undescended testes 3.2.2.1. palpable testes undescended testes true undescended testis normal path descent halted way scrotum. depending location, testes may palpable not, case testes arrested inguinal canal. ectopic testes position testis outside normal path descent outside scrotum, testis considered ectopic. common aberrant position superficial inguinal pouch. sometimes ectopic testis identified femoral, perineal, pubic, penile even contralateral position. usually, possibility ectopic testis descend spontaneously correct position; therefore, requires surgical intervention. addition, ectopic testis might palpable due position. retractile testes retractile testes completed descent proper scrotal position found suprascrotal position along path normal descent. due overactive cremasteric reflex . retractile testes easily manipulated scrotum remain least temporarily. typically normal size consistency. however, may normal monitored carefully since one-third ascend become undescended . 3.2.2.2. non-palpable testes among 20% non-palpable testes, 50-60% intra-abdominal, canalicular peeping (right inside internal inguinal ring). remaining 20% absent 30% atrophic rudimentary. intra-abdominal testes intra-abdominal testes located different positions, found close internal inguinal ring. however, possible locations include kidney, anterior abdominal wall, retrovesical space. case open internal inguinal ring, testis may peeping inguinal canal. absent testes monorchidism identified 4% boys undescended testes, anorchidism (bilateral absence) < 1%. possible pathogenic mechanisms include testicular agenesis atrophy intrauterine torsion latter one probably due utero infarction normal testis gonadal vessel torsion. term “vanishing testis” commonly used condition .
