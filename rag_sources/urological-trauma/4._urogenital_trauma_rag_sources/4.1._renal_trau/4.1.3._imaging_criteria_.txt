4.1.3. imaging: criteria radiographic assessment. goals imaging grade renal injury, document pre-existing renal pathology, demonstrate presence contralateral kidney identify injuries organs. haemodynamic status determine initial imaging pathway unstable patients potentially requiring immediate intervention. majority patients moderate major trauma ct scan performed soon presentation. patients imaging indications renal imaging [31,48-51]: visible haematuria;non-visible haematuria one episode hypotension;a history rapid deceleration injury and/or significant associated injuries;penetrating trauma;clinical signs suggesting renal trauma e.g. flank pain, abrasions, fractured ribs, abdominal distension and/or mass tenderness. 4.1.3.1. computed tomography computed tomography imaging modality choice stable patients. quick, widely available, accurately identify grade renal injury , establish presence contralateral kidney demonstrate concurrent injuries organs. ideally performed three-phase study : arterial phase assesses vascular injury presence active extravasation contrast.the nephrographic phase optimally demonstrates parenchymal contusions lacerations.the delayed phase imaging (five minutes) identifies collecting system/ureteric injury. practice, trauma patients usually undergo standardised whole-body imaging protocols delayed phase imaging renal tract routinely performed. suspicion renal injuries fully evaluated, delayed phase imaging recommended. rates contrast-induced nephropathy seen trauma patients low . 4.1.3.2. ultrasonography (us) primary survey critically injured patient, fast (focused assessment sonography trauma) used identify hemoperitoneum cause haemorrhage hypovolemia. however, routinely used assessment solid organ injury insensitive, operator dependant, define injury well, inferior ct. option follow-up [55-57]. 4.1.3.3. imaging modalities 4.1.3.3.1. intravenous pyelography (ivp) intravenous pyelography radionuclide scans magnetic resonance imaging (mri) significant role trauma setting. quality one shot ivp generally poor. palpation contralateral (unaffected) kidney pragmatic surrogate function . diagnostic accuracy mri renal trauma similar ct . however, logistical challenges mri make modality impractical acute trauma.
