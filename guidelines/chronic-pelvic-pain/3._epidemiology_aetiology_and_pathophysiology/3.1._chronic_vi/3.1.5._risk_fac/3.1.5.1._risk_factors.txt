3.1.5.1. Risk factors. Risk factors include many different factors from various areas, including genetic, psychological state, recurrent physical trauma and endocrine factors. The endocrine system is involved in visceral function. Significant life events, and in particular, early life events may alter the development of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the chemicals released. Increased vulnerability to stress is thought to be partly due to increased corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) gene expression. Up-regulation of CRH has been implicated in several pain states such as rectal hypersensitivity to rectal distension [27]. This model suggests an action of CRH on mast cells. A range of stress-related illnesses have been suggested, e.g., IBS and BPS [28,29]. There is evidence accumulating to suggest that the sex hormones also modulate both nociception and pain perception [30]. Stress can also produce long-term biological changes which may form the relation between chronic pain syndromes and significant early life and adverse life events [31]. Asking the patient about these events is important as they have an effect on a patient’s psychological wellbeing [32,33]. Genetics also play a role in assessing the risk of developing chronic pain. An individual who has one chronic pain syndrome is more likely to develop another. Family clusters of pain conditions are also observed and animals can be bred to be more prone to apparent chronic pain state. A range of genetic variations have been described that may explain the pain in certain cases; many of these are to do with subtle changes in transmitters and their receptors. However, the picture is more complicated in that developmental, environmental and social factors also influence the situation. Evidence that primary bladder pain syndrome (PBPS) may have a genetic component has been presented in several identical twin studies, but genetics may contribute to less than one third of total variation in susceptibility to PBPS [34,35]. Studies about integrating the psychological factors of CPPPSs are few but the quality is high. Psychological factors are consistently found to be relevant in the maintenance of persistent pelvic and urogenital pain [36]. Beliefs about pain contribute to the experience of pain [37] and symptom-related anxiety and central pain amplification may be measurably linked, and worrying about pain and perceived stress predict worsening of urological chronic pain over a year [36,38]. Central sensitisation has been demonstrated in a small study of symptomatic endometriosis [39] and central changes are evident in association with dysmenorrhoea and increasingly recognised as a risk for female pelvic pain [40]. The various mechanisms of CNS facilitation, amplification and failure of inhibition mean that there is no simple relationship between physical findings, pain experience and resulting distress and restriction of activities. Division of aetiology into organic vs. psychogenic is unscientific. Diagnoses that assign women’s pain to psychological origins due to scepticism about the reality or severity of their pain [23,41] undermines any therapeutic relationship [42]. Pelvic pain and distress is related [43] in both men and women [44]; as are painful bladder and distress [38]. In a large population based study of men, CPPPS was associated with prior anxiety disorder [45]. The only SR [46] of risk factors for chronic non-cyclical pelvic pain in women included, as well as medical variables: sexual or physical abuse (Odds Ratio (OR): 1.51-3.49); psychological problems such as anxiety (OR: 2.28; 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.41-3.70) and depression (OR: 2.69; 95% CI: 1.86-3.88); multiple somatic problems (OR: 4.83; 95% CI: 2.50-9.33 and OR: 8.01; 95% CI: 5.16-12.44). Many studies have reported high rates of childhood sexual abuse in adults with persistent pain, particularly in women with pelvic pain [47]. It is hard to establish a causal role for sexual abuse or trauma history, anxiety or depression in women with CPPPS [48,49], as the attribution of current pain to past sexual or physical abuse is associated both with current depression [50] and with current overall physical health [51]. There is some evidence for a specific relationship between rape and CPPPS (and with fibromyalgia and functional gastrointestinal disorders) [52]; and, recent sexual assault may prompt presentation of pelvic pain [47,53]. Few studies have been found of sexual or physical abuse in childhood and pelvic pain in men, although it has known adverse effects on health [52], but men who reported having experienced sexual, physical or emotional abuse had increased odds (3.3 vs. 1.7) for symptoms suggestive of CPPPS [54]. Both sexes should be screened for sexual abuse when presenting with symptoms suggestive of CPPPS, and clinicians should inquire about pelvic pain in patients who have experienced abuse [54].
