6.2.3.1.4. Neoadjuvant or adjuvant hormone therapy plus radiotherapy. The combination of RT with luteinising hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) ADT has superiority compared with RT alone followed by deferred ADT on relapse, as shown by phase III RCTs [675-685] (Table 6.1.9). The main message is that for intermediate-risk disease a short duration of four to six months is optimal while a longer one, 2-3 years, is needed for high-risk patients. The largest RCT in intermediate risk disease comparing dose escalated RT with or without six months of ADT failed to demonstrate an OS advantage with a median follow-up time of 6.3 years. Six months of ADT use was associated with reduced PSA failure, fewer distant metastases and improved prostate cancer specific mortality [685].

The question of the added value of EBRT combined with ADT has been clarified by 3 RCTs. All showed a clear benefit of adding EBRT to long-term ADT (Table 6.1.10).
