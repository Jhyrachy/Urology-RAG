6.3. Predictive markers. 6.3.1. Clinical and histopathological markers Based on retrospective data only, patients with secondary MIBC have a worse response to NAC compared to patients with primary MIBC [225]. Pietzak et al., retrospectively analysed clinico-pathologic outcomes comparing 245 patients with clinical T2–4a N0M0 primary MIBC and 43 patients with secondary MIBC treated with NAC and RC. They found that patients with secondary MIBC had lower pathologic response rates following NAC than those with primary MIBC (univariable 26% vs. 45%, multivariable OR: 0.4 [95% CI: 0.18–0.84, p = 0.02]). They also found that MIBC patients progressing after NAC had worse CSS as compared to patients treated with cystectomy alone (p = 0.002). Subtypes and non-UC have also been linked to worse outcomes after NAC, but there is, as yet, insufficient data to conclude that they can be considered as predictive markers [226]. 6.3.2. Molecular markers Several predictive biomarkers have been investigated such as serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) [227], circulating tumour cells, immune and stromal signatures, as well as expression of or defects in DNA damage repair (DDR) genes including ERCC2, ATM, MRE11, RB1 and FANCC that may predict response to cisplatin-based NAC [228,229] or chemoradiation [230-233]. More recently, alterations in FGFR2/3 including both mutations and gene fusions have been shown to be associated with response to FGFR inhibitors [234,235]. More recent efforts have focused on markers for predicting response to immune checkpoint inhibition. Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression by immunohistochemistry has been evaluated in several studies with mixed results which may in part be related to the use of different antibodies and various scoring systems evaluating different compartments, i.e., tumour cells, immune cells, or both. The major limitation of PD-L1 staining relates to the significant proportion of PD-L1-negative patients that respond to immune checkpoint blockade. For example, in the IMvigor 210 phase II study of atezolizumab in patients with advanced/metastatic UC who progressed after platinum-based chemotherapy, responses were seen in 18% of patients with low/no PD-L1 expression [236]. At present, the only indication for PD-L1 testing relates to the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors as monotherapy in patients with locally-advanced or metastatic UC unfit for cisplatin-containing chemotherapy who have not received prior therapy. In this setting, atezolizumab (the European Medicines Agency [EMA] approval) or pembrolizumab (EMA approval) should only be used in patients unfit for cisplatin-containing chemotherapy whose tumours overexpress PD-L1 (i.e., in case of atezolizumab; tumour-infiltrating immune cells [IC] covering ≥ 5% of the tumour area using the SP142 assay; in case of pembrolizumab, a combined positive score (CPS) of ≥ 10 using the Dako 22C33 platform) [237]. The FDA revised the label for pembrolizumab in patients with advanced UC with approval in first line only for patients not eligible for any platinum-based chemotherapy, however, irrespective of PD-L1 status. Urothelial cancer is associated with a high tumour mutational burden (TMB) [238]. Both predicted neoantigen burden and TMB have been associated with response to immune checkpoint blockade in several malignancies. High TMB has been associated with response to immune checkpoint inhibitors in metastatic BC [236,239]. Conflicting results have been seen in studies evaluating immune checkpoint inhibitors in the neoadjuvant setting with the Pembrolizumab as Neoadjuvant Therapy Before Radical Cystectomy in Patients With Muscle- Invasive Urothelial Bladder Carcinoma (PURE)-01 study demonstrating an association of high TMB with response while there was no association with atezolizumab in the Phase II study investigating the safety and efficacy of neoadjuvant atezolizumab in MIBC (ABACUS) [240,241]. Other markers that have been evaluated in predicting response to immune checkpoint inhibitors include molecular subtypes as discussed earlier, CD8 expression by immunohistochemistry and other immune gene cell signatures. Recent work has focused on the importance of stroma including the role of transforming growth factors (TGFs) in predicting response to immune checkpoint blockade [242,243]. Powles et al., have reported on the potential for ctDNA to guide the use of adjuvant IO in UC [244]. In 581 patients from a phase III RCT of adjuvant atezolizumab vs. observation in UC, ctDNA testing at the start of therapy identified 214 (37%) patients who were positive for ctDNA and who had poor prognosis (observation arm HR = 6.3, 95% CI: 4.45–8.92; p < 0.0001). Patients who were positive for ctDNA had improved DFS and OS in the atezolizumab arm vs. the observation arm (DFS: HR = 0.58 [95% CI: 0.43–0.79]; p = 0.0024, OS: HR = 0.59 [95% CI: 0.41–0.86]). There was no difference in DFS or OS between treatment arms for patients who were negative for ctDNA. The rate of ctDNA clearance at week 6 was higher in the atezolizumab arm (18%) than in the observation arm (4%) (p = 0.0204). An ongoing clinical trial (IMvigor011) is evaluating atezolizumab as adjuvant therapy in patients with high-risk MIBC who are ctDNA positive following cystectomy [245]. A exploratory analysis in patients with metastatic UC who received pembrolizumab in the first-line (KEYNOTE-052 trial) and salvage (KEYNOTE-045 trial) settings, demonstrated that TMB and T-cell inflammed gene expression profile were significantly associated with improved outcomes, however PD-L1 was associated with improved outcomes and stromal signature with worse outcomes in KEYNOTE-052, but not KEYNOTE-045 suggesting that these biomarkers may perform differently in different clinical disease states i.e. first line versus salvage settings [246]. In a second study, a scoring system (CPT) based on CD39, PD-L1 and TMB was shown to predict response to PD-L1 blockade and platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with MIBC [247]. Although promising, there are currently no validated predictive molecular markers that are routinely used in clinical practice. Further validation studies are awaited.
