8.2.3.2.1. Tunical shortening procedures. Tunical shortening procedures achieve straightening of the penis by shortening the longer, convex side of the penis. For men with good erectile function, adequate penile length, without complex deformities, such as an hourglass or hinge type narrowing abnormalities, and non-severe curvature, a tunical shortening procedure can be considered an appropriate surgical approach. Numerous different techniques have been described, although they can be classified as excisional, incisional and plication techniques. The Nesbit procedure operation is based on an elliptical excision of tunica albuginea opposite to the point of maximum curvature [977,978]. The Yachia technique is based on a completely different concept, as it utilises the Heinke-Mikowitz principle for which a longitudinal tunical incision is closed transversely to shorten the convex side of the penis. This technique, initially described by Lemberger in 1984, was popularised by Yachia in 1990, when he reported a series of 10 cases [979-984]. Pure plication techniques are simpler to perform. They are based on single or multiple plications performed without making excisions or incisions on the tunical albuginea, to limit the potential damage to the veno-occlusive mechanism [874,985-1001]. Another modification described the ’16-dot’ technique that consists of the application of two pairs of parallel Essed-Schroeder plications tensioned more or less depending on the degree of curvature [1002-1005]. Results and satisfaction rates are similar to both incision/excision techniques. In general, using these tunical shortening techniques, complete penile straightening is achieved in > 85% of patients. Recurrence of the curvature and penile hypo-aesthesia is uncommon (~10%) and the risk of post-operative ED is low. Penile shortening is the most commonly reported adverse outcome of these procedures. Shortening of 1-1.5 cm has been reported for 22-69% of patients, which is rarely the cause of post-operative sexual dysfunction and patients may perceive the loss of length as greater than it actually is. It is therefore strongly advisable to measure and document the penile length peri-operatively, both before and after the straightening procedure, whichever technique is used (Table 19). As mentioned above, there are multiple techniques with small modifications and all of them have been reported in retrospective studies, most of them without appropriate comparison between techniques and therefore the level of evidence is not sufficient to recommend one particular method over another.
