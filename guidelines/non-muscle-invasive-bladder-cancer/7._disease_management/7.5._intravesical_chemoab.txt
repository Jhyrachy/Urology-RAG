7.5. Intravesical chemoablation and neoadjuvant treatment. Two different modalities of administering chemotherapy as first-line approach for a presumed NMIBC have been reported: neoadjuvant intravesical chemotherapy before TURB or chemoresection of the tumour as a replacement of TURB. Neoadjuvant Hypothesis-generating findings from an older RCT comparing immediate pre-operative device-assisted (EMDA) MMC with post-operative SI with MMC and TURB only, showed improved long-term RFS among patients treated prior to TURB [371], and thus even suggest a long-term effect after neoadjuvant instillations. While this has not been reproduced by other groups, two recent small neoadjuvant RCTs have reported conflicting results on the ability of neoadjuvant administration of MMC to improve outcomes over the standard approach [372,373]. Chemoablation Older marker lesion studies have shown that chemoablation with a single intravesical chemotherapy instillation can achieve a complete response in a proportion of patients [374]; therefore, making it possible to avoid TURB. In recurrent low-grade [375] and recurrent Ta tumours [376], 4 and 6 intravesical MMC instillations achieved complete response in 37% and 57% of the patients, respectively. In an update of the DaBlaCa-13 RCT evaluating chemoablation with 40 mg/40 mL of intravesical MMC three times a week for 2 weeks without preceding biopsy to standard TURB, the 12-month RFS was 36% in the chemoablation group vs. 43% in the TURB group, with no statistical significant difference [376]. Despite the lack of long-term outcomes, chemoablation appears to be a promising treatment option for well-selected NMIBC patients and can potentially help avoid unnecessary TURB, specifically in some elderly patients with intermediate-risk NMIBC [377].
