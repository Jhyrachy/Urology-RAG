6.1.2.2. The use of intra-operative frozen section assessment. The role of frozen section and its value in the interpretation of excision margins remains uncertain, potential benefits of adopting frozen section assessment include a decreased risk of local recurrence and a smaller safety margin, allowing maximum preservation of penile tissue. A study in 169 patients treated in a tertiary referral centre in the UK showed that frozen section use during organ-sparing surgery contributed to a very low definitive positive margin rate of 0.6% and a local recurrence rate of 5.3% [152,153]. These data, however, are contradicted by a large contemporary series, also from a tertiary referral centre in the UK, showing similarly low local recurrence rates of 4% without routine intra-operative frozen section analysis [151]. A SR conducted in 2017 stated that routine frozen section analysis results in lower rates of local recurrence but failed to correct for patient selection, and hence a causal relationship between frozen section analysis and low local recurrence rates is lacking, as is comparative research. Data from one multi-centre study suggests that differentiated PeIN, squamous hyperplasia and lichen sclerosis present at the surgical margins are frequent findings and are not relevant for CSS [77]. As negative surgical margins are aimed for, in cases of doubt on the radicality of the resection, it is the Panelâ€™s opinion that frozen section analysis is a helpful tool to achieve definitive tumour-free margins, whereas it is not recommended to be used routinely.
