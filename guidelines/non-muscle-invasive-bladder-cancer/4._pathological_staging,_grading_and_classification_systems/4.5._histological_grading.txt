4.5. Histological grading of non-muscle-invasive bladder urothelial carcinomas. 4.5.1. Types of histological grading systems In 2004 the WHO published a histological classification system for UCs including papillary urothelial neoplasm of low malignant potential (PUNLMP), non-invasive papillary carcinoma low grade (LG) and HG. This system was also taken into the updated 2016/2022 WHO classifications [50,51]. It provides a different patient stratification between individual categories compared to the older 1973 WHO classification, which distinguished between grade 1 (G1), grade 2 (G2) and grade 3 (G3) categories [52,59]. There is a significant shift of patients between the categories of the WHO 1973 and the WHO 2004/2022 systems (see Figure 4.1), for example an increase in the number of HG patients (WHO 2004/2022) due to inclusion of a subset of G2 patients with a more favourable prognosis compared to the G3 category (WHO 1973) [60,61]. According to a multi-institutional individual patient data analysis, the proportion of tumours classified as PUNLMP (WHO 2004/2016) has decreased to very low levels in the last decade [62]. 4.5.2. Prognostic value of histological grading A systematic review and meta-analysis did not show that the 2004/2016 classification outperforms the 1973 classification in prediction of recurrence and progression [60]. To compare the prognostic value of both WHO classifications, an individual patient data analysis of 5,145 primary TaT1 NMIBC patients from sixteen centres throughout Europe and one in Canada was conducted. Patients had a transurethral resection of bladder tumour (TURBT) followed by intravesical instillations at the physician’s discretion. In this large study, the WHO 1973 and the WHO 2004/2016 were both prognostic for progression but not for recurrence. When compared, the WHO 1973 was a stronger prognosticator of progression in TaT1 NMIBC than the WHO 2004/2016. However, a 3-tier (LG/G1-G2, HG/G2 & HG/G3) or a 4-tier hybrid combination LG/G1, LG/G2, HG/G2 and HG/G3) of both classification systems proved to be superior to either classification system alone, as it divides the large group of G2 patients into two subgroups (LG/HG) with different prognoses [63]. In a subgroup of 3,311 patients with primary Ta bladder tumours, a similar prognosis was found for PUNLMP and Ta LG carcinomas [62]. 4.5.3. Clinical application of histological grading systems The WHO 2004/2022 classification system is currently supported by the WHO for clinical application. Nevertheless, the WHO 1973 is still being used.The most important parameters, which must be considered for clinical application of any grading system are its inter-observer reproducibility and prognostic value (see Sections 4.5.1 and 4.6).These guidelines provide recommendations for tumours classified by both classification systems. Figure 4.1: Schematic representation of tumours according to grade in the WHO 1973 and 2004/2022 classifications [63]**Grade shifts from the WHO 1973 (G1–G3) to the WHO 2004/2022 (PUNLMP, LG and HG) classification for Ta/T1 bladder tumours are displayed with dotted lines and arrows. Along the dotted lines, both the degree of anaplasia and the 5-year progression rates increased in LG/G1, LG/G2, HG/G2, and HG/G3 patients. Note: the 2004/2022 WHO classification is the updated version of 2004/2016 WHO classification. According to a series of 5145 primary Ta-T1 patients, the distribution of G1, G2 and G3 in the WHO 1973 classification is 23.5, 49.3 and 27.2% respectively while the corresponding PUNLMP, LG and HG rates for the WHO 2004/2022 system are 1.5, 49.8 and 48,7% respectively .
