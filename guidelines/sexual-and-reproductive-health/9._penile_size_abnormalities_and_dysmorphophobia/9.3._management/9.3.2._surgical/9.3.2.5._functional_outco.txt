9.3.2.5. Functional outcomes: sexual function, sensitivity, impact on quality of life and emotional adjustment. Cosmetic treatments, including surgery, help to restore self-esteem, reduce anxiety, social phobia, and depressive mood states regarding body concerns, and increase individuals’ well-being and QoL [1123,1124]. Therefore, we can expect men with genuine short penis to use available resources to adjust the length or girth of their penis as a mean to improve their sense of identity and fit cultural standards regarding penile size and function. Currently, the results of penile augmentation techniques seem mixed. The utilization of fillers led to enhanced genital self-image and self-esteem, as well as reduced symptoms of PDD. However, no effects were observed in terms of self-confidence or satisfaction with sexual relationship [1257]. Likewise, penile lengthening or girth enhancement surgery seem to result in poor satisfaction, poor erectile function and sensitivity in men with normal penis size [1134]. Despite those negative outcomes, cases of increased satisfaction have been registered [1330]. Male genital self-image has been related to IIEF domains: sexual desire, orgasmic and erectile function, intercourse and overall satisfaction [1247]. Similarly, perceived penis size seems to predict erectile function more than objective size [1130]. In addition, reduced penetrative and receptive oral sex is associated with men’s dissatisfaction regarding their penis [1331]. For these reasons, more efforts should be made in order to clarify the impact of penile augmentation treatments on men’s and partners’ well-being and QoL. As for men with BDD, they have shown reduced erectile and orgasmic function, as well as less intercourse satisfaction as compared with controls, while men with SPA revealed reduced satisfaction. Sexual desire seemed untouched in BDD and SPA cases [1257,1332].
