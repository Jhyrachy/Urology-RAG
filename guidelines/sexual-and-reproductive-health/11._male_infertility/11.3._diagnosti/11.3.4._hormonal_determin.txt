11.3.4. Hormonal determinations. In men with testicular deficiency, hypergonadotropic hypogonadism (also called primary hypogonadism) is usually present, with high levels of FSH and LH and, with or without low levels of testosterone. Generally, the levels of FSH negatively correlate with the number of spermatogonia [1578]. When spermatogonia are absent or markedly diminished, FSH level is usually elevated; when the number of spermatogonia is normal, but maturation arrest exists at the spermatocyte or spermatid level, FSH level is usually within the normal range [1578]. However, for patients undergoing TESE, FSH levels do not accurately predict the presence of spermatogenesis, as men with maturation arrest on histology can have both normal FSH and testicular volume [1579,1580]. Furthermore, men with NOA and high levels of FSH may still harbour focal areas of spermatogenesis at the time of TESE or microdissection TESE (mTESE) [1580,1581]. Despite current findings need to be confirmed, growing data suggest that lower preoperative serum anti-MÃ¼llerian hormone (AMH) levels are associated with higher likelihood of positive sperm retrieval outcomes in men undergoing mTESE[1582,1583].
