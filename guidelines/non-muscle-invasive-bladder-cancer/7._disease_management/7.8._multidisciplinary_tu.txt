7.8. Multidisciplinary tumour board. A multidisciplinary tumour board (MDT) approach including reassessment of radiology and pathology is associated with a changed treatment plan in up to 44% of BC patients [390-393], such as refraining from or recommending cystectomy in 7% of stage T1 patients [391-393], often as a result of the pathologic review [68,392]. Thus, patients with high-risk and very high-risk NMIBC will especially benefit from MDT discussion and such an approach is recommended for these patients. Figure 7.1 presents a treatment flow chart based on risk category, which may guide management of an individual patient.
