9.3.2.3. Surgical treatment of acquired penile shortness. 9.3.2.3.1. Penile prosthesis implantation (PPI) The literature fails to show a direct relationship between PPI and penile length in men with ED and no concomitant PD. In a study by Deveci et al., SPL was evaluated in men undergoing primary implant surgery due to diabetes or RP [1286]. Either three-piece (Alpha-1, Mentor, USA) and two-piece implants (Ambicor, AMS, Boston Scientific, USA) were used and most patients (72%) reported a subjective decrease in penile length, although no statistically significant difference was demonstrated in measured SPL [1286]. In another study, 45 patients with PD with no deformity or penile curvature < 30° or severe penile fibrosis/scarring were implanted with an AMS 700 LGX [1287]. The mean stretched penile length improved from 13.1 ± 1.2 cm to 13.7 ± 1.1 cm and 14.2 ± 1.2 cm at six and twelve months, respectively. A significant difference was also observed in the length of the stretched flaccid penis between six and twelve months [1287]. Some authors have evaluated the erect penile length following PPI. In a prospective study where patients with PD were excluded, erect penile length was compared from baseline achieved by intracavernosal injection and after PPI inflation. The authors demonstrated that there were 0.83 ± 0.25, 0.75 ± 0.20 and 0.74 ± 0.15 cm decreases in erect penile length six weeks, six months, and one year post-operatively, respectively [1288]. A study where patients with PD were excluded confirmed these results as the median pre-operative pharmacologically induced length (14.25 ± 2 cm) was decreased to median post-prosthesis penile length (13.5 ± 2.13 cm) [1289]. 9.3.2.3.2. Penile disassembly Penile disassembly has been described as a technique for penile lengthening [1290]. It consists of the separation of the penis into its anatomical components and the insertion of autologous cartilage in the space created between the glans cap and the tip of corpora cavernosa. Perovic et al., in a study with 19 patients submitted to penile disassembly and implantation of autologous rib cartilage followed by VED therapy, reported an increase of 3 cm and 3.1 cm in SPL and erect length, respectively [1290]. The results of this surgery are poorly documented and significant complications such as glans necrosis can ensue. 9.3.2.3.3. Lengthening corporal manoeuvres Penile length restoration with the use of the sliding technique (ST) and concomitant PPI was first described in a small series of three patients in 2012, and further supported by a larger series of 28-patient in a multi-centre study in 2015 [1110,1114]. Although this technique is only used in cases of end-stage PD with severe shortening of the shaft, 95% of men were satisfied with their increase in length with an average penile lengthening of 3.2 cm (range, 2.5-4 cm). The modified sliding technique (MoST) and multiple slit technique (MuST) are further modifications of the original ST [1111,1112]. In a series by Egydio et al., 143 patients with penile shortening and narrowing due to PD amongst other aetiologies underwent MoST or MuST procedures. The mean (range) penile length gain was 3.1 (2-7) cm at a median (range) follow-up of 9.7 (6-18) months [1111]. 9.3.2.3.4. Total phallic reconstruction (TPR) Radial forearm free flap is the most used reconstructive approach for TPR. In a single-centre study, Falcone et al., reported their experience of ten patients who underwent TPR using RAFFF after traumatic penile loss [1291]. In six individuals, the urethral stump was sufficient for primary anastomosis and neourethra formation. The remaining patients had total penile avulsion and were voiding via a perineal urethrostomy. Consequently, a two-stage urethroplasty was necessary. Two patients developed an acute arterial thrombosis of the microsurgical anastomosis, which was successfully treated with emergency exploration. One patient had a neourethral stricture and fistula that required revision. All patients who underwent complete urethral repair were able to void and ejaculate through the phallus. After a median follow-up of 51 months, all patients were satisfied with the acquired size, cosmesis, and sensation. Six patients received a PPI and were able to also engage in penetrative intercourses. However, three patients had revision surgery (two due to infection and one due to mechanical failure) [1291]. 9.3.2.3.5. Summary of evidence and recommendations for surgical treatment of acquired penile shortness Summary of evidenceLEPenile prosthesis implantation is not effective in increasing penile length.3The evidence for the use of penile disassembly manoeuvres and the lengthening corporal manoeuvres are limited.3Total phallic reconstruction yields to satisfactory outcomes despite the high incidence of post-operative complications.3 RecommendationsStrength ratingDo not recommend penile prosthesis implantation, penile disassembly or lengthening corporal manoeuvres to patients seeking penile lengthening options.StrongUse total phallic reconstruction to restore genital anatomy in genetic males with penile inadequacy due to traumatic loss.Weak
