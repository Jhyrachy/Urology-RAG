6.3.1. Treatment evaluation. Response to treatment should be assessed after the initial induction cycle by repeat imagining and/or re-evaluation of tumour markers. With marker decline and/or radiologically regressing or stable tumour features, the planned chemotherapy should be completed [192,194]. If markers decline, but metastases progress on imaging, induction therapy must be completed [195]. If markers have normalised and masses with features of post-pubertal teratoma progress early surgical resection should be considered. Slow marker-decline with the initial one to two cycles of chemotherapy warrants consideration for dose intensification (see https://www.gustaveroussy.fr/calculation-tumor/NSGCT.html). Following completion of treatment, cases with a low-level β-hCG plateau should be observed to determine whether complete normalisation subsequently occurs. In patients with a low plateau serum AFP level after chemotherapy, removal of residual masses should be undertaken, with subsequent AFP monitoring. Preoperative AFP levels of > 30 μg/l and viable cancer found in the histological examination of the resected specimen have been described as predictors of relapse after first line chemotherapy [196]. Salvage chemotherapy is thus only indicated for documented marker progression [195,197].
