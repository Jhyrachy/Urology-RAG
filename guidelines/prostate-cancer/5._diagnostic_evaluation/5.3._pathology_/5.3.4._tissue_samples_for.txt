5.3.4. Tissue samples for homologous recombination repair (HRR)-testing. Homologous recombination repair-testing in the PROfound trial was conducted on archival or recent biopsy tissue from primary or metastatic disease with successful sequencing in 69% [248]. Alterations in HRR genes are relatively unchanged comparing matched treatment-na√Øve diagnostic and mCRPC biopsies [249,250]. Whereas there is no preference for use of archival or new metastatic biopsies for HRR-testing, bone biopsies might be associated with lower success rates related to decalcification of tissue [251]. Testing of circulating tumour DNA might be a good alternative if tumour tissue is not available [250,252]. With tissue as reference, ctDNA showed 81% positive and 92% negative percentage agreement [253].
