3.3. general management principals. 3.3.1. initial evaluation initial emergency assessment trauma patient beyond focus guidelines. usually carried emergency medicine trauma specialised personnel following advanced trauma life support (atls) principles. detailed assessment involves cross-sectional imaging, laboratory analysis specialist surgical input. management individual organ injury follow sections below. tetanus vaccine status assessed penetrating injuries. 3.3.2. polytrauma managed major trauma centres leads improved survival urological trauma often associated significant injuries polytraumatised patient . lessons civilian trauma networks, military conflict, mass casualty events led many advances trauma care [14-16]. include widespread acceptance damage control principles trauma centralisation major trauma centres staffed dedicated trauma teams. re-organisation care centres shown reduce mortality 25% length stay four days . urologists increasingly understand role context polytrauma ultimate aims improving survivability decreasing morbidity patients. 3.3.3. damage control damage control life-saving strategy severely injured patients recognises consequences lethal triad trauma - hypothermia, coagulopathy, acidosis [17-19]. first three phased approach consists rapid control haemorrhage wound contamination. second phase involves resuscitation intensive care unit (icu), goal restoring normal temperature, coagulation, tissue oxygenation. final stage involves definitive surgery time-consuming reconstructive procedures performed stabilised patient . urological intervention needs mindful phase management. temporary abbreviated measures followed later definitive surgery required. complex reconstructive procedures, including organ preservation, undertaken. decision enter damage control mode taken lead trauma clinician following team discussion. urological examples include haemodynamically unstable patients due suspected renal haemorrhage pelvic fracture associated urethral bladder injury. options abdominal packing temporary urinary drainage ureteric, bladder urethral catheterisation valuable adjuncts care. 3.3.4. mass casualty events triage mass casualty event one number injured people severity injuries exceed capacity facility staff . triage, communication, preparedness important components successful response. triage mass casualty events involves difficult moral ethical considerations. disaster triage requires differentiation critically injured individuals saved immediate intervention many others non-life-threatening injuries treatment delayed whose injuries severe survival unlikely circumstances . 3.3.5. role thromboprophylaxis bed rest trauma patients high risk deep venous thrombosis (dvt). concerns secondary haemorrhage result prolonged post-injury bed rest dvt effectively compounds risk. established prophylaxis measures reduce thrombosis recommended following systemic review . however, strength evidence high yet evidence suggest mortality pulmonary embolism risk reduced . compression stockings low molecular weight heparins favoured. risk secondary haemorrhage isolated renal trauma low practice strict bed rest waned patients able mobilise . 3.3.6. antibiotic stewardship single shot antibiotic doses common major trauma. indication continuing antibiotics governed injury grade, associated injuries need intervention. patients urinary extravasation tend kept antibiotics evidence base this. antibiotics avoided lesser trauma e.g. grade 1-3 renal trauma, regular review undertaken continued antibiotics. 3.3.7. urinary catheterisation prolonged catheterisation required forms bladder urethral injury. catheterisation necessary stable patients low-grade renal injury. patients heavy haematuria, require monitoring ureteric stenting, benefit catheterisation. removed haematuria lightens improvement clinical situation. shortest possible period catheterisation advised.
