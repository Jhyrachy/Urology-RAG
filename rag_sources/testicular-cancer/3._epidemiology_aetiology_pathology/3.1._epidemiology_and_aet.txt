3.1. epidemiology aetiology. testicular cancer represents 1% adult neoplasms 5% urological tumours, three ten new cases per 100,000 males/per year western societies . incidence tc increased recent decades, predominantly industrialised countries [5-8], continues rise. diagnosis, 1-2% bilateral 90-95% cases germ cell tumours (gct) . peak incidence third decade life non-seminomatous germ cell tumour (nsgct) mixed gct patients, fourth decade seminoma testis (st) patients. 5% gct patients, primary site extragonadal location . two fundamental categories gcts based development epigenetic features. malignant post-pubertal gcts originate germ cell neoplasia “in situ” (gcnis). histologically clinically, subdivided seminomas non-seminomas, latter encompassing somatic extra-embryonal elements embryonal carcinoma, yolk sac, choriocarcinoma post-pubertal teratoma . non gcnis derived tumours include pre-pubertal type teratoma yolk sac tumour, occur early childhood, spermatocytic tumours usually occurs older men. although overlapping histology pre-pubertal type teratoma/yolk sac teratoma yolk sac tumour elements gcnis-derived nsgct, separate independent pathogenesis . risk factors gcnis-derived gcts components testicular dysgenesis syndrome, encompasses cryptorchidism, hypospadias, decreased spermatogenesis impaired fertility [11-13] disorders sex development . additional risk factors include family history tc among first-degree relatives presence contralateral testicular tumour gcnis [15-23] although risk lower tc patients previously received platinum-based chemotherapy . genome-wide association studies revealed detectable susceptibility loci leading increased relative risk develop tc .
