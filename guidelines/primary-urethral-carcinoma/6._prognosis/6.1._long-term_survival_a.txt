6.1. Long-term survival after primary urethral carcinoma. According to the RARECARE project, the one- and 5-year relative overall survival (OS) rates in patients with urethral carcinoma in Europe are 71% and 54%, respectively [8]. Based on longer follow-up, an analysis of the SEER database, comparing prognostic factors in rare pathological types of primary urethral carcinoma (n = 257) and common pathological groups (n = 2,651), reported 10-year OS rates of 42.4% and 31.9%, respectively [57]. Cancer-specific survival (CSS) rates at five and ten years were 68% and 60%, respectively [58]. Age (> 60 years), race (others vs. whites), T-stage (T3/T4 vs. Taâ€“T2) and M-stage (M1 vs. M0) were independent prognostic risk factors for OS and CSS in rare pathological variants [57].
