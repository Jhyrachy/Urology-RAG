5.6. Treatment of erectile dysfunction. The Guidelines Panel have developed a comprehensive therapeutic and decision-making algorithm (Figure 5) for treating ED. The treatment algorithm was developed as an alternative to the traditional three-tier concept, to support personalised treatment tailored to individual patients, according to the invasiveness, tolerability and effectiveness of the different therapeutic options and patients’ expectations. In this context, patients should be fully counselled with respect to all available treatment modalities. The majority of men with ED are not treated with cause-specific therapeutic options. This results in a tailored treatment strategy that depends on invasiveness, efficacy, safety and costs, as well as patient preference [339]; therefore, physician-patient dialogue is essential throughout the management of ED. A systematic review has shown a consistent discontinuation rate for all available ED treatment options. This highlights the importance of clinicians understanding patient’s beliefs about ED treatment, therapeutic ineffectiveness, adverse effects, quality of intimate relationships and treatment costs all of which were shown to be the most prevalent barriers to treatment use [340].
