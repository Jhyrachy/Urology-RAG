5.2.5. phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors. mechanism action: phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors (pde5is) increase intracellular cyclic guanosine monophosphate, thus reducing smooth muscle tone detrusor, prostate, urethra. nitric oxide pde5is might also alter reflex pathways spinal cord neurotransmission urethra, prostate, bladder . moreover, chronic treatment pde5is seems increase blood perfusion oxygenation lut . phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors could also reduce chronic inflammation prostate bladder . exact mechanism pde5is luts remains unclear. although clinical trials several selective oral pde5is conducted men luts, tadalafil (5 mg daily) licensed treatment male luts. efficacy: randomised controlled trials demonstrated pde5is reduce ipss, storage voiding luts, improve qol. however, qmax significantly differ placebo trials . cochrane review included total sixteen rcts examined effects pde5is compared placebo standard care drugs (α1-blockers 5-aris) men luts . updated meta-analysis, pde5is led small reduction (mean difference (md) 1.89 lower; 95% ci: 2.27 lower 1.50 lower; n = 4293) ipss compared placebo . difference pde5is α1-blockers ipss . evidence limited short-term treatment twelve weeks. meta-analyses, pde5is also found improve ipss iief score, always qmax . meta-regression suggested younger men low body mass index severe luts benefit treatment pde5is . post hoc analysis data pooled four blinded trials tadalafil 5 mg vs. placebo daily, minimum improvement 25% ipss score found 60% tadalafil 44% placebo group . maximum trial duration 52 weeks . subgroup analysis pooled data four rcts demonstrated significant reduction luts, regardless baseline severity, age, previous use α-blockers pde5is, total testosterone level predicted prostate volume . post hoc analysis pooled data four rcts, tadalafil shown also effective men cardiovascular risk factors/co-morbidities, except patients receiving one antihypertensive medication. among sexually active men > 45 years, tadalafil improved luts/bph ed . integrated data analyses four placebo controlled clinical studies showed total ipss improvement largely attributed direct (92.5%) vs. indirect (7.5%) treatment effects via iief-ef improvement . another analysis showed small significant increase qmax without effect pvr . integrated analysis rcts showed tadalafil superior placebo ipss improvement twelve weeks men ≥ 75 years (with varied effect size studies) men < 75 years . open label urodynamic study 71 patients showed significant improvements voiding storage symptoms, confirmed improvements boo index (61.3 47.1), resolution fifteen (38%) 38 patients. flow rate improved 7.1 9.1 ml/s mean ipss 18.2 13.4 . multicentre, double blind, placebo controlled rct compared daily tadalafil 20 mg vs. placebo twelve weeks men luts without boo. urodynamic measures including detrusor pressure maximum urinary flow rate, qmax, maximum detrusor pressure, boo bladder capacity remained largely unchanged study statistically significant clinically adverse event differences tadalafil placebo . study shown patients oab lut obstruction unresponsive previous treatment, simultaneous administration solifenacin, tadalafil, dutasteride could effective safe choice . tolerability safety: reported adverse effects rcts comparing effect pde5is vs. placebo men luts include flushing, gastroesophageal reflux, headache, dyspepsia, back pain nasal congestion . tadalafil contraindicated patients using nitrates guanylate cyclase stimulators, riociguat, men cardiac disease sexual activity inadvisable . tadalafil also contraindicated patients myocardial infarction within last 90 days, - patients unstable angina angina occurring sexual intercourse, - patients new york heart association class 2 greater heart failure last six months, - patients uncontrolled arrhythmias, hypotension (< 90/50 mm hg), uncontrolled hypertension, - patients stroke within last six months anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy sudden loss vision known reported previous use pde5is . detailed information regarding tolerability/safety available pde5is treatment erectile dysfunction men treated α-blockers luts provided eau guidelines sexual reproductive health . practical considerations: date, tadalafil 5 mg daily officially licensed treatment male luts without ed. long-term experience tadalafil men luts limited one trial one-year follow-up ; limiting conclusions efficacy tolerability greater one year. limited information reduction prostate size data disease progression. summary evidencelephosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors significantly improve ipss iief score, qmax.1a recommendationstrength ratinguse phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors men moderate-to-severe luts without erectile dysfunction.strong
