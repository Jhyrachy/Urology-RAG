8.3. Strictures in trans women. It is acceptable to start with dilation of a short and non-obliterative stricture in trans women although no long term data about the effectiveness are available [31]. If this is not possible or if it fails, a short (< 1 cm) meatal stricture can be treated by Y-V meatoplasty with an 85% stricture-free rate [500]. Somewhat longer (1-2 cm) meatal strictures can be treated by a neovaginal advancement flap (inverted U or “7-flap”) with no recurrence observed after 37 months median follow-up [501]. Summary of evidenceLEAfter neophallic reconstruction, local tissues go through the different stages of wound healing and stable wound healing is usually achieved after six months.3After two attempts, endoscopic incision is no longer successful in trans men.3Two-stage urethroplasty for strictures at the neophallic urethra has a patency rate of 50-88% after phalloplasty and up to 100% after metoidioplasty.3Y-V meatoplasty for short (< 1 cm) meatal stenosis in trans women has a stricture-free rate of 85%.3 RecommendationsStrength ratingDo not perform endoscopic incision or urethroplasty within six months after neophalloplasty.StrongDo not perform more than two endoscopic incisions for strictures in trans men unless with palliative intent.StrongPerform staged urethroplasty for strictures at the neophallic urethra if open reconstruction is indicated.WeakPerform Y-V meatoplasty for short (< 1 cm) meatal stenosis in trans women if open reconstruction is indicated.Weak
