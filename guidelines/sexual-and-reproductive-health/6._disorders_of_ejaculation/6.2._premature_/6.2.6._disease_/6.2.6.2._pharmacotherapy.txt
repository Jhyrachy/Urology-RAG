6.2.6.2. Pharmacotherapy. 6.2.6.2.1. Dapoxetine Dapoxetine hydrochloride is a short-acting SSRI with a pharmacokinetic profile suitable for on-demand treatment for PE [636]. It has a rapid Tmax (1.3 hours) and a short half-life (95% clearance rate after 24 hours) [637,638]. It is approved for on-demand treatment of PE in European countries and elsewhere, but not in the USA. Both available doses of dapoxetine (30 mg and 60 mg) have shown 2.5- and 3.0-fold increases, respectively, in IELT overall, rising to 3.4- and 4.3-fold in patients with a baseline average IELT < 30 seconds [639]. In RCTs, dapoxetine, 30 mg or 60 mg 1-2 hours before intercourse, was effective at improving IELT and increasing ejaculatory control, decreasing distress, and increasing satisfaction [639]. Dapoxetine has shown a similar efficacy profile in men with lifelong and acquired PE [639,640]. Treatment-related adverse effects were dose-dependent and included nausea, diarrhoea, thirst, headache and dizziness [640]. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were responsible for study discontinuation in 4% (30 mg) and 10% (60 mg) of subjects [612]. There was no indication of an increased risk of suicidal ideation or suicide attempts and little indication of withdrawal symptoms with abrupt dapoxetine cessation [639,640]. Dapoxetine is safer than formal anti-depressant compounds used for treatment of PE [641]. A low rate (0.1%) of vasovagal syncope was reported in phase 3 studies [642]. According to the summary of product characteristics, vital orthostatic signs (blood pressure and heart rate) must be measured prior to starting dapoxetine, and dose titration must be considered [643]. The EMA assessment report for dapoxetine concluded that the potentially increased risk for syncope had been proven manageable with adequate risk minimisation measures [644]. No cases of syncope were observed in a post-marketing observational study, which identified patients at risk for the orthostatic reaction using the patient’s medical history and orthostatic testing [645]. Many patients and physicians may prefer using dapoxetine in combination with a PDE5I to extend the time until ejaculation and minimise the risk of ED due to dapoxetine treatment. Phase 1 studies of dapoxetine have confirmed that it has no pharmacokinetic interactions with PDE5Is (i.e., tadalafil 20 mg and sildenafil 100 mg) [646]. When dapoxetine is co-administered with PDE5Is, it is well tolerated, with a safety profile consistent with previous phase 3 studies of dapoxetine alone [647]. An RCT, including PE patients without ED, demonstrated that a combination of dapoxetine with sildenafil could significantly improve IELT values and PROs compared with dapoxetine alone or sildenafil alone, with tolerable adverse events [648]. The efficacy and safety of dapoxetine/sildenafil combination tablets for the treatment of PE have also been reported [649]. The discontinuation rates of dapoxetine seem moderate to high [650]. The cumulative discontinuation rates increase over time, reaching 90% at two years after initiation of therapy. The reasons for the high discontinuation rate are cost (29.9%), disappointment that PE was not curable and the on-demand nature of the drug (25%), adverse effects (11.6%), perceived poor efficacy (9.8%), a search for other treatment options (5.5%), and unknown (18.3%) [651]. Similarly, it was confirmed that many patients on dapoxetine treatment spontaneously discontinued treatment, while this rate was reported at 50% for other SSRIs and 28.8% for paroxetine, respectively [652]. In a Chinese cohort study, 13.6% of the patients discontinued dapoxetine due to lack of efficacy (62%), adverse effects (24%), and low frequency of sexual intercourse (14%) [653]. 6.2.6.2.2. Off-label use of antidepressants Selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors are used to treat mood disorders but can delay ejaculation and therefore have been widely used ‘off-label’ for PE since the 1990s [654-656]. Commonly used SSRIs include continuous intake of citalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine and sertraline, all of which have similar efficacy, whereas paroxetine exerts the most substantial ejaculation delay [604,657,658]. A novel 5-HT1A receptor antagonist, GSK958108, significantly delayed ejaculation in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [659]. Clomipramine, the most serotoninergic tricyclic antidepressant, was first reported in 1977 as an effective PE treatment [660,661]. In an RCT, on-demand use of clomipramine 15 mg, two to six hours before sexual intercourse was found to be associated with IELT fold change and significant improvements in PRO measures in the treatment group as compared with the placebo group (4.66 ± 5.64 vs. 2.80 ± 2.19, P < 0.05) [662,663]. The most commonly reported TEAEs were nausea in 15.7% and dizziness in 4.9% of men, respectively [662,663]. Several meta-analyses suggest SSRIs may increase the geometric mean IELT by 2.6-13.2-fold [664]. Paroxetine is superior to fluoxetine, clomipramine and sertraline [665,666]. Sertraline is superior to fluoxetine, whereas the efficacy of clomipramine is not significantly different from that of fluoxetine and sertraline. Paroxetine was evaluated in doses of 20-40 mg, sertraline 25-200 mg, fluoxetine 10-60 mg and clomipramine 25-50 mg [664-666]. Ejaculation delay may start a few days after drug intake, but it is more evident after one to two weeks as receptor desensitisation requires time to occur. Although efficacy may be maintained for several years, tachyphylaxis (decreasing response to a drug following chronic administration) may occur after six to twelve months [660]. Common TEAEs of SSRIs include fatigue, drowsiness, yawning, nausea, vomiting, dry mouth, diarrhoea and perspiration; TEAEs are usually mild and gradually improve after two to three weeks of treatment [660,667]. Decreased libido, anorgasmia, anejaculation and ED have also been reported. Because of the risk of suicidal ideation or suicide attempts, caution is suggested in prescribing SSRIs to young adolescents aged ≤ 18 years with PE, and to men with PE and a comorbid depressive disorder, particularly when associated with suicidal ideation. Patients should be advised to avoid sudden cessation or rapid dose reduction of daily-dosed SSRIs, which may be related to SSRI withdrawal syndrome [612]. Moreover, PE patients trying to conceive should avoid using these medications because of their detrimental effects on sperm cells [668-672]. 6.2.6.2.3. Topical anaesthetic agents The use of local anaesthetics to delay ejaculation is the oldest form of pharmacological therapy for PE [673]. Several trials [540,675] support the hypothesis that topical desensitising agents reduce the sensitivity of the glans penis thereby delaying ejaculatory latency, but without adversely affecting the sensation of ejaculation. Meta-analyses have confirmed the efficacy and safety of these agents for the treatment of PE [676]. In a meta-analysis, the efficacy of local anaesthetics was best among the other treatment options including SSRIs, dapoxetine 30 and 60 mg, PDE5Is and tramadol for < 8 weeks of therapy [676]. 6.2.6.2.3.1. Lidocaine/prilocaine cream Lidocaine/prilocaine creams can significantly increase the stopwatch-measured IELT from 1-2 minutes to 6-9 minutes [677,678]. Although no significant TEAEs have been reported, topical anaesthetics are contraindicated in patients or partners with an allergy to any ingredient in the product. These anaesthetic creams/gels may be transferred to the partner, resulting in vaginal numbness. Therefore, patients are advised to use a condom after applying the cream to their penis. Alternatively, the penis can be washed to clean off any residual active compound prior to sexual intercourse. Since these chemicals may be associated with cytotoxic effects on fresh human sperm cells, couples seeking parenthood should not use topical lidocaine/prilocaine-containing substances [679]. 6.2.6.2.3.2. Lidocaine/prilocaine spray The eutectic lidocaine/prilocaine spray is a metered-dose aerosol spray containing purely base forms of lidocaine (150 mg/mL) and prilocaine (50 mg/mL), which has been officially approved by the EMA for the treatment of lifelong PE [680]. Compared to topical creams, the metered-dose spray delivery system has been proved to deposit the drug in a dose-controlled, concentrated film covering the glans penis, maximising neural blockage and minimising the onset of numbness [681], without absorption through the penile shaft skin [682]. Several studies have demonstrated the efficacy of lidocaine/prilocaine spray in improving both IELT and PROs three sprays administered 5 minutes before sexual intercourse [683,684]. Published data showed that lidocaine/prilocaine spray increases IELT over time up to 6.3-fold over three months, with a month-by-month improvement through the course of the treatment in long-term studies [685]. A low incidence of local TEAEs in both patients and partners has been reported, including genital hypoaesthesia (4.5% and 1.0% in men and female partners, respectively) and ED (4.4%), and vulvovaginal burning sensation (3.9%), but is unlikely to be associated with systemic TEAEs [686,687]. Lidocaine-only sprays are also available and found to be effective in the treatment of PE [688,689]. 6.2.6.2.4. Tramadol Tramadol is a centrally-acting analgesic agent that combines opioid receptor activation and serotonin and noradrenaline re-uptake inhibition. Tramadol is a mild-opioid receptor agonist, but it also displays antagonistic properties on transporters of noradrenaline and 5-HT [690]. This mechanism of action distinguishes tramadol from other opioids, including morphine. Tramadol is readily absorbed after oral administration and has an elimination half-life of 5-7 hours. Several clinical trials evaluated the efficacy and safety of tramadol ODT (62 and 89 mg) and tramadol HCI in the treatment of PE [691]. Up to 2.5-fold increases in the median IELT have been reported among patients who received on-demand tramadol treatment [692,693]. Adverse effects were reported at doses used for analgesic purposes (≤ 400 mg daily) and included constipation, sedation and dry mouth. In May 2009, the US FDA released a warning letter about tramadol’s potential to cause addiction and difficulty in breathing [694]. The tolerability during the twelve-week study period in men with PE was acceptable [695]. Several other studies have also reported that tramadol exhibits a significant dose-related efficacy along with potential adverse effects during the treatment of PE [692,693]. The Guidelines Panel considers tramadol as a potential alternative treatment to established first-line therapeutic options in men with PE; however, it should be clearly outlined that the use of tramadol has to be considered with caution since there is a lack of data on the long-term safety of the compound in this setting. 6.2.6.2.5. Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors Although IELT was not significantly improved, sildenafil increased confidence, the perception of ejaculatory control and overall sexual satisfaction, reduced anxiety and the refractory time to achieve a second erection after ejaculation [696,697]. Several open-label studies have shown that a combination of PDE5Is and SSRIs is superior to SSRI monotherapy, which has also been recently confirmed by a Bayesian network meta-analysis [676,698]. 6.2.6.2.6. Other drugs In addition to the aforementioned drugs, there is continuous research into other treatment options. Considering the abundant α1a-adrenergic receptors in seminal vesicles and the prostate and the role of the sympathetic system in ejaculation physiology, the efficacy of selective α-blockers in the treatment of PE has been assessed [699-701]. A study demonstrated that the wake-promoting agent modafinil may be effective in delaying ejaculation and improving PROMs [702]. Decreasing penile sensitivity with glans penis augmentation using hyaluronic acid for the treatment of PE was initially proposed by Korean researchers in 2004 [703]. Since then, it has gained popularity mainly in Asian countries [704,705]. Randomised controlled studies demonstrated that hyaluronic acid glans injections were safe, with a modest but significant increase in IELT along with improvements in PRO measures [704,705]. No serious TEAEs were reported related to glans penis injections with hyaluronic acid. However, this procedure may result in serious complications, and more safety studies must be conducted before recommending this treatment to PE patients [706]. Selective dorsal neurectomy has also been suggested for the treatment of PE, mainly by Asian researchers [707-713]. However, considering the irreversible nature of these procedures, more safety data are warranted. Considering the importance of central oxytocin receptors in the ejaculation reflex, several researchers have assessed the efficacy and safety of oxytocin receptor antagonists in the treatment of PE [714]. Epelsiban [715] and cligosiban [716-719] have been found to be safe and mildly effective in delaying ejaculation, but further controlled trials are needed [718,719]. Delayed ejaculation was associated with the use of pregabalin, a new generation of gabapentinoids, as a side-effect. On-demand oral pregabalin 150 mg was found to increase the IELTs of patients 2.45 ± 1.43-fold. Treatment-emergent side effects (blurred vision, dizziness, vomiting) were minimal and did not lead to drug discontinuation [720]. The role of other proposed treatment modalities for the treatment of PE, such as penis-root masturbation [721], vibrator-assisted start-stop exercises [633], transcutaneous functional electric stimulation [722,723], transcutaneous posterior tibial nerve stimulation [724], acupuncture [725-727] and practising yoga [728] need more evidence to be considered in the clinical setting.
