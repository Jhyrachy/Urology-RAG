3.6. acute scrotum. 3.6.1. epidemiology, aetiology pathophysiology acute scrotum paediatric urological emergency, commonly caused torsion testis appendix testis, epididymitis/epididymo-orchitis [232-237]. causes acute scrotal pain idiopathic scrotal oedema, mumps orchitis, varicocele, scrotal haematoma, incarcerated hernia, appendicitis systemic disease (e.g. henoch-schönlein purpura) [238-250]. trauma also cause acute scrotum due post-traumatic haematomas, testicular contusion, rupture, dislocation torsion [251-256]. scrotal fat necrosis also reported uncommon cause mild-to-moderate scrotal pain pre-pubertal overweight boys exposure cold . chapter testicular torsion epididymitis discussed, recurrent epididymitis discussed chapter dealing infections. torsion testis occurs often neonatal period around puberty, whereas torsion appendix testis occurs wider age range . epididymitis affects two age groups: less one year twelve fifteen years . one study predicted annual incidence epididymitis around 1.2 per 1,000 children . perinatal torsion testis often occurs prenatally. bilateral torsion comprises 11-21% perinatal cases . cases perinatal torsion extravaginal, contrast usual intravaginal torsion occurs puberty. 3.6.2. diagnostic evaluation patients usually present scrotal pain, except neonatal torsion. sudden onset invalidating pain combination vomiting typical torsion testis appendix testis . general, duration symptoms presentation shorter testicular torsion (69% present within twelve hours) torsion appendix testis (62%) compared epididymitis (31%) .prepubertal males likely present atypical symptoms delayed presentation diagnosis, leading delayed surgical intervention higher rate orchiectomy, compared postpubertal boys . early phase, location pain lead diagnosis. patients acute epididymitis experience tender epididymis, whereas patients testicular torsion likely tender testicle, case torsion appendix testis may isolated tenderness superior pole testis . abnormal (horizontal) position testis frequent testicular torsion epididymitis . looking absence cremasteric reflex simple method 100% sensitivity 66% specificity testicular torsion (le: 3). elevation scrotum may reduce complaints epididymitis, testicular torsion. fever occurs often epididymitis (11-19%). classical sign “blue dot” found 10-23% patients torsion appendix testis . many cases, easy determine cause acute scrotum based history physical examination alone [232-237,259,266]. positive urine culture found patients epididymitis . remembered normal urinalysis exclude epididymitis. similarly, abnormal urinalysis exclude testicular torsion. doppler us useful evaluate acute scrotum, 63.6-100% sensitivity 97-100% specificity, positive predictive value 100% negative predictive value 97.5% [268-273] (le: 3). use doppler us may reduce number patients acute scrotum undergoing scrotal exploration, operator-dependent difficult perform pre-pubertal patients . may also show misleading arterial flow early phases torsion partial intermittent torsion. key importance, persistent arterial flow exclude testicular torsion. multicentre study 208 boys torsion testis, 24% normal increased testicular vascularisation . comparison side always done. better results reported using high-resolution us (hrus) direct visualisation spermatic cord twist sensitivity 97.3% specificity 99% (le: 2). so-called positive whirlpool sign (the presence spiral-like pattern), pooled sensitivity specificity 0.73 (95% ci; 0.65-0.79) 0.99 (95% ci; 0.92-0.99), respectively, may viewed definitive sign testicular torsion. role neonates limited . scintigraphy and, recently, dynamic contrast-enhanced subtraction mri scrotum also provide comparable sensitivity specificity us [277-280]. investigations may used diagnosis less likely torsion testis still cannot excluded history physical examination. done without inordinate delays emergency intervention . diagnosis acute epididymitis boys mainly based clinical judgement adjunctive investigation. however, remembered findings secondary inflammatory changes absence evidence extra-testicular nodule doppler us might suggest erroneous diagnosis epididymitis children torsion appendix testes . pre-pubertal boys acute epididymitis incidence underlying urogenital anomalies 25-27.6%. complete urological evaluation children acute epididymitis still debatable . 3.6.3. management 3.6.3.1. epididymitis pre-pubertal boys, aetiology usually unclear, underlying pathology 25%. urine culture usually negative, unlike older boys, sexually transmitted disease rare. antibiotic treatment, although often started, indicated cases unless urinalysis urine culture show bacterial infection . epididymitis usually self-limiting supportive therapy (i.e. minimal physical activity analgesics) heals without sequelae (le: 3). however, bacterial epididymitis complicated abscess necrotic testis surgical exploration required . 3.6.3.2. testicular torsion manual detorsion testis done without anaesthesia, attempted patients possible, associated improved surgical salvage rates . initially done outward rotation testis - like opening book -, unless pain increases obvious resistance. success defined immediate relief symptoms normal findings physical examination (le: 3). doppler us may used guidance . bilateral orchiopexy still required successful detorsion. done elective procedure, rather immediately following detorsion. one study reported residual torsion exploration 17 53 patients, including eleven patients reported pain relief manual detorsion . external cooling exploration may effective reducing ischaemia reperfusion injury preserving viability torsed contralateral testis . medical treatments aimed limiting injury remain experimental [289-292]. torsion appendix testis managed non-operatively use anti-inflammatory analgesics (le: 4). six-week follow-up, clinically us, testicular atrophy revealed. surgical exploration done equivocal cases patients persistent pain . although metachronous torsion appendix testis may occur 8.5%, necessary explore contralateral side, given benign nature ot problem. besides demonstrated nnt 24 . 3.6.3.3. surgical treatment testicular torsion urgent condition requires prompt surgical treatment. two important determinants early salvage rate testis time onset symptoms detorsion, degree cord twisting . severe testicular atrophy occurred torsion little four hours turn > 360°. cases incomplete torsion (180-360°), symptom duration twelve hours, atrophy observed. however, necrotic severely atrophied testis found cases torsion > 360° symptom duration > 24 hours . early surgical intervention detorsion (mean torsion time less thirteen hours) found preserve fertility . urgent surgical exploration mandatory cases testicular torsion within 24 hours symptom onset. patients testicular torsion > 24 hours, exploration may performed semi-elective exploration procedure (le: 3), unless clear history torsion-detorsion urgent exploration still considered. case prolonged torsion (> 24 hours) still subject debate whether surgically detorsed testis preserved. alternative detorsion fixation may perform orchiectomy. study found sperm quality preserved orchiectomy orchidopexy comparison normal control men, although orchiectomy resulted better sperm morphology incision tunica albuginea tunica vaginalis graft prevent treat compartment syndrome also suggested . neonates signs testicular torsion birth duration symptoms clear. decision perform surgical exploration weighed general condition child. age group operation safely done spinal anesthesia. new onset symptoms testicular torsion neonates considered surgical emergency similar older boys. exploration, fixation contralateral testis also performed. good clinical practice also perform fixation contralateral testis prenatal neonatal torsion, although literature support this, remove atrophied testicle . recurrence orchidopexy rare (4.5%) may occur several years later. consensus recommendation preferred type fixation suture material . 3.6.4. follow-up patients require follow-up mainly fertility issues hormonal consequences. despite timely adequate detorsion fixation testicle, half patients may develop testicular atrophy, even intraoperatively assessed viable, counselled accordingly . 3.6.4.1. fertility results vary conflicting. one study, unilateral torsion testis seriously intervened subsequent spermatogenesis 50% patients produced borderline impairment another 20% . although, 30% affected testicles mumps orchitis show degree atrophy, long-term outcome terms fertility conclusive . study showed normal pregnancy rate unilateral testicular torsion, difference patients undergoing orchidopexy orchidectomy . 3.6.4.2. subfertility subfertility found 36-39% patients torsion. semen analysis may normal 5-50% long-term follow-up . early surgical intervention (mean torsion time less thirteen hours) detorsion found preserve fertility, prolonged torsion period (mean 70 hours) followed orchiectomy jeopardised fertility . subfertility infertility consequences direct injury testis torsion. caused cut-off blood supply, also post-ischaemia-reperfusion injury caused detorsion oxygen-derived free radicals rapidly circulated within testicular parenchyma . 3.6.4.3. androgen levels even though levels fsh, luteinising hormone (lh) testosterone higher patients testicular torsion compared normal controls, endocrine testicular function remains normal range testicular torsion . 3.6.4.4. unanswered questions although testicular torsion common problem, mechanism neonatal prenatal torsion still exactly known, well whether fixation contralateral testicle cases really necessary. influence atrophied testicle fertility also unclear. summary evidencelediagnosis testicular torsion based presentation
