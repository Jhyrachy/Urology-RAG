6.4.1. Conservative treatment and Indications for active stone removal. Migratory bladder stones in adults may typically be left untreated, especially asymptomatic small stones. Rates of spontaneous stone passage are unknown, but data on ureteric stones suggest stones < 1 cm are likely to pass in the absence of BOO, bladder dysfunction, or long-term catheterisation (see section 3.4.9 Specific stone management of ureteral stones). Primary and secondary bladder stones are usually symptomatic and are unlikely to pass spontaneously: active treatment of such stones is therefore indicated.
