4.2. According to stricture tightness. Several classifications systems have been proposed over the years [142]. The definition of low- vs. high-grade strictures remains debatable [143-145]. A urethral plate less than 3 mm is considered a high-grade or tight stricture [146]. It has been demonstrated with a normally functioning bladder that flow rate will not diminish until the urethral lumen has a diameter below 10 Fr [144]. Table 4.1 presents a suggested classification for male patients with a normal functioning bladder. This classification was developed by the EAU Urethral Stricture Panel based on a consensus process.
