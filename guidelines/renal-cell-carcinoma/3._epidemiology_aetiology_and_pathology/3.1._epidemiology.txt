3.1. Epidemiology. Renal cell carcinoma represents around 3% of all cancers, with the highest incidence occurring in Western countries [3,4]. In 2020, there were an estimated 431,288 new cases of RCC globally, of which 138,611 in Europe [5]. The higher incidence in Europe and North America is hypothesized to be due to a higher prevalence of small renal masses (SRMs) in settings where abdominal imaging is more ubiquitous. In 2020, Lithuania reported the highest overall rate of RCC, followed by Czechia, with estimated age-standardised rates (ASRs) of 14.5/100,000 and 14.42/100,000, respectively. A person living in Czechia has a 2.83% risk of developing RCC [4,5]. Generally, during the last two decades until recently, there has been an annual increase of about 2% in incidence both worldwide and in Europe. In 2022, worldwide mortality from RCC was 179,368 deaths (115,600 men and 63,768 women), with a calculated global ASR rate of 1.8/100,000 [5]. There has been a decrease in mortality since the 1980s in Scandinavian countries and since the early 1990s in France, Germany, Austria, the Netherlands, and Italy. However, in some European countries (Croatia, Estonia, Greece, Ireland, Slovakia), mortality rates still show an upward trend [3,4]. Renal cell carcinoma is the most common solid lesion within the kidney and accounts for approximately 90% of all kidney malignancies. It comprises different RCC subtypes with specific histopathological and genetic characteristics. There is a 1.5â€“2.0:1 predominance in men over women with a higher incidence in the older population [4-6].
