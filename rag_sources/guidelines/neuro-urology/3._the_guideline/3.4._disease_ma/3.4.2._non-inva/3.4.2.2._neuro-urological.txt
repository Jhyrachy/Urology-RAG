3.4.2.2. neuro-urological rehabilitation. 3.4.2.2.1. bladder rehabilitation including electrical stimulation term bladder rehabilitation summarises treatment options aim re-establish bladder function patients neuro-urological symptoms. strong contraction urethral sphincter and/or pelvic floor, well anal dilatation, manipulation genital region, physical activity inhibit micturition reflex manner . first mechanism affected activation efferent nerve fibres, latter ones produced activation afferent fibres . electrical stimulation pudendal nerve afferents, strongly inhibits micturition reflex detrusor contraction . stimulation might support restoration balance excitatory inhibitory inputs spinal supraspinal level . evidence bladder rehabilitation using electrical stimulation neurological patients mainly based small non-comparative studies high risk bias. behavioural therapy bladder training: patients pd, behavioural therapy bladder training may considered based randomised controlled trials (rcts) limited number patients . pelvic floor muscle training (pfmt): patients ms stroke, pfmt may positive effects luts, daytime urinary frequency urinary incontinence evidence still limited . peripheral temporary electrostimulation: tibial nerve stimulation transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (tens) might effective safe treating neurogenic lut dysfunction, reliable evidence well-designed rcts required reach definitive conclusions . post-stroke patients tens shown effectively improve urodynamic bladder diary findings well qol [159-161]. rct, transcutaneous tibial nerve home stimulation proven significantly improve bladder diary parameters patients ms well women pd . acute sci, tens able achieve bladder neuromodulation via modulation autonomous nervous system functions . greater volumes full sensation, less detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia increased bladder capacity found compared sham-treated patients . sr dorsal genital nerve stimulation showed higher relative absolute bladder capacities inhibition detrusor hyperactivity sci people, although therapeutic effects may dependent current, amplitude longer periods stimulation . interferential medium frequency current electrical stimulation sci patients american spinal cord injury association impairment scale (ais) levels b, c demonstrated significant decrease pvr volume urine leakage catheterisation . neuromuscular electrical stimulation applied sacral area also improved performance symptoms scores highly selected patients ui stroke ; however, new rcts patients longer follow-up required. peripheral temporary electrostimulation combined pelvic floor muscle training biofeedback: ms patients, combining active neuromuscular electrical stimulation pelvic floor muscle training (pfmt) emg biofeedback achieve substantial reduction neuro-urological symptoms . treatment combination seems effective either therapy alone . however, combination intravaginal electrostimulation pfmt superior pfmt alone reducing ui women incomplete sci . intravesical electrostimulation: intravesical electrostimulation increase bladder capacity improve bladder filling sensation patients incomplete sci myelomeningocele (mmc) . patients neurogenic detrusor underactivity, intravesical electrostimulation may also improve voiding reduce residual volume . repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation: although improvement neuro-urological symptoms described pd, sci ms patients, technique still investigation . role cortical well sacral magnetic stimulation ms patients underactive bladder needs better defined . summary: date, bladder rehabilitation techniques mainly based electrical magnetic stimulation; however, lack well-designed studies.
