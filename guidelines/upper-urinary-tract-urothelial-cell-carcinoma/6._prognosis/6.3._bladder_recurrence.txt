6.3. Bladder recurrence. A meta-analysis of available data has identified significant predictors of bladder recurrence after RNU [22]. Three categories of predictors for increased risk of bladder recurrence were identified: Patient-specific factors such as male gender, previous BC, smoking and pre-operative chronic kidney disease.Tumour-specific factors such as positive pre-operative urinary cytology, tumour grade, ureteral location, multifocality, tumour diameter, invasive pT stage, and necrosis [204,205].Treatment-specific factors such as laparoscopic approach, extravesical bladder cuff removal, and positive surgical margins [22]. In addition, the use of diagnostic URS has been associated with a higher risk of developing bladder recurrence after RNU [206,207]. Based on low-level evidence only, a single dose of intravesical chemotherapy after diagnostic/therapeutic ureteroscopy of non-metastatic UTUC has been suggested to lower the rate of intravesical recurrence, similarly to that after RNU [22].
