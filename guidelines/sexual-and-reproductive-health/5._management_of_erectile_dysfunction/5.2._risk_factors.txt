5.2. Risk factors. Erectile dysfunction is associated with numerous risk factors including age, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidaemia, hypertension, CVD, obesity, MetS, hyperhomocysteinemia, lack of exercise, smoking and drug use [242,244-255]. In addition, several therapeutic agents for CVD have been shown to have a detrimental effect on erectile function (EF), whereas newer drugs have exhibited a neutral or even beneficial effect [247,256,257]. Other reported risk factors include atrial fibrillation, hyperthyroidism, vitamin D and folic acid deficiency, hyperuricemia, depression and anxiety disorders, chronic kidney and rheumatic disease, COPD, migraine, inflammatory bowel disease and osteoporosis [252,258-270]. In addition, a growing body of evidence has demonstrated an association between the onset of new ED in men who have had COVID-19 [1974-1976]. Erectile dysfunction is also frequently associated with other urological conditions and procedures including LUTS/BPH and surgery for LUTS/BPH [275-277], chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CPPS) and chronic prostatitis [278], bladder pain syndrome/interstitial cystitis [279], premature ejaculation [280] and urethroplasty surgery for posterior urethral strictures [281].
