5.6.5.2. Male Slings. Male slings have been introduced to treat mild-to-moderate PPI. However, the definitions of mild and moderate UI are unclear. The majority of studies define cure as ‘no pad use’ or ‘one security pad per 24-hours’. Some authors used more strict criteria such as ‘urine loss of less than 2 g per 24-hour pad test’ [672]. 5.6.5.2.1. Non-adjustable slings Mechanism of Action: Non-adjustable male slings are positioned under the urethra and fixed by a retropubic or transobturator approach. The tension is adjusted during the surgery, and it cannot be re-adjusted post-operatively. Synthetic slings restore continence in males either by urethral compression and/or by repositioning the bulb of urethra [673,674]. Efficacy: A SR and meta-analysis involving 33 prospective cohorts and one RCT comparing sling to AUS, reported that both options are effective in improving UI and QoL [675]. Following sling insertion, the overall cure rate was 60% (95% CI: 0.51-0.67) and 56% (95% CI: 0.44-0.68) for sling and AUS respectively. The 24-hour pad use was -3.33 (95% CI: -4.33 to -2.34) and -3.75 (95% CI: -4.56 to -2.93) for slings and AUS, respectively. Similar findings were reported by a network meta-analysis that showed comparable efficacy between slings and AUS [676]. The MASTER Trial, a non-inferiority RCT comparing the outcomes of continence surgery in men with bothersome urodynamic SUI, using a very strict definition of UI after prostate surgery, reported that at twelve-months continence rates were 87% for male sling vs. 84.2% for AUS (95% CI: -11.6-4.6, PNI=0.003]), confirming non-inferiority [677]. The subgroup analysis suggested that male sling is inferior to AUS for men with greater incontinence at baseline (pad weight > 250g); however, the difference did not reach statistical significance. For the re-positioning sling (AdVance™ and AdVanceXP©), a mean subjective cure rate of 49% (8.6 - 73.7%) after mean follow-up of three years has been reported for 136 patients [678]. A prospective multicentre cohort study, with 60-month follow-up, in men with AdVanceXP demonstrated a constant continence outcome over time with a 57.6% cure rate, 25.4% improvement rate and 16.9% failure rate. These findings were verified in an additional study which reported cure rates of 66.7% and 71.7%, improvement rates of 26.5% and 24.4% and failures rates of 6.9% and 13.3% at 24- and 48-months, respectively [679]. A retrospective comparative study showed that both options are safe and effective in the treatment of male SUI [680]. With the transobturator compressive I-Stop TOMS male sling, 38% of men were dry at twelve months, but this reduced to 23% and 15% after four and five years, respectively [681]. Tolerability and safety: A SR and meta-analysis of 1,170 men with SUI and male sling, reported that the predictors of failure are prior radiation, severity of incontinence and previous surgeries [682]. Pelvic radiotherapy has also been reported in other studies as a negative prognostic factor [683]. A comparison among radiated vs. non-radiated men who had AdVanceXP reported a greater degree of post-operative improvement in the non-radiated group (49.6% vs. 22.2%) as well as greater satisfaction rates (95% vs. 64%) [684]. The most common complication with male slings is pain and local superficial wound infection [685]. Chronic pain has been observed in 1.3% of men who had non-adjustable slings [685]. Post-operative transient voiding dysfunction occurred in 4.3-10.3%, mostly as de novo urgency or urinary retention, while erosions and chronic pain were uncommon (0-0.4%), as was explantation [103,678,679,686,687]. Practical considerations: Fixed male slings are considered safe and improve continence, but their efficacy is limited in men with severe incontinence or previous radiotherapy. 5.6.5.2.2. Adjustable slings in males Mechanism of Action: Adjustable slings in males are those for which the tension of the sling can be adjusted post-operatively. Three main systems have been used in men: the Remeex® system [688], the Argus® system [689] and the ATOMS® system [690]. Efficacy: There is one small RCT for adjustable slings in males [691]. Most studies consist of prospective or retrospective case series, with variable follow-up and different definitions of success [688,690-694]. A SR reported objective cure rates varying between 17-92% after adjustable sling implantation [685]. For the Remeex® system, only two studies, with conflicting findings, have been published. One study followed nineteen patients for nearly seven years and reported 70% success, with no explants, infections, or erosions [688]. The second study followed fourteen patients for 25 months. Only 36% of patients were satisfied and multiple re-adjustments were needed. Mechanical failure was reported in 21% [692]. Data on the Argus® system has been reported for 404 men, but only few series have reported on more than 40 patients, with the longest follow-up being 35-months. Success rates varied between 17-93%, with a mean of 73.0% reporting subjective cure [693,694]. A head-to-head comparison between the two Argus systems reported similar efficacy outcomes at 44 months, but Argus T was associated with a higher inguinal pain and explantation rate [695]. A small study of 22 men with PPI randomised to AdVance or Argus T reported superior 24-hour pad test results and of patient satisfaction levels for Argus T at eighteen-months follow-up [691]. A SR of the ATOMS system reported the pooled evidence from 1,393 patients with a 67% dryness, 90% improvement after adjustment and 16.4% complication rate [690]. The expulsion rate was 5.75%. Another SR and meta-analysis with 3,059 patients reported that ATOMS was superior to ProACT in mean dryness rate (68% vs. 55%), overall improvement (91% vs. 80%), satisfaction rate (87% vs. 56%), mean number of filing adjustments (2.4 vs. 3.5) and post-operative pad use per day (1.1 vs. 2.1) [696]. Tolerability and Safety: The most frequent complications in adjustable male slings are pain, erosions, and infections [685]. Pain at the implant site was usually only temporary, but chronic pain has been reported in 1.5% of men [693,694]. The number of implants requiring re-adjustment is reported between 8-38.6% [694,697,698]. Explantation rates range from 10-15.8% and erosion rate is estimated around 10% [682]. The most common reasons for explantation are device infection (4.1-8%), erosions (4-12%), and urethral perforations (2.7-16%). A SR reported a device explantation rate of 5% vs. 25% and a major complication rate of 4.2% vs. 10.4% for ATOMS and ProACT, respectively [696]. Practical considerations: There is no evidence that adjustability offers additional benefit as RCTs are lacking; therefore, no recommendation can be made at this time. Explantation rate seems superior to fixed male sling based on external comparisons. 5.6.5.2.3. Autologous slings The strategy of intra-operative placement of an autologous vas deferens sling below the vesico-urethral anastomosis during robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) has been explored with the intention to improve early return of continence. Two RCTs [699,700] showed an advantage of sling vs. no sling at one-month follow-up, and another study [701] showed an advantage of a 6-branch vs. a 2-branch sling at one month follow-up. However, a larger RCT (n=195), showed that continence rate and near-continence rate were similar between groups at six months with 66% vs. 65% and 86% vs. 88%, respectively [702]. Summary of evidenceLEThere is limited short-, medium- and long-term evidence that fixed transobturator male slings cure or improve PPI in patients with mild-to-moderate incontinence.1bMen with severe incontinence, previous radiotherapy or transurethral surgery may have less benefit from fixed transobturator male slings.2There is limited evidence that adjustable male slings can cure or improve SUI in men.3There is no evidence that adjustability offers additional benefit over other types of slings.3Explantation rate with adjustable male slings seems superior to fixed male sling based on external comparisons.4There is no evidence that intra-operative placement of an autologous sling during RARP improves return of continence at six months.1b RecommendationsStrength ratingOffer non-adjustable transobturator slings to men with mild-to-moderate* post-prostatectomy incontinence.WeakInform men that severe incontinence, prior pelvic radiotherapy or transurethral surgery may worsen the outcome of non-adjustable male sling surgery.Weak * The terms “mild” and “moderate” PPI remain undefined.
