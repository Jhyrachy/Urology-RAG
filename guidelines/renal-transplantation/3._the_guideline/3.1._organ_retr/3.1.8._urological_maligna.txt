3.1.8. Urological malignancy and renal transplantation. The following section is limited to a synopsis of three systematic reviews conducted by the EAU Renal Transplantation Panel. 3.1.8.1. Malignancy prior to renal transplantation 3.1.8.1.1. In the recipient Standard procedure for transplant candidates includes systematic screening for the presence of any active/latent cancer or a past history of cancer. In candidates with a previous history of urological cancer, it can be challenging to decide if patients are suitable for transplantation and if so how long the waiting period prior to transplantation should be. To date, the waiting period has been primarily based on the Cincinnati Registry, which takes into account the type of tumour and the time between its treatment and kidney transplantation. However, the Cincinnati Registry has potential drawbacks as it does not consider the epidemiology of tumours or that diagnostic and therapeutic procedures/tests have changed over time and that prognostic tools have improved. Additionally, treatment and the staging of the disease are not defined. According to a recent systematic review the risk of tumour recurrence was similar between transplantation (n=786) and dialysis (n=1,733) populations for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and prostate cancer (PCa). This was especially true for low grade/stage PCa, for which the risk of recurrence was low and consistent with nomograms [227]. For low stage/grade RCC the recurrence rate was significant for both dialysis and renal transplantation; however, recurrences were actually contralateral RCC with no impact on patient or graft survival [227]. Testicular cancer had a low risk of recurrence but case reports highlighted the possibility of late recurrence even for stage I tumours [227]. For urothelial carcinoma, studies were mainly related to upper urinary tract carcinomas in the context of aristolochic acid nephropathy for which the rate of synchronous bilateral tumour was 10-16% and the rate of contralateral recurrence was 31-39% [227]. These findings imply that a kidney transplant candidate with a history of appropriately treated low stage/grade PCa (PSA ≤ 10, Gleason score ≤ 6 and T1/T2a) or low grade T1 RCC could be listed for renal transplantation without any additional delay compared to a cancer-free patient. However, as the level of evidence was low, more studies are needed to standardise waiting periods before renal transplantation. Summary of evidenceLERenal Cell CarcinomaThe recurrence rates for transplanted vs. dialysed patients at <1, 1–5, and > 5 years were 0–8% vs. 0%, 0–27% vs. 0–9% and 0–41% vs. 0–48%, respectively.2bOverall five year survival rates for transplantation vs dialysed patients were 80–100% vs. 76–100%, respectively.Prostate CancerThe recurrence rates for transplantation patients at <1 and > 5 years were 0–9% and 4–20%, respectively.2bOverall, 1–5 year survival rates for transplantation patients ranged from 62% to 100%. RecommendationStrength ratingList for renal transplantation patients with a history of appropriately treated low stage/grade renal cell carcinoma or prostate cancer without additional delay.Weak 3.1.8.1.2. In the potential donor kidney In the general population, RCC constitutes 3% of all malignancies, with the incidence being highest in patients aged > 60 years. The current increasing age of donors may lead to a higher number of incidental RCCs found in donor kidneys and could theoretically decrease the number of kidneys suitable for transplantation. The main surgical approach to these kidneys is ex vivo tumour excision on the back-table with an oncological margin, frozen section biopsy, bench surgery renorraphy, and finally transplantation in the conventional fashion [228]. A systematic review assessed the effectiveness and harms of using kidneys with small renal tumours, from deceased or living donors, as a source for renal transplantation and it reported that five year overall and graft survival rates were 92% and 95.6%, respectively [228]. Tumour excision was performed ex-vivo in all cases except for two (107/109 patients), and the vast majority of excised tumours were RCCs (88/109 patients), with clear-cell subtype the most common [228]. This systematic review, although with low-level evidence, suggested that kidneys with small renal masses are an acceptable source for renal transplantation and do not compromise oncological outcomes with similar functional outcomes to other donor kidneys. Summary of evidenceLETumour excision was performed ex-vivo in all cases except for two (107/109 patients).2bOverall survival rates at one, three and five years were 97.7%, 95.4%, and 92%, respectively.Mean graft survival rates at one, three and five years were 99.2%, 95%, and 95.6%, respectively. RecommendationStrength ratingDo not discard a kidney for potential transplantation on the basis of a small renal mass alone.Weak 3.1.8.2. Malignancy after renal transplantation Cancer development after kidney transplant has become a major problem as it is one of the main causes of death in this population. Urological cancers, have an increased incidence after kidney transplantation partly due to the increasing age of recipients and their prolonged survival after transplantation. Treatment of localised PCa following kidney transplantation is challenging due the presence of the kidney graft in the pelvic cavity close to the prostate. Two systematic reviews reported that oncological outcomes following PCa treatment in kidney transplant recipients are comparable to the non-transplanted population [229,230] and surgery (radical prostatectomy), carried out in tertiary high-volume referral centres was the treatment choice in 75 to 85% of patients [229,230]. Marra et al., reported cancer-specific survival rates of 96.8% for surgery, 88.2% for radiotherapy with androgen deprivation therapy and 100% for brachytherapy at mean follow-up of 24 months [230]. Hevia et al., reported five year cancer-specific survival of 97.5% for surgery, 87.5% for external beam radiation and 94.4% for brachytherapy [229]. Summary of evidenceLESurgery (radical prostatectomy) was the most frequently performed treatment for localised PCa after kidney transplant.2bOverall oncological outcomes following PCa treatment in kidney transplant recipients were comparable to the non-transplanted population.2b RecommendationsStrength ratingBe aware of the presence of a kidney transplant in the pelvis and the possibility of subsequent transplants when planning treatment for prostate cancer.StrongRefer kidney transplant patients with prostate cancer to an integrated transplant urology centre.Strong
