7.1.3.1. radical nephrectomy techniques. 7.1.3.1.1. open versus laparoscopic robotic approach rcts assessed oncological outcomes laparoscopic vs. open rn. retrospective comparative study data retrieved national database studying os open vs. minimally-invasive rn (laparoscopic rn rarn) showed os benefit minimally invasive rn group, well hospital stay, re-admission rate, 30-day 90-day mortality rate . however, sr demonstrate survival difference lrn orn . data one sr two nrs showed significantly shorter hospital stay lower analgesic requirement laparoscopic rn group compared open group. convalescence time also significantly shorter . surgical complication rates low wide confidence intervals. difference complications, operation time significantly shorter open nephrectomy arm. quality life perioperative outcomes inconsistently defined, measured, reported (le: 2b, based 1 low quality sr). 7.1.3.1.2. laparoscopic versus robotic approach data large retrospective cohort study robot-assisted laparoscopic vs. laparoscopic rn showed robot-assisted laparoscopic rn associated increased risk major complications longer operating time higher hospital costs compared laparoscopic rn . sr meta-analysis seven studies including 1,832 patients showed difference two approaches peri-operative outcomes, including operative time, blood loss, conversion rates complications . sr reported robot-assisted laparoscopic vs. conventional laparoscopic rn, showing substantial differences local recurrence rates, all-cause csm . 7.1.3.1.3. laparoscopic single port versus laparoscopic multiport approach similar results seen observational cohort studies comparing ‘portless’ 3-port laparoscopic rn, similar peri-operative outcomes .
