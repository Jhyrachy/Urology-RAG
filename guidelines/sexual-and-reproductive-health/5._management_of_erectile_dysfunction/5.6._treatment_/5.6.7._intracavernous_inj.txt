5.6.7. Intracavernous injections therapy. Intracavernous administration of vasoactive drugs was the first medical treatment introduced for ED [395,418]. Patients may be offered intracavernous injections at every stage of a tailored treatment work-up. 5.6.7.1. Alprostadil Alprostadil (CaverjectTM, Edex/ViridalTM) was the first and only drug approved for intracavernous treatment of ED [395,419]. Intracavernous alprostadil is most efficacious as a monotherapy at a dose of 5-40 μg (40 μg may be offered off-label in some European countries). The erection appears after 5-15 minutes and lasts according to the dose injected, but with significant heterogeneity among patients. An office-training programme is required for patients to learn the injection technique. Efficacy rates for intracavernous alprostadil of > 70% have been found in the general ED population, as well as in patient subgroups (e.g., men with diabetes or CVD), with reported satisfaction rates of 87-93.5% in patients and 86-90.3% in partners after the injections [395,418]. Complications of intracavernous alprostadil include penile pain (50% of patients reported pain only after 11% of total injections), excessively prolonged and undesired erections (5%), priapism (1%), and fibrosis (2%) [395,418,420]. Pain is usually self-limited after prolonged use and it can be alleviated with the addition of sodium bicarbonate or local anaesthesia [395,418,421]. Cavernosal fibrosis usually clears within a few months after temporary discontinuation of the injection programme. However, tunical fibrosis suggests early onset of Peyronie’s disease and may indicate the need to discontinue intracavernous injections indefinitely. Systemic adverse effects are uncommon. The most common is mild hypotension, especially when using higher doses. Contraindications include men with a history of hypersensitivity to alprostadil, men at risk of priapism, and men with bleeding disorders. Despite these favourable data, drop-out rates of 41-68% have been reported for intracavernous pharmacotherapy [395,418,422,423], with most discontinuations occurring within the first two to three months. Careful counselling of patients during the office-training phase as well as close follow-up are important in addressing patient withdrawal from an intracavernous injection programme [424-426]. 5.6.7.2. Other vasoactive intracavernous treatments Table 12 details the available intracavernous injection therapies (compounds and characteristics). Combination therapy enables a patient to take advantage of the different modes of action of the drugs being used, as well as alleviating adverse effects by using lower doses of each drug. Papaverine (20-80 mg) was the first oral drug used for intracavernous injections. It is most commonly used in combination therapy because of its high incidence of adverse effects as monotherapy. Papaverine is currently not licensed for the treatment of ED.Phentolamine has been used in combination therapy to increase efficacy. As monotherapy, it produces a poor erectile response. Phentolamine is currently not licensed for the treatment of ED.Limited data support the use of other drugs, such as vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), NO donors (linsidomine), forskolin, potassium channel openers, moxisylyte or calcitonin gene-related peptide, usually combined with the main drugs [427,428]. Most combinations are not standardised and some drugs have limited availability worldwide.Bimix, (papaverine 7.5-45 mg plus phentolamine 0.25-1.5 mg) and Trimix (papaverine 8-16 mg plus phentolamine 0.2-0.4 mg plus alprostadil 10-20 μg), have been widely used with improved efficacy rates, although they have never been licensed for ED [429,430]. Trimix has the highest efficacy rates, reaching 92%; this combination has similar adverse effects as alprostadil monotherapy, but a lower incidence of penile pain due to lower doses of alprostadil. However, fibrosis is more common (5-10%) when papaverine is used (depending on the total dose).InvicorpTM: Vasoactive intestinal peptide (25 μg) plus phentolamine mesylate (1-2 mg Invicorp), is a combination of two active components with complementary modes of action. Clinical studies have shown that the combination is effective for intracavernous injections in > 80% of men with ED, including those who have failed to respond to other therapies and, unlike existing intracavernous therapies, is associated with a low incidence of penile pain and a virtually negligible risk of priapism [431]. Overall, despite high efficacy rates, 5-10% of patients do not respond to combination therapy with intracavernous injections.
