6.3.1.1. Staged augmentation urethroplasty. Classically called “two-stage” urethroplasty, this approach may become a multi-stage urethroplasty as revision (usually due to graft contracture) after the first stage has been reported in 0-20% of cases [256-259]. Therefore, the term “staged” should be used instead [260]. Revision rates before second stage were 0-20%, stressing that a two-stage urethroplasty might become a multi-stage urethroplasty. In general, reconstructive urologists tend to follow this approach in men with more complex urethral stricture disease (multiple interventions in the past, unfavourable clinical findings such as significant spongiofibrosis or scarring that requires excision, poor quality of the urethral plate). An interval of at least four to six months has been proposed before proceeding to the tubularisation of the urethra, provided that the graft has healed uneventfully [261-263]. A SR by Mangera et al., has shown an average patency rate of 90.5% with the use of all types of grafts for staged penile urethroplasties with an average follow-up of 22.2 months [264]. Patency rates of staged oral mucosa graft (OMG) urethroplasty in specific locations vary between 73.3 and 100% [255,256,258,259,265,266]. Post-operative urethrocutaneous fistula (UCF) rates were 17.2% and 2.6% in the studies of Ekerhult et al., and Joshi et al., respectively, and either not reported or unclear in the remaining studies [255,256].
