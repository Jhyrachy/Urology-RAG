3.7.7. Summary of evidence and recommendations for the management of hypospadias. Summary of evidenceLEThe suggested age at surgery for primary hypospadias repair is 6-18 (24) months.3The therapeutic objectives are to correct the penile curvature, to form a neo-urethra of an adequate size, to bring the new meatus to the tip of the glans, if possible, and to achieve an overall acceptable cosmetic appearance.4Androgen stimulation therapy results in increased penile length and glans circumference.1bThe complication rate is about 10% in distal and 25% in proximal hypospadias one-stage repairs.3Higher and variable rates (between 28 and 68%) can occur in two-stage repairs.2bSexual functions are usually well preserved but patients report high levels of perception of deformity and social embarrassment. RecommendationsStrength ratingAt birth, differentiate isolated hypospadias from disorders of sex development which are mostly associated with cryptorchidism or micropenis.StrongCounsel caregivers on functional indications for surgery, aesthetically feasible operative procedures (psychological, cosmetic indications) and possible complications.StrongIn children diagnosed with proximal hypospadias and a small appearing penis, reduced glans circumference or reduced urethral plate, pre-operative hormonal androgen stimulation treatment is an option and the body of evidence to accentuate its harms and benefits is inadequate.WeakFor distal hypospadias, offer Duplay-Thiersch urethroplasty, original and modified tubularised incised plate urethroplasty; use the onlay urethroplasty or two-stage procedures in more severe hypospadias. A treatment algorithm is presented (Figure 4). Correct significant (> 30 degrees) curvature of the penis.WeakEnsure long-term follow-up to detect urethral stricture, voiding dysfunctions and recurrent penile curvature, ejaculation disorder, and to evaluate patientÂ´s satisfaction.StrongUse validated objective scoring systems to assist in evaluating the functional and cosmetic outcome.Strong
