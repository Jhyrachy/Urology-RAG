7.4.4. combination therapy. 7.4.4.1. intravesical bcg plus chemotherapy versus bcg alone one rct, combination mmc bcg shown effective reducing risk disease recurrence increasing toxicity compared bcg monotherapy. using similar bcg schedules groups, bcg instillation combination group preceded day added mmc instillation . rct using mmc emda, combination bcg mmc emda showed improved recurrence-free interval reduced progression rate compared bcg monotherapy . two meta-analyses demonstrated improved disease-free survival (dfs), benefit pfs patients treated combination treatment comparing bcg monotherapy . 7.4.4.2. combination treatment using interferon cochrane meta-analysis 4 rcts, combination bcg ifn-2α show clear difference recurrence progression bcg alone . one study, weekly mmc followed monthly bcg alternating ifn-2α showed higher probability recurrence compared mmc followed bcg alone . additionally, rct similar population nmibc comparing bcg monotherapy combination epirubicin inf two years showed latter significantly inferior bcg monotherapy preventing recurrence . 7.4.4.3. sequential chemotherapy instillations preclinical data suggest efficacy intravesical chemotherapy instillations improved combinations compared administration single agents . sequential (immediate) instillations gemcitabine docetaxel initially reported 2015 wake bcg-shortage also times limited access mitomycin . subsequently sequential chemotherapy combinations valrubicin docetaxel suggested . time, additional retrospective data accumulated sequential gemcitabine docetaxel instillations used patients recurring induction bcg bcg-unresponsive disease ; patients recurrence bcg-induction fulfilling criteria bcg-unresponsive disease ; also bcg-naïve high-risk patients . thus, patients bcg-unresponsive disease treatment standard (radical cystectomy) feasible due age and/or comorbidity patients unwilling accept radical surgery, sequential instillations gemcitabine docetaxel emerging treatment concept awaiting prospective scientific evaluation.
