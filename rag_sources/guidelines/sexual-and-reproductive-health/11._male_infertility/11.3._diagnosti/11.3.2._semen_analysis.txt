11.3.2. semen analysis. 6th edition manual examination processing human semen published july 2021 comprises three sections: i) semen examination; ii) sperm preparation cryopreservation; and, iii) quality assessment quality control. procedures semen examination divided: basic examinations, performed every laboratory, based standardised procedures evidence-based techniques.extended analyses, performed choice laboratory special request clinicians.advanced examinations. basic examination summary : assessment sperm numbers: laboratory stop assessing number sperm low concentrations (2 million/ml), suggested 5th edition, report lower concentrations, noting errors associated counting small number spermatozoa may high. recognised total sperm numbers per ejaculate (sperm output) diagnostic value sperm concentration; therefore, semen volume must measured accurately.assessment sperm motility: categorisation sperm motility reverted back fast progressively motile, slow progressively motile, non-progressively motile immotile (grade a, b, c d) presence (or absence) rapid progressive spermatozoa recognised clinically important.assessment sperm morphology: 6th edition recommended tygerberg strict criteria sperm adapted papanicolaou staining.assessment vitality performed samples, 60% spermatozoa immotile. extended examinations chapter contains procedures detect leukocytes markers genital tract inflammation, sperm antibodies, indices multiple sperm defects, sequence ejaculation, methods detect sperm aneuploidy, semen biochemistry sperm dna fragmentation. reference ranges reference limits lower fifth percentile distribution semen analysis values approximately 3500 men 12 countries contributed natural conception within 12 months trying represent limit fertile infertile men. general prediction live birth vivo well vitro, multiparametric interpretation entire men’s partner’s reproductive potential needed. reference values semen parameters represented table 40 . moreover, complex testing (e.g., sperm dna fragmentation) classic semen analysis may required everyday clinical practice, particularly men belonging couples recurrent pregnancy loss natural conception art men unexplained male infertility. although definitive conclusions cannot drawn, given heterogeneity studies, increased sperm dna damage associated pregnancy failure . table 40: lower reference limits (5th centiles 95% cis) semen characteristics parameter2021 lower reference limit(95% ci)semen volume (ml)1.4 (1.3-1.5)total sperm number (106/ejaculate)39 (35-40)sperm concentration (106/ml)16 (15-18)total motility (pr + np, %)42 (40-43)progressive motility (pr, %)30 (29-31)vitality (live spermatozoa, %)54 (50-56)sperm morphology (normal forms, %)4 (3.9-4.0)other consensus threshold valuesph> 7.2peroxidase-positive leukocytes (106/ml)< 1.0tests antibodies spermatozoamar test (motile spermatozoa bound particles, %)no evidence-based reference values. laboratory define normal reference ranges testing sufficiently large number fertile men.immunobead test (motile spermatozoa bound beads, %)no evidence-based reference limits.accessory gland functionseminal zinc (μmol/ejaculate)> 2.4seminal fructose (μmol/ejaculate)> 13seminal neutral α-glucosidase (mu/ejaculate)> 20 cis = confidence intervals;
