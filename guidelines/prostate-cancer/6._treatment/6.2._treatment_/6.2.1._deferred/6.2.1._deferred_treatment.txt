6.2.1. Deferred treatment (watchful waiting/active surveillance). As the prevalence of cancer cells in the prostate is so much higher than the risk of dying from PCa, together with the increased rate of early detection of small tumours after the introduction of PSA, there is a distinct risk of over-diagnosis and subsequent over-treatment of the disease (Chapter 3.1 Epidemiology) [8,12,469]. All available radical PCa treatment options may cause significant side effects so conservative treatment options are needed for patients with a low risk of PCa death or symptomatic progression from their PCa. Data from studies conducted on patients who did not undergo local treatment with up to 25 years of follow-up, with endpoints of OS and CSS, are available. Several series have shown a consistent CSS rate of 82–87% at ten years [470,471], and 80–95% for T1/T2 and ISUP grade group ≤ 2 PCas [472]. In three studies with data beyond 15 years, the CSS was 80%, 79% and 58% respectively [470,471,473], and two reported 20-year CSS rates of 57% and 32% [470,473]. The observed heterogeneity in outcomes is due to different inclusion criteria, with some older studies from the pre-PSA era showing worse outcomes [473]. In addition, many patients classified as ISUP grade group 1 would now be classified as ISUP grade group 2–3 based on the 2005 Gleason classification, suggesting that the above-mentioned results should be considered as minimal and current outcomes would be more favourable. Patients with well-, moderately- and poorly-differentiated tumours had 10-year CSS rates of 91%, 90% and 74%, respectively, correlating with data from a pooled analysis [472]. In screen-detected localised PCa there is also a lead-time bias, resulting in a higher rate of early detected PCa, but also an even higher risk of detecting clinically insignificant PCa that never would have caused any problems [469]. Cancer-specifc survival from untreated screen-detected PCa in patients with ISUP grade groups 1–2 is therefore likely to be even more favourable than for PCa detected of other reasons. Consequently, a high proportion of men with PSA-detected PCa are suitable for conservative management such as active surveillance (AS) or watchful waiting (WW). As the decision to choose WW is more independent from the tumour stage, and mainly dependent on patient factors/life expectancy, this approach may include patients of all ISUP grade groups (see Chapter 6.2.1.1). The high CSS rates of localised PCa requires that a life expectancy of at least ten years should be considered mandatory for any benefit from active treatment. Co-morbidity is as important as age in predicting life expectancy in men with PCa. Increasing co-morbidity greatly increases the risk of dying from non-PCa-related causes. In an analysis of 19,639 patients aged > 65 years who were not given curative treatment, most men with a CCI score ≥ 2 had died from competing causes at ten years follow-up regardless of their age at time of diagnosis. Tumour aggressiveness had little impact on OS suggesting that patients could have been spared biopsy and diagnosis of cancer. Men with a CCI score ≤ 1 had a low risk of death at ten years, especially for well- or moderately-differentiated lesions [452]. Additionally, in the ProtecT trial (see 6.2.1.2), prostate cancer-related death was 3% at 15 years compared to death from any cause in 21.7% of patients, numbers that have been further validated in two large population-based studies from Canada and Sweden [474-476]. Estimation of competing benefits of active versus conservative treatment and death from any cause at ten and 15 years can be estimated using the PREDICT Prostate tool (available from https://prostate.predict.nhs.uk/), which was developed using registry data from the UK with external validation and is endorsed by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in the UK [477]. This highlights the importance of assessing co-morbidity even before considering a biopsy, but also before advising a patient with a PCa diagnosis on the optimal treatment for him. There are two distinct strategies for conservative management that aim to reduce over-treatment: AS and WW (Table 6.2.1).
