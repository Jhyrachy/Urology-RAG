3.1. Epidemiology. Bladder cancer (BC) is the seventh most commonly diagnosed cancer in the male population worldwide, and it is the tenth when both genders are considered [7]. The worldwide age-standardised incidence rate (per 100,000 person/years) is 9.5 in men and 2.4 in women [7]. In the European Union, the age-standardised incidence rate is 20 in men and 4.6 in women [7]. Worldwide, the BC age-standardised mortality rate (per 100,000 person/years) is 3.3 for men vs. 0.86 for women [7]. Bladder cancer incidence and mortality rates vary across countries due to differences in risk factors, detection and diagnostic practices, and variations in access to, and delivery of, healthcare. Additionally, epidemiological variations have been attributed to differing methodologies and the quality of data from individual datasets [8]. The incidence and mortality of BC has decreased in some registries, possibly reflecting the decreased impact of causative factors [9]. Approximately 75% of patients with BC present with a disease confined to the mucosa (stage Ta, CIS) or submucosa (stage T1); in younger patients (< 40 years of age) this percentage is even higher [10]. Patients with TaT1 and CIS have a high disease prevalence due to long-term survival in many cases and lower risk of cancer-specific mortality compared to patients with T2-4 disease [7,8].
