3.2.5.1. Primary prostate pain syndrome. Pain is the main symptom in PPPS. As a common feature of primary chronic pain syndromes, no single aetiological explanation has been found. One explanation is that the condition probably occurs in susceptible men exposed to one or more initiating factors, which may be single, repetitive or continuous. Several of these potential initiating factors have been proposed, including infectious, genetic, anatomical, neuromuscular, endocrine, immune (including autoimmune), or psychological mechanisms. These factors may then lead to a peripheral self-perpetuating immunological, inflammatory state and/or neurogenic injury, creating acute and then chronic pain. A study showed that chronic but not acute histological inflammation of the prostate was significantly associated with symptomatic progression [125]. Based on the peripheral and the CNS, sensitisation involving neuroplasticity may lead to a centralised neuropathic pain state. This could also explain why tissue damage is not usually found in PPPS. There is growing evidence for a neuropathic origin and association with CNS changes of pain in PPPS, and anxiety appears to be a risk factor for its development [45].
