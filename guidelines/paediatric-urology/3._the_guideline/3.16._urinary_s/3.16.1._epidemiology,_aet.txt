3.16.1. Epidemiology, aetiology and pathophysiology. Paediatric stone disease is an important clinical problem in paediatric urology practice. Due to its recurrent nature, every effort should be made to discover the underlying metabolic abnormality so that it can be treated appropriately. The main goal is to maintain a stone-free state with close follow-up, although it may not be possible in some circumstances (e.g. oxalosis or nephrocalcinosis). Bladder stones are still common in under-developed areas of the world and are usually ammonium acid urate and uric acid stones, strongly implicating dietary factors [1041,1042]. Hypocitraturia is the most common metabolic abnormality, followed by hypercalciuria [1043]. Patients with augmented bladder constitute another important group with a risk of up to 15% [1044]. The incidence and characteristics of stones show a wide geographical variation in children. Although urinary stone disease is generally considered to be a relatively rare disease, it is quite common in some parts of the world. Paediatric stone disease is endemic in Turkey, Pakistan and in some South Asian, African and South American countries. However, recent epidemiological studies have shown that the incidence of paediatric stone disease is also increasing in the Western world [1045-1047]; especially in girls, Caucasian ethnicity, African Americans and older children [1048]. More than 70% of stones in children contain calcium oxalate, while infectious stones are found more frequently in younger children [1049]. The risk for stone recurrence among childhood stone formers has been reported to be 35-50%. No sex differences could be found regarding the stone recurrence risk [1050,1051].
