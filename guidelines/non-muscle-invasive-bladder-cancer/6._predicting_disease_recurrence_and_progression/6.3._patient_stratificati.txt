6.3. Patient stratification into risk groups. To be able to facilitate treatment recommendations, the Guidelines Panel recommends the stratification of patients into risk groups based on their probability of progression to muscle-invasive disease. The new risk group definitions provided in these EAU Guidelines are based on an individual patient data analysis in primary patients and the calculation of their progression scores (2021 EAU NMIBC scoring model) as presented in Sections 4.5 and 6.1.2) [227]. For calculation of the risk group in individual patients, either one, or both, of the WHO 1973 and WHO 2004/2016 classification systems may be used. The probability of progression at 5 years varies from less than 1% to more than 40% between the risk groups. For factors where individual patient data were not collected such as subtypes of UC, LVI, primary CIS and CIS in the prostatic urethra; literature data have been used to classify patients into risk groups. The clinical compositions of the new EAU NMIBC prognostic factor risk groups based on the WHO 2004/2016 or WHO 1973 classification systems are provided in Table 6.1. Applications for the web (www.nmibc.net), iOS and Android have been developed to facilitate determining a patient’s risk group in daily clinical practice. The individual probability of disease progression at 1, 5 and 10 years for the new EAU NMIBC risk groups is presented in Table 6.2. A single-centre study validated the EAU NMIBC 2021 scoring model in 529 patients who received BCG [238]. The authors found that the progression risk for the EAU 2021 high- and very high-risk groups were significantly lower in BCG-treated patients than that in Table 6.2 [227]. These lower risks may be attributed to the use of BCG. Table 6.1: Clinical composition of the new EAU NMIBC prognostic factor risk groups based on the WHO 2004/2016 or the WHO 1973 grading classification systems [227] Only one of the two classification systems (WHO 1973 or WHO 2004/2016) is required to use this table.If both classification systems are available in an individual patient, the Panel recommends using the risk group calculation based on the WHO 1973 as it has better prognostic value.The category of LG tumours (WHO 2004/2016) also includes patients with tumours classified as PUNLMP.Additional clinical risk factors are: age > 70; multiple papillary tumours; and tumour diameter > 3 cm.

Nevertheless: Based on data from the literature, all patients with CIS in the prostatic urethra, with subtypes of UC (see Section 4.8) or with LVI should be included in the very high-risk group.Patients with recurrent tumours should be included in the intermediate-, high-, or very high-risk groups according to their other prognostic factors.
