4.3. T1 subclassification. The depth and extent of invasion into the lamina propria (T1 sub-staging) has been demonstrated to be of prognostic value in retrospective cohort studies [48,49] (LE: 3). Its use is recommended by the most recent 2022 World Health Organization (WHO) classification [50,51]. T1 sub-staging methods are based either on micrometric (T1e and T1m) or histo-anatomic (T1a and T1b) principles; the optimal classification system, however, remains to be defined [52,53] .
