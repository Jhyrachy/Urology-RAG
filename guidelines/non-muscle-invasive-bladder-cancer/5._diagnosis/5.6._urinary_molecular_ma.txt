5.6. Urinary molecular marker tests. Driven by the low sensitivity of urine cytology in LG/G1 tumours, numerous urinary tests have been developed [110]. None of these markers have been accepted as routine practice by any clinical guidelines for diagnosis or follow-up. The following general statements can be drawn regarding the existing tests: Sensitivity is usually higher at the cost of lower specificity compared to urine cytology [106].Benign conditions and previous BCG instillations may influence the results of many urinary marker tests [111].Requirements for sensitivity and specificity of a urinary marker test largely depend on the clinical context of the patient (screening, primary detection, follow-up [high-risk, low/intermediate-risk]) [106].Several urinary biomarkers, assessing multiple targets, have been tested in prospective multicentre studies [112,113]. Four of the commercially available urine biomarkers, Cx-Bladder [114,115], ADX-BladderTM [116,117], Xpert Bladder® [118-120] and EpiCheckTM [112], although not tested in RCTs, have such high sensitivities and negative predictive values in the referenced studies for HG disease that these biomarkers may approach the sensitivity of cystoscopy. These 4 tests might be used in the initial diagnostic workup to avoid/implement cystoscopy [114,121,122], or in follow-up to replace or postpone cystoscopy [116,117,120,123]. See section 8 for more details on the use of urine markers in the follow up.In patients with negative cystoscopy and upper tract work-up, positive results of urine cytology or molecular urine tests such as UroVysion™ (FISH), Nuclear Matrix Protein (NMP)22®, Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor (FGFR)3/Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase (TERT) and microsatellite analysis may identify patients more likely to experience disease recurrence and possibly progression [124-131].
