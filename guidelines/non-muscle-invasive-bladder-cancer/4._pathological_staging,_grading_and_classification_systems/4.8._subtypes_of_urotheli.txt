4.8. Subtypes of urothelial carcinoma. Currently, the following differentiations of urothelial carcinoma (UC) are used [71,72]: 1. Pure UC (more than 90% of all cases);2. UC with partial (squamous-glandular or trophoblastic) divergent differentiation;3. UC with micropapillary divergent differentiation;4. UC with nested/microcystic divergent differentiation;5. UC with microtubular divergent differentiation;6. UC with large nested divergent differentiation;7. UC with plasmacytoid divergent differentiation;8. UC with lymphoepithelioma-like divergent differentiation;9. UC with giant cell, diffuse, undifferentiated divergent differentiation;10. UC with sarcomatoid divergent differentiation;11. some UCs with other rare differentiations;12. UCs with partial NE (neuroendocrine differentiation, % to be given);13. pure neuroendocrine carcinoma (including small and large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas. In the new WHO 2022 all subtypes are considered HG [51]. The percentage of subtype in the specimen should be reported since it has been shown to be of prognostic value [73]. The WHO 2022 classification considers all subtypes UC (LG and HG) with more than 5% of HG as a HG tumour [2,73-80].
