4.2.4.1.3.3. Long-term efficacy of pelvic floor muscle training. In a SR including nineteen studies, 1,141 women were followed-up for one to fifteen years after PFMT for SUI [328]. Meta-analysis was not performed due to high heterogeneity of outcome measures and training dosage (frequency, intensity, duration, and adherence). Only two studies provided interventions during follow-up. Losses to follow-up ranged between 0% and 39%. Long-term adherence to PFMT varied between 10% and 70%. Five studies reported that the initial success rate on SUI and MUI was maintained in the long term. Long-term success based on responders in the original trial varied between 41% and 85%. Surgery rates in the long term varied between 4.9% and 58%. It was concluded that short-term outcome of PFMT can be maintained at long-term follow-up without incentives for continued training, but there is a high heterogeneity in both interventional and methodological quality in short- and long-term PFMT studies [328].
