4.4. Physical examination and digital-rectal examination. Physical examination particularly focusing on the suprapubic area, the external genitalia, the perineum, and lower limbs should be performed. Urethral discharge, meatal stenosis, phimosis, and penile cancer must be excluded. 4.4.1. Digital-rectal examination and prostate size evaluation Digital-rectal examination (DRE) is the simplest way to assess prostate volume, but the correlation to prostate volume is poor. Quality-control procedures for DRE have been described [44]. Transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) is more accurate in determining prostate volume than DRE. There is an underestimation of prostate volume by DRE. The underestimation increases with increasing TRUS volume, particularly where the volume is > 30 mL [45]. A model of visual aids has been developed to help urologists estimate prostate volume more accurately [46]. One study concluded that DRE was sufficient to discriminate between prostate volumes > or < 50 mL [47]. Summary of evidenceLEPhysical examination is an integral part of a patientâ€™s medical evaluation.4Digital-rectal examination can be used to assess prostate volume and texture; however, the correlation to actual prostate volume is poor.3 RecommendationStrength ratingPerform a physical examination including digital rectal examination in the assessment of male LUTS.Strong
