6.3.5.1.3. Lower urinary tract reconstruction for non-traumatic posterior urethral stenosis.

The choice of LUT reconstruction will depend upon the length, location, calibre and aetiology of the stenosis, continence status, bladder function, previous radiotherapy, patient’s preference, and surgeon’s expertise.
