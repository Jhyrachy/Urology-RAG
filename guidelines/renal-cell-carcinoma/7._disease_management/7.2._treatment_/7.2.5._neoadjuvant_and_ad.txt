7.2.5. Neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy. Neoadjuvant therapy is currently under investigation and available in clinical trials. In the pre-surgical setting neoadjuvant TKI and immune checkpoint therapy demonstrated varying response rates between 7-59% in retrospective series and some phase II trials [449,464,465]. In a presurgical phase II trial in patients with vascular thrombus treatment with axitinib demonstrated a reduction in the level of tumour thrombus in 35% of patients (7/20) [464]. There is currently no evidence of a prolonged OS by neoadjuvant treatment and at present, the data do not support its use outside clinical trials. There is currently no evidence from a SR (including ten retrospective studies and two RCTs) that adjuvant radiation therapy increases survival [466]. The impact on OS of adjuvant tumour vaccination in selected patients undergoing nephrectomy for T3 renal carcinomas remains unconfirmed [467-471] (LE: 1b). A similar observation was made in an adjuvant trial of girentuximab, a monoclonal antibody against carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) (ARISER Study) [472]. At present, there is no OS data supporting the use of adjuvant VEGFR or mTOR inhibitors. Thus far, several RCTs comparing VEGFR-TKI or mTOR vs. placebo have been published [473-481]. Only S-TRAC, a trial of adjuvant sunitinib vs. placebo demonstrated a DFS benefit which was not reproduced in ASSURE, a trial of sunitinib and sorafenib vs. placebo. Due to an unfavourable AE profile and no survival advantage, none of these drugs are recommended [482]. 7.2.5.1. PD-1 Inhibition: Keynote-564 The Keynote-564 trial is the first trial to report positive primary endpoint data on DFS [483,484]. Keynote-564 evaluated pembrolizumab (17 cycles of 3-weekly therapy) vs. placebo as adjuvant therapy in 994 patients with intermediate (pT2, grade 4 or sarcomatoid, N0, M0; or pT3, any grade, N0, M0) or high risk (pT4, any grade, N0, M0; or pT any stage, and grade, or N+, M0), or M1 (no evidence of disease [NED] after primary tumour plus soft tissue metastases completely resected < one year from nephrectomy) disease. The median follow-up, defined as time from randomisation to data cut-off, was 24.1 months. The primary endpoint of DFS per investigator assessment was significantly improved in the pembrolizumab group vs. placebo (HR: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.53–0.87, p = 0.001). The estimated 24-month DFS rate was 77% vs. 68% for pembrolizumab and placebo, respectively. Benefit occurred across broad subgroups of patients including those with M1/NED disease post-surgery (n = 58 [6%]). Investigator assessed DFS was considered preferable to DFS by central review due to its clinical applicability. Overall survival showed a non-statistically significant trend towards a benefit in the pembrolizumab arm (HR: 0.54, 95% CI: 0.30-0.96, p = 0.0164). Follow-up was short and few OS events occurred (2-year OS rate of 97% [pembrolizumab] vs. 94% [placebo]). Grade III-V all-cause AEs occurred in 32% vs. 18% of patients for pembrolizumab and placebo, respectively. Quality of life assessment by FKSI-DRS and QLQ30 did not show a statistically significant or clinically meaningful deterioration in health-related QoL or symptom scores for either adjuvant pembrolizumab or placebo. 7.2.5.2. PD-L1 inhibition: IMmotion010 The IMmotion010 phase III trial was the first adjuvant ICI trial to be developed in RCC to investigate the effect of a PD-L1 inhibitor on DFS [485]. IMmotion010 evaluated atezolizumab 1200 mg (once every 3 weeks for 16 cycles or one year) vs. placebo as adjuvant therapy in 778 patients with increased risk of recurrence defined as: pT2, grade 4 or sarcomatoid, N0, M0; or pT3, grade 3–4, N0, M0; or pT3b/c/T4, any grade, N0, M0; or pT any stage and grade, pN1, M0, or M1 no NED after primary tumour plus soft tissue metastases completely resected either synchronous or if metachronous, > 12 months from nephrectomy. The minimum follow-up, defined as time from randomisation to data cut-off, was 38.6 months. The primary endpoint of DFS per investigator assessment was not met in the atezolizumab group vs. placebo (HR: 0.93, 95% CI: 0.75-1.15, p = 0.4950) with a median DFS of 57.2 months (95% CI: 44.6, NE) for atezolizumab vs. 49.5 months for placebo (47.4, NE). None of the exploratory subgroups suggested a DFS benefit with atezolizumab, most notably the M1 NED subgroup (n = 108/13.9%) which was larger than in Keynote-564 (5.8%), the sarcomatoid subgroup and the subgroup expressing > 1% PD-L1 had a HR of 0.93 (0.58–1.49), 0.77 (0.44–1.36) and 0.83 (0.63-1.10), respectively. There were no OS differences. Grade 3-4 all-cause and treatment-related AEs occurred in 27.2% and 14.1% vs. 21.1% and 4.7% of patients for atezolizumab and placebo, respectively. There were no treatment-related grade 5 AEs. 7.2.5.3. PD-1 and CTLA-4 inhibition: CheckMate 914 CheckMate 914 was the first phase III trial to investigate a combination of nivolumab plus ipilimumab vs. placebo as adjuvant treatment in RCC (part A) [486]. Subsequently, a nivolumab monotherapy arm was also added to the trial (part B). The following results relate to part A which evaluated nivolumab 240 mg every two weeks (Q2W) for 12 cycles or 6 months plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg Q6W for 4 cycles vs. placebo in 816 patients with recurrence risk defined as pT2a, grade 3 or 4, N0, M0; pT2b/T3/T4, any grade, N0, M0, or pT any stage, any grade, pN1, M0. The median time of follow-up, defined as time from randomisation to data cut-off, was 37 months. The primary endpoint of DFS per investigator assessment was not met in the nivolumab plus ipilimumab group vs. placebo (HR 0.92 [0.71-1.19], p = 0.5347). Of the exploratory subgroups, patients with sarcomatoid tumours (n = 40) and those with > 1% PD-L1 expression (n = 107) had a HR of 0.29 (0.09-0.91) and 0.46 (0.23-0.94) in favour of the ICI combination, respectively. All-cause treatment discontinuation due to study drug occurred in 43% and 33% in the nivolumab plus ipilimumab group vs. 11% and 1% in the placebo group. Treatment-related AE grade > III were 29% in the nivolumab plus ipilimumab group and 2% in the placebo group with four deaths (1%) considered related to combination therapy. The high AE profile may have contributed to the lack of efficacy and patient retention. The results of the nivolumab arm are awaited. 7.2.5.4. Perioperative PD-1 inhibition: PROSPER PROSPER is a peri-operative trial of neoadjuvant nivolumab (one cycle) followed by radical or partial nephrectomy and adjuvant nivolumab (480 mg IV q4 weeks) for nine doses compared to surgery followed by surveillance without a placebo [487]. Patients with clinical stage > T2 or T any N+ RCC or patients with selected oligometastatic disease were included if they had no evidence of disease within 12-weeks post- surgery. A total of 819 patients with clear cell (87%) and non-ccRCC were included, a biopsy in the nivolumab arm was mandatory. The primary endpoint of RFS was similar between the arms (HR: 0.97; 95% CI: 0.74-1.28; p = 0.43) and the trial was stopped by DSMC. The OS was not statistically different (HR: 1.48; 95% CI: 0.89-2.48; p = 0.93), although not mature. Grade III-IV AEs occurred in 20% (nivolumab arm) and 6% (control arm) of patients, respectively. Fifteen (4%) patients died in the nivolumab arm and eighteen (4%) in the surgery alone arm. Following the application of the EAU Guidelines methodology, the Panel reached consensus and issued a weak recommendation for adjuvant pembrolizumab for patients with high-risk (defined as per study) operable ccRCC until final OS data are available [488]. This decision was taken as immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy has a different mode of action than VEGFR-TKI resulting in complete responses in up to 16% of patients in PD-1 unselected populations in metastatic disease [489]. Despite immature OS data with the early OS signal potentially driven by the M1 population the Panel cannot exclude that a survival benefit will emerge. This was not the case in the adjuvant sunitinib trial (STRAC) [486,490]. The Panel took the following evidence limitations into account when deciding to make to a weak recommendation for adjuvant pembrolizumab: A high proportion of patients, cured by surgery, are receiving unnecessary, and potentially harmful treatment.The tolerability profile is acceptable but grade III-V AEs were higher with 14.7% in the pembrolizumab arm vs. the placebo arm (occurring in approximately one-third of patients, all cause). Approximately 18% of patients required treatment discontinuation early for AEs which gives a broad indicator of tolerability. There is a significant risk of life-changing toxicity.Other ICI trials have not shown consistent results.Biomarker analysis to predict outcome and AEs are not available.Final OS data are not yet available. The results of IMmotion010, CheckMate 914 and PROSPER need to be discussed with patients [485-487]. Meta-analysis with these data sets is not recommended due to heterogeneity across the ICI studies. It is likely that there are several reasons behind these inconsistent results, including study population with potential heterogeneity independent of TNM risk groups, selection criteria and trial design. To date pembrolizumab is the only positive trial [490]. While the results of IMmotion010 may reflect the non-significant OS results seen in the metastatic setting with PD-L1 inhibitors (IMmotion151, Javelin 101), the results of CheckMate 914 and PROSPER are more difficult to interpret. Nivolumab and ipilimumab leads to durable remission and long-term OS in metastatic disease and nivolumab has a similar mode of action as pembrolizumab (anti PD-1). The high treatment discontinuation rate of 33% in CheckMate 914 is of concern and may have had an impact on the trial effectivity (20% in Keynote-564). The Panel strongly feels that biomarker work on all of these trials should occur to identify patients that do respond to therapy and to give a better explanation for the inconsistent results. Treatment of unselected patients in the adjuvant setting based on the Keynote-564 criteria will result in a large proportion of patients receiving unnecessary therapy. In the absence of OS data or appropriate biomarkers, the patient preference should be leading in a shared decision-making process. Patients considering adjuvant therapy should be aware of all trials and not be presented with only one data set.
