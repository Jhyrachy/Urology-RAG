5.3. Pathophysiology. The pathophysiology of ED may be vasculogenic, neurogenic, anatomical, hormonal, drug-induced and/or psychogenic (Table 7) [282]. In most cases, numerous pathophysiological pathways can co-exist and may all negatively impact EF.

The analysis only assessed the short-term risk [283]. 5.3.1. Pelvic surgery and prostate cancer treatment Pelvic surgery, especially for oncological disease (e.g., radical prostatectomy (RP) [284], radical cystectomy [285] and colorectal surgery [286]), may have a negative impact on EF and overall sexual health. Surgery resulting in damage of the neurovascular bundles, that control the complex mechanism of the cavernous erectile response, may result in ED, although NS approaches have been adopted over the last few decades. To date only the surgical treatment of PCa has enough scientific evidence supporting its potential pathophysiological association with ED [287-289]. However, even non-surgical treatments of PCa (i.e., radiotherapy, or brachytherapy) can be associated with ED [287,290,291]. The ProtecT trial randomised 1,643 patients to active treatment (RP or RT) or active monitoring for localised PCa and assessed sexual function, including EF, using the EPIC-26 instrument [271]. At baseline, 67% of men reported erections firm enough for sexual intercourse. At the six year follow-up assessment this fell to 30% in the active monitoring group, 27%% in the RT group and 17% in the RP group, respectively. Radical prostatectomy for the treatment of clinically localised intermediate- or high-risk PCa is a widely performed procedure. Research has shown that 25-75% of men experience post-RP ED [272,273,288]. Conversely, the rate of unassisted post-operative EF recovery ranges between 20 and 25% in most studies. These rates have not substantially improved or changed over the past seventeen years, despite growing attention to post-surgical rehabilitation protocols and refinement of surgical techniques [273,274,292]. Overall, patient age, baseline EF and surgical volume, with the subsequent ability to preserve the neurovascular bundles, are the main factors in promoting the highest rates of post-operative EF [272,289,293,294]. Regardless of the surgical technique, surgeons’ experience clearly impacts on post-operative EF outcome [295]. The surgical approach may also affect post-RP EF, but the current evidence conflicts with one systematic review reporting a significant advantage in favour of RARP compared to open retropubic RP for twelve-month potency rates [296] and two RCTs reporting only a small improvement in EF for RARP or no different in EF between techniques [297,298]. Erectile dysfunction is also a common problem after both external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) and brachytherapy for PCa. A systematic review and meta-analysis including men treated with EBRT (65%), brachytherapy (31%) or both (4%) showed that the post-treatment prevalence of ED was 34% at one year and 57% at 5.5 years, respectively [299,300]. Similar findings have been reported for stereotactic radiotherapy with 26-55% of previously sexually functioning patients reporting ED at five years [301]. Recently other modalities have emerged as potential therapeutic options in patients with clinically-localised PCa, including high-intensity focused US (HIFU), cryo-therapeutic ablation of the prostate (cryotherapy), focal padeliporfin-based vascular-targeted photodynamic therapy and focal RT by brachytherapy or CyberKnife®. All these approaches have been reported to have a less-negative impact on EF with many studies reporting a complete recovery at one-year follow-up [302]. 5.3.2.
