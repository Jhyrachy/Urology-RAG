9.3.2.2. surgical treatment congenital intrinsic penile shortness. current literature reports wide spectrum possible surgical interventions aimed address penile shortness. nonetheless, proposed spectrum surgical interventions starts less invasive procedures - suspensory ligament release (slr) - complex genital reconstruction - total phallic reconstruction (tpr) . 9.3.2.2.1. suspensory ligament release (slr) technique involves surgical incision slr penis attaches penis pubic bone. surgical access via infrapubic incision may combined elongating v-y skin plasty . several authors reported outcomes slr context congenital intrinsic penile shortness (table 29). table 29: suspensory ligament release author (year)yearnstudy designage, yearsfollow-up, monthsstretched penile length gain, cmlittara et al. 201921retrospective38.08 ±1.1121.1zhang et al. 201915retrospective33.2 ± 4.634.3 ±1.6li et al.200627retrospectivenr161.1 ±1.1spyropouloset al. 200511retrospective25-25not reported1.6 (1–2.3) measurements expressed median/mean, (iqr)/±sd. 9.3.2.2.2. ventral phalloplasty/scrotoplasty intervention based ventral shaft skin plasty move peno-scrotal angle proximally increase exposure penile shaft. longitudinal incision z-plasty penoscrotal junction, securing tunica albuginea proximal tunica dartos performed xu et al. 41 patients . correction successful patients improved median length +2.1 cm flaccid state. 9.3.2.2.3. suprapubic lipoplasty/liposuction/lipectomy intervention aims reduce thickness suprapubic fat pad either minimally invasive approach (liposuction) surgically (lipectomy). flattening suprapubic fat pad aims increase penile shaft exposure. ghanem et al., performed liposuction ten patients using 50-cc syringe 3- 6-mm liposuction needle . amount fat removed ranged 325 850 ml mean 495.50 ± 155.39 ml. three (30%) patients satisfied post-operative result, five (50%) patients satisfied, one patient (10%) neither satisfied dissatisfied, one (10%) patient dissatisfied. patients dissatisfied. shaeer’s monsplasty technique investigated 20 patients . three months post-operatively, flaccid visible length 7.1 ± 2.1cm, 57.9% improvement length, erect visible length 11.8 ± 2.1cm, 32% improvement length. final follow-up (eighteen months) 73.1% improvement satisfaction rate detected. 9.3.2.2.4. total phallic reconstruction (tpr) represents complex genital reconstruction possible, aiming create new phallus neo-urethra. operation reserved severe penile insufficiency cases (e.g., congenital micropenis, exstrophy-epispadias complex) benefit balanced possible complications . lumen et al., treated seven male patients (aged 15 42 years) phalloplasty (6 radial forearm free flap 1 anterolateral thigh flap) implant surgery offered approximately 1 year phallic reconstruction . complications surgical formation neophallus. two complications reported early post-operative period. two patients developed urinary complications (stricture and/or fistula). patient satisfaction surgery high six cases moderate one case. four patients underwent penile implant surgery 50% subsequently removed. perovic et al., conducted tpr using musculocutaneous latissimus dorsi (mld) twelve patients . mean (range) follow-up 31 (6–74) months, penile size 16 (14–18) cm long 13 (11–15) cm circumference. flap loss partial skin necrosis. garaffa et al., reported series tpr using radial artery forearm free flap 16 patients bladder/cloacal exstrophy micropenis-epispadias complex . one patient distal third phallus lost due acute thrombosis arterial anastomosis immediately post-operatively. almost (93%) fully satisfied terms cosmesis size. urethral stricture fistula common complications, developed native neourethral anastomosis. successfully managed revision surgery. sexual intercourse achieved 11 12 patients underwent ppi. 9.3.2.2.5. summary evidence recommendations surgical treatment congenital intrinsic penile shortness summary evidenceleconsidering wide spectrum complexity surgical interventions aimed addressing penile shortness, surgery reserved high volume centres.4suspensory ligament release, ventral phalloplasty suprapubic lipoplasty/liposuction/lipectomy provide objective increase penile length.3suspensory ligament release, ventral phalloplasty suprapubic lipoplasty/liposuction/lipectomy associated significant incidence complications.3total phallic reconstruction provides satisfactory surgical functional outcomes men micropenis.3 recommendationsstrength ratingperform penile augmentation surgery high-volume centres.stronguse suspensory ligament release (slr), ventral phalloplasty suprapubic lipoplasty/liposuction/lipectomy address penile lengthening.weakextensively discuss possible complications related suspensory ligament release, ventral phalloplasty suprapubic lipoplasty/liposuction/lipectomy.stronguse total phallic reconstruction restore genital anatomy patients affected congenital micropenis.weak
