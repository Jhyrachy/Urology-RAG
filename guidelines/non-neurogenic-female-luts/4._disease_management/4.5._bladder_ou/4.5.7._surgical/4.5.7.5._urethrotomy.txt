4.5.7.5. Urethrotomy. Urethrotomy involves incision of the urethra endoscopically or using a urethrotome. It addresses the urethral narrowing by cutting open the scar tissue which is causing the obstruction [74,509,529,564]. A prospective study of ten women with urethral strictures investigated the effect of Otis urethrotomy to 40 Fr followed by six weekly dilatations. There was significant improvement in IPSS, QoL, voided volume, Qmax and PVR volume at six months. Only the improvements in PVR volume and QoL were maintained on long-term follow-up (mean 82 months) [565].
