6.4.3. Natural history of biochemical recurrence. Once a PSA recurrence has been diagnosed, it is important to determine whether the recurrence has developed at local or distant sites. A SR and meta-analysis investigated the impact of BCR on clinical endpoints and concluded that patients experiencing BCR are at an increased risk of developing distant metastases, PCa-specific and overall mortality [898]. However, the effect size of BCR as a risk factor for mortality is highly variable. After primary RP its impact ranges from HR 1.03 (95% CI: 1.004–1.06) to HR 2.32 (95% CI: 1.45–3.71) [899,900]. After primary RT, OS rates are approximately 20% lower at eight to ten years follow-up even in men with minimal co-morbidity [901,902]. Still, the variability in reported effect sizes of BCR remains high and suggests that only certain patient subgroups with BCR might be at an increased risk of mortality. The risk of subsequent metastases, PCa-specific- and overall mortality may be predicted by the initial clinical and pathologic factors (e.g., T-category, PSA, ISUP grade group) and PSA kinetics (PSA-DT and interval to PSA failure), which was further investigated by the SR [898]. For patients with BCR after RP, the following outcomes were found to be associated with significant prognostic factors: distant metastatic recurrence: positive surgical margins, high RP specimen pathological ISUP grade group, high pT category, short PSA-DT, high pre-SRT PSA;prostate-cancer-specific mortality: high RP specimen pathological ISUP grade group, short interval to biochemical failure as defined by investigators, short PSA-DT;overall mortality: high RP specimen pathological ISUP grade group, short interval to biochemical failure, high PSA-DT. For patients with BCR after RT, the corresponding outcomes are: distant metastatic recurrence: high biopsy ISUP grade group, high cT category, short interval to biochemical failure;prostate-cancer-specific mortality: short interval to biochemical failure;overall mortality: high age, high biopsy ISUP grade group, short interval to biochemical failure, high initial (pre-treatment) PSA. Based on this meta-analysis, proposal is to stratify patients into two risk categories since not all patients with BCR will have similar outcomes (see Table 6.4.1). The stratification into ‘EAU Low-Risk’ or ‘EAU High-Risk’ BCR after RP has recently been validated in a European cohort [903].
