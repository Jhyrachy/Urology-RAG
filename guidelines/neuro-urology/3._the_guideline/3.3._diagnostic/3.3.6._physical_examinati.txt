3.3.6. Physical examination and additional tests. In addition to a detailed patient history, attention should be paid to possible physical and intellectual disabilities with respect to the planned investigations [92,93]. Neuro-urological status should be described as completely as possible (Figure 2) [6]. Patients with a high spinal cord lesion or supraspinal neurological lesions may suffer from a significant drop in blood pressure when moved into a sitting or standing position. All sensations and reflexes in the urogenital area must be tested [6]. Furthermore, detailed testing of the anal sphincter and pelvic floor functions must be performed (Figure 2) [6,94]. It is essential to have this clinical information to reliably interpret later diagnostic investigations (Table 6). Additionally, urinalysis, blood chemistry, ultrasonography, post-void residual when indicated, incontinence quantification and were indicated free uroflowmetry, should be performed as part of the routine assessment of neuro-urological patients [6,95]. 3.3.6.1. Autonomic dysreflexia Autonomic dysreflexia (AD) is a sudden and exaggerated autonomic response to various stimuli generally manifests in patients with SCI or spinal dysfunction at or above level Th 6. It is defined by an increase in systolic blood pressure > 20 mmHg from baseline and it is usually accompanied by a severe headache, blurred vision, feeling of anxiety, heart rate changes, as well as above the lesion, perspiration, piloerection, warm skin and flushing and below the lesion, pallor, cold skin, and sweating in the lower part of the body [96,97]. Autonomic dysreflexia can have life-threatening consequences if not managed adequately. The stimulus can be distended bladder or bowel (e.g., iatrogenic stimuli during cystoscopy or urodynamics) [98], but it can also be secondary to any noxious stimulus (e.g., infected toenail or pressure sore) or after sexual stimulation. Figure 2: Lumbosacral dermatomes, cutaneous nerves, and reflexesThe physical examination includes testing sensations and reflexes mediated through the lower spinal cord. Abnormal findings would suggest a lesion affecting the lumbosacral segments; mapping out distinct areas of sensory impairment helps to further localise the site of the lesion. Distribution of dermatomes (areas of skin mainly supplied by a single spinal nerve) and cutaneous nerves over the perianal region and back of the upper thigh (A), the perineum [99] (B), male external genitalia [100] (C) and root values of lower spinal cord reflexes (D).

Summary of evidence and recommendations for history taking and physical examination Summary of evidenceLEEarly diagnosis and treatment are essential in both congenital and acquired neuro-urological disorders to prevent irreversible changes within the LUT.4An extensive general history is the basis of evaluation focusing on past and present symptoms including urinary, sexual, bowel and neurological function.4Assessment of present and expected future QoL is an essential aspect of the overall management of neuro-urological patients and is important to evaluate the effect of any therapy.2aQuality of life assessment should be completed with validated QoL questionnaires for neuro-urological patients.1aBladder diaries provide data on the number of voids, voided volume, urinary incontinence, and urgency episodes.3 RecommendationsStrength ratingTake an extensive general history, concentrating on past and present symptoms.StrongTake a specific history for each of the four mentioned functions - urinary, bowel, sexual and neurological.StrongPay special attention to the possible existence of alarm symptoms/signs (e.g. pain, infection, haematuria, fever) that warrant further specific diagnosis.StrongAssess quality of life when evaluating and treating neuro-urological patients.StrongUse available validated tools for urinary and bowel symptoms in neuro-urological patients.StrongUse MSISQ-15 or MSISQ-19 to evaluate sexual function in multiple sclerosis patients.StrongAcknowledge individual patient disabilities when planning further investigations.StrongDescribe the neurological status as completely as possible, sensations and reflexes in the urogenital area must all be tested.StrongTest the anal sphincter and pelvic floor functions.StrongPerform urinalysis, blood chemistry, bladder diary, post-void residual, incontinence quantification and urinary tract imaging as initial and routinary evaluation.Strong MSISQ 15/19 = Multiple Sclerosis Intimacy and Sexuality Questionnaire 15/19 question version.
