5.4. Summary of evidence and recommendations for the diagnostic assessment of RCC. Summary of evidenceLEContrast enhanced multi-phasic CT has a high sensitivity and specificity for characterisation and detection of RCC, invasion, tumour thrombus and mRCC.2aMagnetic resonance imaging has a slightly higher sensitivity and specificity for small cystic renal masses and tumour thrombi as compared to CT.2aContrast enhanced US has a high sensitivity and specificity for characterisation of renal masses.2aRenal mass biopsies are associated with reduced overtreatment of benign masses and offers patients additional information (i.e. grade, subtype) for an informed decision regarding optimal management.3Ultrasound, power-Doppler US and positron-emission tomography CT have a low sensitivity and specificity for detection and characterisation of RCC.2a RecommendationsStrength ratingUse multi-phasic contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of abdomen and chest for the diagnosis and staging of renal tumours.StrongOmit chest CT in patients with incidentally noted cT1a disease due to the low risk of lung metastases in this cohort.WeakUse magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to better evaluate venous involvement, reduce radiation or avoid intravenous CT contrast medium.WeakUse non-ionising modalities, including MRI and contrast-enhanced ultrasound, for further characterisation of small renal masses, tumour thrombus and differentiation of unclear renal masses, in case the results of contrast-enhanced CT are indeterminate.StrongOffer brain CT/MRI in metastatic patients when systemic therapy or cytoreductive nephrectomy is considered.WeakDo not routinely use bone scan and/or positron-emission tomography CT for staging of renal cell carcinoma.WeakPerform a renal tumour biopsy before ablative therapy and systemic therapy without previous pathology.StrongPerform a percutaneous biopsy in select patients who are considering active surveillance.WeakUse a coaxial technique when performing a renal tumour biopsy.StrongDo not perform a renal tumour biopsy of cystic renal masses unless a significant solid component is visible at imaging.StrongUse a core biopsy technique rather than fine needle aspiration for histological characterisation of solid renal tumours.Strong
