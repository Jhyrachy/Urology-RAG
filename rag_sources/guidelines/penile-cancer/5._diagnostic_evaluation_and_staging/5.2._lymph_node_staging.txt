5.2. lymph node staging. penile cancer metastasizes stepwise manner lymphatic system, initially inguinal nodes, pelvic nodes finally distant nodes . fewer 5% patients present distant metastases generally accompanied regional ln involvement. result, important prognostic factor survival penile cancer presence extent nodal metastases, 5-year css approximately 95%, 80%, 65% 35% n0, n1, n2 n3 disease, respectively . patients clinically node-negative groins (no suspicious palpable nodes, cn0), non-randomised controlled trial (rct) observed early ln surgery led 3-year survival rate 84% compared 35% receiving delayed ln surgery, ene incidence 20% compared 95% early vs. delayed surgery groups, respectively . therefore, detecting lymphatic spread early possible crucial element penile cancer management. since penile cancer disseminates inguinal lns first, initial ln staging focused identifying (micro)metastatic disease inguinal lns early possible, imaging distant metastases indicated clinically node-positive patients. 5.2.1. physical examination careful palpation groins enlarged/pathologic inguinal lns must part initial physical examination patients suspected penile cancer. however, reliable physical exmination challenging case obesity patients previous inguinal surgery. also, enlarged lns secondary infection primary tumour (rather metastasis) occur. use antibiotics aim resolve enlarged nodes may delay staging treatment recommended . based physical examination, patients divided without suspicious nodes physical examination (clinically node-negative, cn0), suspicious palpable nodes (clinically node-positive, cn+). case suspected pathologic lns palpation; number, location, size whether node fixed mobile, noted. 5.2.2. clinically node-negative patients (cn0) suspicious nodes present palpation (cn0), approximately 20-25% patients may still harbour occult metastases, additional staging warranted . 5.2.2.1. non-surgical staging options unfortunately, validated nomograms tumour markers reliably predict ln involvement. conventional imaging modalities us, computed tomography (ct) mri cannot detect micro-metastases, 18f-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose positron emission tomography (18fdg-pet) detect ln metastases < 10 mm [101-103]. therefore, imaging modalities limited value recommended routine use clinically node-negative patients aim identify small, sub-clinical, ln metastasis . however, imaging modalities value detect enlarged/abnormal nodes patients physical examination challenging (e.g., due obesity). centres offer dynamic sentinel node biopsy (dsnb) surgical staging option (see section 5.2.2.3.), inguinal us obtained prior dsnb. sonographically suspicious nodes detected, fine needle aspiration cytology (fnac) easily performed session confirm diagnosis inguinal ln metastasis . studies incorporating us + fnac initial investigation clinically node-negative patients prior surgical staging, reported sensitivity specificity 39% 100%, respectively. hence, negative us unreliable exclude ln metastasis clinically node-negative patients us combined surgical staging indicated. however, us + fnac positive, reduce need dsnb 10–13%, allowing additional staging therapeutic ln dissection earlier stage . therefore, recommended perform us + fnac clinically node-negative patients, surgical staging dsnb. 5.2.2.2. indications surgical staging since delayed treatment occult ln metastasis results lower css rate current non-invasive staging options (nomograms, imaging) reliable enough detect micrometastatic disease, invasive/surgical staging remains indispensable identify micro-metastasis nodal metastases become palpable/visible . however, surgical staging over-treatment majority patients since 20–25% clinically node-negative patients harbour occult metastasis. select patients especially risk nodal metastases, risk categories established based stage, grade differentiation, presence lymphovascular/perineural invasion primary tumour. well-differentiated (g1), pta, ptis pt1 tumours without lymphovascular/perineural invasion (pt1a) considered low-risk tumours. patients low-risk tumours, risk metastases low justify surgical staging. moderately differentiated (g2) pt1a tumours considered intermediate-risk associated 6–8% probability (micro-)metastatic ln disease, whereas pt1b g2 tumours, risk 22–30%. therefore, tumours stage t1b, higher, considered high-risk tumours . based predictors, surgical staging recommended high-risk tumours (t1 presence lympho-vascular invasion, peri-neural invasion poorly differentiated, t2–t4 grade). intermediate-risk tumours (pt1a g2), risk ln metastasis balanced morbidity surgical staging case-by-case basis. 5.2.2.3. surgical staging options definition, radical inguinal lymph node dissection (ilnd) accurate surgical staging method. however, ilnd also associated highest complication rates (see section 6.2 - ln management). lower morbidity maintaining sufficient sensitivity, modified ilnd templates developed (consisting shorter skin incision; dissection lateral femoral artery caudal fossa ovalis, preservation saphenous vein) . however, modified ilnd still associated considerable complication rates 35–49% false-negative rates 15–20% . recently, video-endoscopic/robot-assisted radical lnd introduced (see section 6.2 - ln management). initial reports indicate reduction mainly wound-related complications compared open ilnd . however, significant reduction lymphatic complications expected since main predictor lymphatic complications shown number removed lns [114-116], ln yield video-endoscopic approach comparable open ilnd . avoid resecting unnecessary lns thereby minimising morbidity surgical staging, dsnb developed . sentinel node (sn) defined first ln direct drainage pathway primary tumour. based concept, assumed sn negative, indicates absence lymphatic tumour spread corresponding inguinal basin. case histopathology identifies sn (micro)metastasis, ipsilateral completion ilnd indicated (see section 6.2.2) . dynamic sn biopsy typically performed using combination radioactive tracer patent blue dye order achieve optimal visualization lymphatic drainage system prior surgery. recent innovations include incorporation single-photon emission computed tomography/ct (spect/ct) hybrid radioactive fluorescent tracers . throughout years, procedure matured reliable staging technique high diagnostic accuracy low complication rates, especially performed experienced centres (sensitivity 92–96%, false-negative rates 4–8%, complication rate 6–14%) . recent meta-analysis reported higher pooled false-negative rate 12% showed false-negative rate lower high-volume centres . might indicate potential learning curve supports call centralisation penile cancer care. dsnb available, referral centre experience dsnb feasible, patient want run risk false-negative procedure, ilnd (modified/superficial/video-endoscopic) considered informing patient inherent risk higher morbidity associated procedures. 5.2.3. clinically node-positive patients (cn+) patients palpable nodes, nodal metastases present approximately 45–80% cases . lymph node metastasis preferably histopathologically confirmed image-guided biopsy (e.g., us ct). cn0 patients abdominal thoracic imaging recommended (see section 5.2.2.1), value cn+ patients clinically stage pelvis exclude distant metastases. computed tomography chest/abdomen broadly available, however ct sensitivity 20–38% detection pelvic lns. magnetic resonance imaging constitutes another diagnostic staging modality;
