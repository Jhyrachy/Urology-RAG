7.2. Office-based fulguration and laser vaporisation. In patients with a history of small Ta LG/G1 tumours, fulguration, or laser vaporisation of small papillary recurrences on an outpatient basis can reduce the therapeutic burden [246,247]. In a prospective RCT, laser photocoagulation with intravesical lidocaine in an outpatient setting proved non inferior to standard TURB under general anaesthesia for the 4 months recurrence rate. Notably, the laser fulguration procedure resulted in only a modest pain score (2.4) and was preferred by 98% of patients [248].
