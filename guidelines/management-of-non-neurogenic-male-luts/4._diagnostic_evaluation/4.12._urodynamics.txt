4.12. Urodynamics. In male LUTS, the most widespread invasive urodynamic techniques employed are filling cystometry and pressure flow studies (PFS). The major goal of urodynamics (UDS) is to explore the functional mechanisms of LUTS, to identify risk factors for adverse outcomes and to provide information for shared decision-making. Most terms and conditions (e.g., DO, low compliance, BOO/BPO, DU) are defined by urodynamic investigation. 4.12.1. Diagnosing bladder outlet obstruction Pressure flow studies are used to diagnose and define the severity of BOO, which is characterised by increased detrusor pressure and decreased urinary flow rate during voiding. Bladder outflow obstruction/BPO has to be differentiated from DU, which exhibits decreased detrusor pressure during voiding in combination with decreased urinary flow rate [3]. Bladder outlet obstruction is calculated according to the equation pdetQmax–2Qmax (BOO>40 = obstructed; BOO 20-40 = equivocal; and BOO<20 = unobstructed) [102], and to assess the contractility of the bladder, BCI is calculated according to the equation PdetQmax+5Qmax [103] (BCI>150 = strong contractility, 100-150 = normal contractility, and < 100 weak contractility) [83]. Urodynamic testing may also identify DO. Studies have described an association between BOO and DO [104,105]. In men with LUTS attributed to BPO, DO was present in 61% and independently associated with BOO grade and ageing [104]. The prevalence of DU in men with LUTS is 11-40% [106,107]. Detrusor contractility does not appear to decline in long-term BOO and surgical relief of BOO does not improve contractility [108,109]. The UPSTREAM trial investigated whether urodynamics would reduce surgery without increasing urinary symptoms. UPSTREAM was a non-inferiority, RCT in men with bothersome LUTS, in whom surgery was an option, in 26 hospitals in England. In the UDS arm, 153/408 patients (38%) received surgery compared with 138/384 (36%) in the routine care (RC) arm. A total of 428 adverse events were recorded, with related events similar in both arms and eleven unrelated deaths. The UDS group was non-inferior to the RC group for IPSS, and UDS did not significantly reduce surgical rates. The authors concluded that routine use of UDS in the evaluation of uncomplicated LUTS has a limited role and should be used selectively [110]. However, in a prospective cohort study of urodynamically assessed patients prior to surgery, patients with DU alone with Bladder Contractility Index (BCI) [BCI] < 100 and BOO index [BOOI] < 40 had significantly worse outcome with regard to post-operative maximum flow rate at twelve month than those DU and BOO with BCI < 100 and BOOI ≥ 40) as well as patients with BOO alone with and BCI ≥ 100 and BOOI ≥ 40) [111]. Nevertheless, if urodynamic investigation is performed, a rigorous quality control is mandatory [112,113]. Exploratory findings from the UPSTREAM Trial have characterised the basic diagnostic and urodynamic parameters to identify men who will benefit more from de-obstructive surgery [114]. The Investigators reported that surgery was more beneficial in those men with higher symptom scores (IPSS>16), age<74yr, poor urine flow (Qmax < 10ml/s), bladder outlet obstruction index > 47.6 and bladder contractility index > 123. Due to the invasive nature of the test, a urodynamic investigation is generally only offered if conservative and medical treatment have failed. The Guidelines Panel attempted to identify specific indications for UDS based on age, findings from other diagnostic tests and previous treatments. The Panel allocated a different degree of obligation for UDS in men > 80 years and men < 50 years, which reflects the lack of evidence. In addition, there was no consensus whether UDS should or may be performed when considering surgery in men with bothersome predominantly voiding LUTS and Qmax > 10 mL/s, although the Panel recognised that with a Qmax < 10 mL/s, BOO is likely and UDS is not necessarily needed. Patients with neurological disease, including those with previous radical pelvic surgery, should be assessed according to the EAU Guidelines on Neuro-Urology [115]. 4.12.2. Videourodynamics Videourodynamics provides additional anatomical and functional information and may be recommended if the clinician considers this is needed to understand the pathophysiological mechanism of an individual patient’s LUTS. There is only low-level evidence for the addition of imaging to UDS.
