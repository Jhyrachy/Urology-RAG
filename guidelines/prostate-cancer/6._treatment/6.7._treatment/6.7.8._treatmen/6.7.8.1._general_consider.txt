6.7.8.1. General considerations. For men progressing quickly on AR targeted therapy (< twelve months) it is now clear that cabazitaxel is the treatment supported by the best data. The CARD trial, an open label randomised phase III trial, evaluated cabazitaxel after docetaxel and one line of ARPI (either AAP or enzalutamide) [1164]. It included patients progressing in less than twelve months on previous abiraterone or enzalutamide for mCRPC. Cabazitaxel more than doubled rPFS vs. another ARPI and reduced the risk of death by 36% vs. ARPI. The rPFS with cabazitaxel remained superior regardless of the ARPI sequence and if docetaxel was given before, or after, the first ARPI. The choice of further treatment after docetaxel and one line of HT for mCRPC is open for patients who have a > twelve months response to first-line abiraterone or enzalutamide for mCRPC [1184]. Either second-line chemotherapy (cabazitaxel), radium-223 (if bone-only metastases), 177Lu–PSMA-617 radioligand therapy [1221,1222] and PARP inhibitors (if BRCA mutation) are valuable options. Men previously treated with at least one ARPI or both an ARPI and docetaxel and whose tumours demonstrated homozygous deletions or deleterious mutations in DNA-repair genes showed an 88% response rate to olaparib [1223] and in another confirmatory trial a composite response of 54.3% (95% CI: 39.0–69.1) in the 400 mg cohort and in 18 of 46 (39.1%; 25.1–54.6) evaluable patients in the 300 mg cohort [1224]. See also section ‘Second-line management’). In general, subsequent treatments in unselected patients are expected to have less benefit than with earlier use [1225,1226] and there is evidence of cross-resistance between enzalutamide and abiraterone [1227,1228].
