7.2.4. Management of locally-advanced unresectable RCC. The management of locally-advanced unresectable RCC should be based around systemic therapy [460].A multidisciplinary evaluation, including urologists, medical oncologists and radiation therapists is suggested to maximise cancer control, pain control and the best supportive care. In patients with non-resectable disease, embolisation can control symptoms, including visible haematuria or flank pain [309,461-463]. 7.2.4.1. Summary of evidence and recommendations for lymph node dissection, the management of RCC with venous tumour thrombus and unresectable tumours Summary of evidenceLEIn patients with locally-advanced disease, the survival benefit of LN dissection is unproven but LN dissection has significant staging, prognosis, adjuvant therapy and follow-up implications.3Low quality data suggest that tumour thrombus excision in non-metastatic disease may be beneficial.3 RecommendationsStrength ratingDuring nephrectomy, remove clinically enlarged lymph nodes for staging, prognosis and follow-up implications.WeakRemove the renal tumour and thrombus in case of venous involvement in non-metastatic disease.StrongDiscuss treatment options in patients with locally-advanced unresectable RCC (biopsy and/or systemic therapy/deferred resection, or palliative management) within a multidisciplinary team to determine treatment goal.Strong
