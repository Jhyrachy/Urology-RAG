3.2.5.2. Primary bladder pain syndrome. An initial unidentified insult to the bladder, leading to urothelial damage, neurogenic inflammation and pain is thought to be a trigger of PBPS. However, PBPS might be a local manifestation of a systemic disorder. No infection has as yet been implicated. Nevertheless, urinary infections are significantly more frequent during childhood and adolescence, in patients with PBPS in adulthood [126]. Experimental induction of chronic pelvic pain by O-antigen deficient bacterial strains supports the bacterial hypothesis [127]. Pancystitis, with associated perineural inflammatory infiltrates, and mast cell count increase is an essential part of PBPS type 3 C [128], but is rare in non-lesion PBPS [33,68,129,130]. Cystoscopic and biopsy findings in both lesion and non-lesion PBPS are consistent with defects in the urothelial glycosaminoglycan (GAG) layer, which might expose submucosal structures to noxious urine components [131-135] and a consequent cytotoxic effect [136,137]. Basic and clinical studies indicate that autonomic dysfunction with sympathetic predominance may be implicated in PBPS [138,139]. An association has been reported between PBPS and non-bladder syndromes such as FM, CFS, IBS, vulvodynia, depression, panic disorders, migraine, sicca syndrome, temporomandibular joint disorder, allergy, asthma and systemic lupus erythematosus [140-145]. Psychological comorbidities, especially depression, has been found to be related to symptom severity [140]. Risk of PBPS correlates with a number of non-bladder syndromes in each patient [146]. Recent work showing non-lesion PBPS to have significantly more FM, migraine, temporomandibular joint disorder and depression than PBPS type 3 C patients, which emphasises, the need for subtyping [147].
