6.4.4. Treatment for bladder stones secondary to bladder outlet obstruction in adult men. Bladder stones in men aged over 40 years may be caused by BPO, the management of which should also be considered. Bladder stones were traditionally an indication for a surgical intervention for BPO: a doctrine that has been questioned by studies. One prospective study reports urodynamics (cystometrogram) findings in 46 men aged > 60 years before and after bladder stone treatment [711]. Only 51% of men had BOO while 10% had detrusor under-activity. Eighteen percent of men had a completely normal urodynamic study and 68% had detrusor over-activity. There was no significant difference between pre- and post-bladder stone removal urodynamic findings [711]. One NRS compared 64 men undergoing transurethral cystolithotripsy with either transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) or medical management for BPO (Î±-blocker with or without 5-alpha reductase inhibitor). After 28 months of follow-up, no men on medication had had a recurrence, but 34% underwent TURP: a high post-void residual urine volume predicted the need for subsequent TURP [756]. Another observational study of 23 men undergoing cystolithotripsy and commencing medical management for BPO found 22% developed a BPO-related complication, including 17% who had recurrent stones [733]. One RCT comparing cystolithotripsy with concomitant TURP to cystolithotripsy with medical management of bladder outlet obstruction with Tamsulosin and finasteride demonstrated that both groups had a significantly improved QMax, IPSS, and PVR at follow-up, although the TURP group had a longer procedure and catheterisation time [757]. Large prostates and a high PVR (> 190 ml) were predictive of needing a TURP over time in the medical management cohort, although this was based on only a small number of patients. Large studies support the safety of performing BPO and bladder stone procedures during the same operation with no difference in major complications compared to a BPO procedure alone [758-760]. An observational study on 2,271 patients undergoing TURP found no difference in complications except UTIs, which occurred slightly more frequently in patients with simultaneously treated bladder stones: 0% vs. 0.6%, p=0.044 [758]. An observational study of 321 men undergoing Holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP) found a higher rate of early post-operative incontinence (26.8% vs. 12.5%, p=0.03) in men having concomitant transurethral cystolithotripsy, but no difference in long-term continence rates [760]. Another larger multicenter observational study of 963 patients undergoing HoLEP found no significant differences in the frequency of complications in patients with (n=54 [5.6%]) or without concomitant transurethral cystolithotripsy [761].
