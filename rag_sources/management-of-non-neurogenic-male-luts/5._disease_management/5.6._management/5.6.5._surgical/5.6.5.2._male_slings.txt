5.6.5.2. male slings. male slings introduced treat mild-to-moderate ppi. however, definitions mild moderate ui unclear. majority studies define cure ‘no pad use’ ‘one security pad per 24-hours’. authors used strict criteria ‘urine loss less 2 g per 24-hour pad test’ . 5.6.5.2.1. non-adjustable slings mechanism action: non-adjustable male slings positioned urethra fixed retropubic transobturator approach. tension adjusted surgery, cannot re-adjusted post-operatively. synthetic slings restore continence males either urethral compression and/or repositioning bulb urethra . efficacy: sr meta-analysis involving 33 prospective cohorts one rct comparing sling aus, reported options effective improving ui qol . following sling insertion, overall cure rate 60% (95% ci: 0.51-0.67) 56% (95% ci: 0.44-0.68) sling aus respectively. 24-hour pad use -3.33 (95% ci: -4.33 -2.34) -3.75 (95% ci: -4.56 -2.93) slings aus, respectively. similar findings reported network meta-analysis showed comparable efficacy slings aus . master trial, non-inferiority rct comparing outcomes continence surgery men bothersome urodynamic sui, using strict definition ui prostate surgery, reported twelve-months continence rates 87% male sling vs. 84.2% aus (95% ci: -11.6-4.6, pni=0.003]), confirming non-inferiority . subgroup analysis suggested male sling inferior aus men greater incontinence baseline (pad weight > 250g); however, difference reach statistical significance. re-positioning sling (advance™ advancexp©), mean subjective cure rate 49% (8.6 - 73.7%) mean follow-up three years reported 136 patients . prospective multicentre cohort study, 60-month follow-up, men advancexp demonstrated constant continence outcome time 57.6% cure rate, 25.4% improvement rate 16.9% failure rate. findings verified additional study reported cure rates 66.7% 71.7%, improvement rates 26.5% 24.4% failures rates 6.9% 13.3% 24- 48-months, respectively . retrospective comparative study showed options safe effective treatment male sui . transobturator compressive i-stop toms male sling, 38% men dry twelve months, reduced 23% 15% four five years, respectively . tolerability safety: sr meta-analysis 1,170 men sui male sling, reported predictors failure prior radiation, severity incontinence previous surgeries . pelvic radiotherapy also reported studies negative prognostic factor . comparison among radiated vs. non-radiated men advancexp reported greater degree post-operative improvement non-radiated group (49.6% vs. 22.2%) well greater satisfaction rates (95% vs. 64%) . common complication male slings pain local superficial wound infection . chronic pain observed 1.3% men non-adjustable slings . post-operative transient voiding dysfunction occurred 4.3-10.3%, mostly de novo urgency urinary retention, erosions chronic pain uncommon (0-0.4%), explantation . practical considerations: fixed male slings considered safe improve continence, efficacy limited men severe incontinence previous radiotherapy. 5.6.5.2.2. adjustable slings males mechanism action: adjustable slings males tension sling adjusted post-operatively. three main systems used men: remeex® system , argus® system atoms® system . efficacy: one small rct adjustable slings males . studies consist prospective retrospective case series, variable follow-up different definitions success [688,690-694]. sr reported objective cure rates varying 17-92% adjustable sling implantation . remeex® system, two studies, conflicting findings, published. one study followed nineteen patients nearly seven years reported 70% success, explants, infections, erosions . second study followed fourteen patients 25 months. 36% patients satisfied multiple re-adjustments needed. mechanical failure reported 21% . data argus® system reported 404 men, series reported 40 patients, longest follow-up 35-months. success rates varied 17-93%, mean 73.0% reporting subjective cure . head-to-head comparison two argus systems reported similar efficacy outcomes 44 months, argus associated higher inguinal pain explantation rate . small study 22 men ppi randomised advance argus reported superior 24-hour pad test results patient satisfaction levels argus eighteen-months follow-up . sr atoms system reported pooled evidence 1,393 patients 67% dryness, 90% improvement adjustment 16.4% complication rate . expulsion rate 5.75%. another sr meta-analysis 3,059 patients reported atoms superior proact mean dryness rate (68% vs. 55%), overall improvement (91% vs. 80%), satisfaction rate (87% vs. 56%), mean number filing adjustments (2.4 vs. 3.5) post-operative pad use per day (1.1 vs. 2.1) . tolerability safety: frequent complications adjustable male slings pain, erosions, infections . pain implant site usually temporary, chronic pain reported 1.5% men . number implants requiring re-adjustment reported 8-38.6% . explantation rates range 10-15.8% erosion rate estimated around 10% . common reasons explantation device infection (4.1-8%), erosions (4-12%), urethral perforations (2.7-16%). sr reported device explantation rate 5% vs. 25% major complication rate 4.2% vs. 10.4% atoms proact, respectively . practical considerations: evidence adjustability offers additional benefit rcts lacking; therefore, recommendation made time. explantation rate seems superior fixed male sling based external comparisons. 5.6.5.2.3. autologous slings strategy intra-operative placement autologous vas deferens sling vesico-urethral anastomosis robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy (rarp) explored intention improve early return continence. two rcts showed advantage sling vs. sling one-month follow-up, another study showed advantage 6-branch vs. 2-branch sling one month follow-up. however, larger rct (n=195), showed continence rate near-continence rate similar groups six months 66% vs. 65% 86% vs. 88%, respectively . summary evidencelethere limited short-, medium- long-term evidence fixed transobturator male slings cure improve ppi patients mild-to-moderate incontinence.1bmen severe incontinence, previous radiotherapy transurethral surgery may less benefit fixed transobturator male slings.2there limited evidence adjustable male slings cure improve sui men.3there evidence adjustability offers additional benefit types slings.3explantation rate adjustable male slings seems superior fixed male sling based external comparisons.4there evidence intra-operative placement autologous sling rarp improves return continence six months.1b recommendationsstrength ratingoffer non-adjustable transobturator slings men mild-to-moderate* post-prostatectomy incontinence.weakinform men severe incontinence, prior pelvic radiotherapy transurethral surgery may worsen outcome non-adjustable male sling surgery.weak * terms “mild” “moderate” ppi remain undefined.
