6.1.1. Treatment of superficial non-invasive disease (PeIN, Ta). Penile intra-epithelial neoplasia can progress to invasive lesions in 2.6–13% of patients, despite treatment; hence, definitive eradication and diligent follow-up monitoring are important [127-129]. Most PeIN lesions are located on the mucosal surfaces of the glans or prepuce whilst lichen sclerosus also affects the prepuce [128]. Thus, circumcision should be the primary surgical option [129]. Following circumcision, the glans mucosa keratinizes over a period of 3–6 months and any residual PeIN or lichen sclerosus may resolve. Close monitoring before starting additional therapy has been advocated, but to date, data supporting this concept are limited [129]. Considering a median time to progression to malignancy of thirteen months [128], this approach seems reasonable to test in future clinical trials. 6.1.1.1. Topical therapies Topical therapy with imiquimod (IQ) or 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) are effective non-invasive first-line treatment options which use is increasingly reported [130]. 5-Fluorouracil exerts its effects through inhibition of the enzyme thymidylate synthase. Although no standard protocol exists, leaving the 5-FU ointment on for 12 hours every 48 hours during a 4 to 6-week treatment course is often recommended in reported series of PeIN therapy [131]. Imiquimod acts through several pathways including activation of immune cells via toll-like receptor 7, creating an inflammatory response, and is commonly used 3 times per week for 12 weeks. There is no consensus or comparative data on the optimal treatment schedules for these therapies and the evidence for these treatments is heterogenous as it only relies on retrospective studies. A SR based on the aforementioned low-quality data illustrated that topical agents showed response- and recurrence rates of 40–100% and 20% for IQ, vs. 48–74% and 11% for 5-FU, respectively [132]. Because use of 5-FU typically results in marked erythema, erosions, and crust lasting for a month or longer, decreased patient compliance with treatment regimens may result in diminished effectiveness. Similarly, IQ use is complicated by the resultant tissue effects, including erythema, oedema and erosions, ulceration and crust, that are not consistent from one individual to the next [133]. Discontinuation of topical agents because of side effects was observed in 12% of cases [132]. It is advised that treatment effects must be clinically assessed and in cases of doubt evaluated by biopsy and long-term surveillance is warranted. Insufficient responses and recurrences may signify underlying invasive disease, hence, if topical treatment fails, it should not be repeated. 6.1.1.2. Laser ablation Laser ablation is an alternative treatment option. Energy-based therapies discussed in the literature include Neodymium:Yttrium-Aluminium-Garnet (Nd:YAG, penetration 4–61398042195mm, wavelength 1064 nm) or Carbon dioxide (CO2, penetration < 1 mm, wavelength 10600 nm) lasers and photodynamic therapy [134]. Laser treatment has shown total response rates of 52–100% with recurrence reported in 7–48% of patients [132]. Altered penile sensitivity following laser treatment has been described, including increased sensitivity in 50% and decreased sensitivity in 15% of patients. Reports show relatively high rates of local recurrence, possibly owing to inadequate penetration, difficulties in assessing borders of affected areas and missing lesions that have invaded the subepithelial tissue [10,135,136]. Repeat laser treatment for recurrence has been described in some series without compromising long-term oncological outcomes, which is likely a result of the low risk of the lesions treated in those series [137,138]. For cryotherapy, with or without topical therapy, and photodynamic therapy, which induces photo-selective cell death, there are only limited data for the treatment of PeIN. 6.1.1.3. Surgery Extensive PeIN, residual PeIN in resection margins or recurrent disease after ablative or topical therapy, can be treated by surgical excision. Glans resurfacing consists of full thickness removal of the glandular epithelium followed by reconstruction with a graft (split skin [139] or buccal mucosa for urethral reconstruction [140]). Grafts tend to have excellent engraftment rates on this well-vascularized wound bed [141]. Recurrences are reported to be low (0–20%) and cosmesis is acceptable [139,141,142]. If feasible, preservation of the coronal ridge helps maintain sexual function and provides excellent cosmetic outcomes as shown by a small retrospective report [143]. Resection, as opposed to ablative or topical treatments, provides the advantage of complete histopathological local staging and detection of areas of invasion; in one study in cases of glans resurfacing for presumed PeIN, up to 20% of patients were found to have invasive disease on histopathological examination [139]. Surgeons and pathologists are urged to discuss appropriate specimen handling (e.g., pinning down the skin as resected) and pathological reporting of these cases to aid further management and avoid over-reporting of positive margins [144].
