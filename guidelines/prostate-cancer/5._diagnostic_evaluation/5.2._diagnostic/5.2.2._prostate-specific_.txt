5.2.2. Prostate-specific antigen. Prostate-specific antigen (a glycoprotein enzyme secreted by prostate epithelial cells) is the primary test in the suspicion of PCa. Its use as a serum marker has revolutionised PCa diagnosis [161]. Prostate-specific antigen is organ- but not cancer specific; therefore, it may be elevated in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), prostatitis and other non-malignant conditions. There are no agreed standards for defining PSA thresholds [162]. It is a continuous parameter, with higher levels indicating greater likelihood of PCa. Some men may harbour PCa despite having low serum PSA [163]. Table 5.2 demonstrates the occurrence of any PCa and ISUP ≥ grade 2 PCa in systematic biopsies at low PSA levels, precluding an optimal PSA threshold for detecting non-palpable but csPCa. Table 5.2: Risk of PCa identified by systemic PCa biopsy in relation to low prostate-specific antigen values [163] PSA level (ng/mL)Risk of PCa (%)Risk of ISUP grade > 2 PCa (%)0.0–0.56.60.80.6–1.010.11.01.1–2.017.02.02.1–3.023.94.63.1–4.026.96.7 In a screening situation, the most commonly applied threshold for PSA is ≥ 3.0 ng/ml, resulting in 16.5% of invited men returning a positive test [164]. The risk of finding PCa at a specific PSA threshold in a clinical cohort may be different than in a screening situation, due to differences in prevalence, protocol for referral, and diagnostic algorithm. PSA keeps its diagnostic value for cancer detection in symptomatic patients [165]. A review and meta-analysis on the diagnostic accuracy of PSA (≥ 4.0 ng/ml) for the detection of PCa transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) in clinical patients found an estimated combined sensitivity of 0.93 and specificity of 0.20 PSA production is androgen dependent and 5a-reductase inhibitors (e.g. finasteride, dutasteride) used for benign prostatic enlargement of the prostate such as finasteride or dutasteride will reduce PSA levels by 50% [166]. In such cases, PSA level should be corrected before a decision about further investigation is made. In case of a moderately elevated PSA (up to 10 ng/mL), a repeated test after a few weeks should be considered to confirm the increase before going to continue the diagnostic analysis. Repeat PSA should be performed in the same laboratory using the same assay under standardised conditions (i.e. no ejaculation, manipulations, and urinary tract infections [UTIs]) [167,168]. The type of PSA assay used may impact PSA values and rates of PSA above certain fixed thresholds [169]. A repeat PSA test before prostate biopsies in men with an initial PSA 3–10 ng/mL reduced the indication for biopsies in 16.8% of men while missing 5.4% ISUP grade > 1 in the Stockholm3 trial [170]. Similarly, in the Prostate Testing for Cancer and Treatment (ProtecT) trial men with a more than 20% lower repeat-PSA analysis within seven weeks had a lower risk of PCa (OR: 0.43, 95% CI: 0.35–0.52) as well as a lower risk of ISUP grade ≥ 2 (OR: 0.29, 95% CI: 0.19–0.44) [171]. A study with a PSA interval of four weeks showed similar findings of a reduced risk of PCa and ISUP grade > 1 [172]. These observations indicate that an early repeat-PSA prior to the decision of prostate biopsies has prognostic information.
