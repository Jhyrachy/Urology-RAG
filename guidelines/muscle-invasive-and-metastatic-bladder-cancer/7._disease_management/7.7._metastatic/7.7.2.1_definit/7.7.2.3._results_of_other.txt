7.7.2.3. Results of other trials integrating immunotherapy in the first line setting without OS benefit. In 2020, the results of three phase III trials were published investigating the use of immunotherapy in the first-line setting for platinum-eligible patients. The first trial to report was IMvigor130 investigating the combination of the PD-L1 inhibitor atezolizumab plus platinum-gemcitabine chemotherapy vs. chemotherapy plus placebo vs. atezolizumab alone [514]. The primary endpoint of PFS benefit for the combination vs. chemotherapy alone in the ITT group was reached (8.2 months vs. 6.3 months [HR: 0.82, 95% CI: 0.70â€“0.96; one-sided, p = 0.007]) while OS was not significant at the interim analysis after a median follow-up of 11.8 months. The small PFS benefit in the absence of an OS benefit has raised questions of its clinical significance. The KEYNOTE 361 study had a very similar design using the PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab plus platinum-gemcitabine vs. chemotherapy plus placebo vs. pembrolizumab alone. The results of the primary endpoints of PFS and OS for the comparison of pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy vs. chemotherapy plus placebo in the ITT population showed no benefit for the combination [515]. DANUBE compared the immunotherapy combination (IO-IO) of CTLA-4 inhibitor tremelimumab and PD-L1 inhibitor durvalumab with chemotherapy alone or durvalumab alone [516]. The co-primary endpoint of improved OS for the IO-IO combination vs. chemotherapy was not reached in the ITT group nor was the OS improved for durvalumab monotherapy vs. chemotherapy in the PD-L1-positive population. In conclusion, unlike CheckMate 901, these three trials do not support the use of combination of the PD-1/L1 checkpoint inhibitors plus platinum-based chemotherapy or the IO-IO combination as first-line treatment.
