11.8. Psychosocial aspects in men’s infertility. Male infertility impacts men’s psychological well-being resulting in emotional distress and challenges men’s sense of identity. Is worth noting that a failed treatment often results in a prolonged grief response, requiring post-treatment psychological support [1924]. The mental health expert is thus regarded as part of the infertility intervention team, acting in all intervention stages, using strategies that may range from psycho-education techniques to more comprehensive psycho-therapeutic approaches [1925]. Furthermore, there should be a deeper focus on preventive policies; It has been recognised that men, such as women, want to become parents. Yet, they have very limited knowledge on infertility related risk factors, including a lack of awareness on the age-related decline in fertility, and tend to overestimate the chance of spontaneous conception [1926,1927].
