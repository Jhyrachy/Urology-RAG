7.7.2.1 Definitions: ‘Fit for cisplatin, fit for carboplatin, unfit for any platinum-based chemotherapy’. An international survey among BC experts [432] was the basis for a consensus statement on how to classify patients unfit for cisplatin-based chemotherapy. At least one of the following criteria must be present: PS > 1; GFR ≤ 60 mL/min; grade ≥ 2 audiometric hearing loss; grade ≥ 2 peripheral neuropathy or New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III heart failure [433]. Around 50% of patients with BC are not eligible for cisplatin-based chemotherapy [433]. Renal function assessment is of utmost importance for treatment selection. Measuring GFR with radioisotopes (99mTc DTPA or 51Cr-EDTA) is recommended in equivocal cases. Cisplatin has also been administered in patients with a lower GFR (40–60 mL/min) using different split-dose schedules. The respective studies were mostly small phase I and II trials in different settings (neoadjuvant and advanced disease) demonstrating that the use of split-dose cisplatin is feasible and appears to result in encouraging efficacy [486,489,490]. However, no prospective RCT has compared split-dose cisplatin with conventional dosing. Most patients that are deemed unfit for cisplatin are able to receive carboplatin-based chemotherapy. However, some patients are deemed unfit for any platinum-based chemotherapy, i.e. both cisplatin and carboplatin. Patient are unfit for any platinum-based chemotherapy in case of PS > 2, GFR < 30 mL/min or the combination of PS 2 and GFR < 60 mL/min since the outcome in this patient population is poor regardless of platinum-based treatment or not [491]. Patients with multiple comorbidities may also be poor candidates for platinum-based chemotherapy.
