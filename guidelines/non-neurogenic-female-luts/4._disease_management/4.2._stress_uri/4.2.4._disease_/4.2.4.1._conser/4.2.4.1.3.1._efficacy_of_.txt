4.2.4.1.3.1. Efficacy of pelvic floor muscle training. A Cochrane review compared PFMT with no treatment or inactive control treatment and found that women with SUI in the PFMT groups were eight times more likely to report cure [316]. The review also documented significant improvement in SUI and improvement in UI QoL. Pelvic floor muscle training reduced leakage by an average of one episode per day in women with SUI. Women with SUI in the PFMT groups lost significantly less urine in short (up to one-hour) pad tests. The comparison of short pad tests showed considerable heterogeneity, but the findings still favoured PFMT when using a random-effects model. Women in the PFMT group were also more satisfied with treatment and their sexual outcomes were better. Adverse events were rare and minor. A Cochrane review concluded that there may be some additional effect of adding biofeedback to PFMT. However, this was based on RCTs with training frequency and attention favouring biofeedback [317]. In a recent RCT (61.3% had MUI) comparing the exact same training dosage and attention between groups, use of biofeedback did not yield any additional effect [318]. Group training is cost-effective in treatment of SUI/UI compared to individual treatment [319]. Another Cochrane review concluded that combination of individual assessment/education and group training was equally effective compared to individual treatment, but again the dosage and attention differed between comparison groups [320]. In a more recent RCT with the exact same training dosage and attention in individual and group training, group training was not inferior to individual treatment [319]. It is worth noting that all of the PFMT interventions in these reviews follow individual assessment and teaching before starting PFMT, and most interventions use some sort of measurement tool (biofeedback) in the assessment. Both the Cochrane review and the ICI concluded that the use of vaginal cones to train the PFMs is more effective than no treatment, but it is inconclusive whether it is more or less effective than structuredPFMT [316,321,322]. Some women are unable to maintain the cone inside, and some report discomfort and motivation problems and adherence may be low [321]. The Cochrane review [316], the ICI [322] and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines (2019) [66] all conclude that there is the highest level evidence (1a) to support PFMT in the treatment of SUI/MUI. All SRs conclude that PFMT is less effective if women with MUI and UUI are included in the studies and more effective with more intensive and supervised training. According to the NICE guidelines literature review, PFMT is as effective as surgery for around half of women with SUI, and due to the risks following surgery and absence of adverse effects of PFMT, they recommend three months of supervised PFMT as first-line treatment for SUI and MUI [66]. Pelvic floor muscle training was compared to synthetic MUS surgery in an RCT involving 460 women with moderate to severe SUI [323]. Crossover between treatment arms was allowed and 49% of women in the physiotherapy group and 11.2% of women in the surgery group crossed over to the alternative treatment. Subjective improvement was reported by 90.8% of women in the surgery group and 64.4% of women in the physiotherapy group at twelve months [323].
