5.8. Cystoscopy. The diagnosis of papillary BC ultimately depends on cystoscopic examination of the bladder and histological evaluation of sampled tissue by either cold-cup biopsy or resection. Carcinoma in situ can be suspected through cystoscopy and urine cytology and confirmed by histological evaluation of multiple bladder biopsies [135]. Cystoscopy can be performed as an outpatient procedure. A flexible instrument with topical intraurethral anaesthetic lubricant instillation results in better compliance compared to a rigid instrument, especially in men [136,137]. To temporary increase the urethral pressure by irrigation ‘bag squeeze’ when passing membranous and prostatic urethra with a flexible cystoscope in males also decreases pain during the procedure [138,139].
