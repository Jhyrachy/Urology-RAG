11.4.4. male accessory gland infections infertility. 11.4.4.1. introduction infection male urogenital tract potentially curable cause male infertility [1769-1771]. considers urethritis, prostatitis, orchitis epididymitis male accessory gland infections (magis) . effect symptomatic asymptomatic infections sperm quality contradictory . systematic review relationship sexually transmitted infections, caused chlamydia trachomatis, genital mycoplasmas, neisseria gonorrhoeae, trichomonas vaginalis viruses, infertility unable draw strong association sexually transmitted infections male infertility due limited quality reported data . 11.4.4.2. diagnostic evaluation 11.4.4.2.1. semen analysis semen analysis (see section 11.3.2) clarifies whether prostate involved part generalised magi provides information regarding sperm quality. 11.4.4.2.2. microbiological findings exclusion uti (including urethritis), > 106 peroxidase-positive white blood-cells (wbcs) per millilitre ejaculate indicate inflammatory process. semen culture polymerase chain reaction (pcr) analysis performed common urinary tract pathogens suspected cases genitourinary tract infections. concentration > 103 cfu/ml urinary tract pathogens ejaculate indicative significant bacteriospermia . sampling delivered day laboratory sampling time influence rate positive micro-organisms semen frequency isolation different strains . ideal diagnostic test isolating c. trachomatis semen yet established , accurate method pcr [1777-1779]. historical data show ureaplasma urealyticum pathogenic high concentrations (> 103 cfu/ml ejaculate). fewer 10% samples analysed ureaplasma exceeded concentration . normal colonisation urethra hampers significance mycoplasma-associated urogenital infections, using samples ejaculate . meta-analysis indicated ureaplasma parvum mycoplasma genitalium associated male infertility, significant relationship existed u. urealyticum (or: 3.03 95% ci: 1.02–8.99) mycoplasma hominis (or: 2.8; 95% ci: 0.93– 3.64) . reasons, treatment always recommended. prevalence human papilloma virus (hpv) semen ranges 2 31% general population higher men unexplained infertility (10-35.7%) . systematic reviews reported association male infertility, poorer pregnancy outcomes semen hpv positivity [1785-1787]. however, data still needs prospectively validated clearly define clinical impact hpv infection semen. additionally, seminal presence herpes simplex virus (hsv)-2 infertile men may associated lower sperm quality compared hsv-negative infertile men . however, unclear anti-viral therapy improves fertility rates men. 11.4.4.2.3. white blood cells clinical significance increased concentration leukocytes ejaculate controversial . although leukocytospermia sign inflammation, necessarily associated bacterial viral infections, therefore cannot considered reliable indicator . according classification, leukocytospermia defined > 106 wbcs/ml. two studies analysed alterations wbcs ejaculate patients proven prostatitis . studies found leukocytes men prostatitis compared without inflammation (cpps, type nih 3b). furthermore, leukocytospermia confirmed performing peroxidase test semen. currently evidence treatment leukocytospermia alone without evidence infective organisms improves conception rates . 11.4.4.2.4. sperm quality deleterious effects chronic prostatitis (cp/cpps) sperm density, motility morphology demonstrated recent systematic review based case-controlled studies . c. trachomatis ureoplasma spp. cause decreased sperm density, motility, altered morphology increased dna damage. data retrospective cross-sectional study showed u. urealyticum frequent single pathogen semen asymptomatic infertile men; positive semen culture univariably (p < 0.001) multi-variably (p = 0.04) associated lower sperm concentration . human papilloma virus associated changes semen density, sperm motility sperm dna damage . mycoplasma spp. cause decreased motility development antisperm antibodies . 11.4.4.2.5. seminal plasma alterations seminal plasma elastase biochemical indicator polymorphonuclear lymphocyte activity ejaculate . various cytokines involved inflammation influence sperm function. several studies investigated association interleukin (il) concentration, leukocytes, sperm function different pathways, correlations found [1797-1799]. prostate main site origin il-6 il-8 seminal plasma. cytokines, especially il-6, play important role male accessory gland inflammatory process . however, elevated cytokine levels depend number leukocytes expressed prostatic secretion . 11.4.4.2.6. glandular secretory dysfunction secretory function prostate gland evaluated measuring seminal plasma ph, citric acid, γ-glutamine transpeptidase levels, although parameters evaluated anymore numerous laboratories; seminal plasma concentrations factors usually altered infection inflammation. however, recommended diagnostic markers magis . 11.4.4.2.7. reactive oxygen species reactive oxygen species may increased infertile patients asymptomatic c. trachomatis m. hominis infection, subsequent decrease ros upon antibiotic treatment. however, ros levels infertile patients asymptomatic c. trachomatis m. hominis semen low, making difficult draw firm conclusions . chronic urogenital infections also associated increased leukocyte numbers . however, biological significance prostatitis remains unclear . 11.4.4.2.8. disease management antibiotic therapy chronic bacterial prostatitis (nih ii according classification) provided symptomatic relief, eradication micro-organisms, decrease cellular humoral inflammatory parameters urogenital secretions. although antibiotics might improve sperm quality , evidence treatment cp/cpps increases probability natural conception . asymptomatic presence c. trachomatis m. hominis semen correlated impaired sperm quality, recovers antibiotic treatment. however research required confirm findings . 11.4.4.3. epididymitis inflammation epididymis causes unilateral pain swelling, usually acute onset. among sexually active men aged < 35 years, epididymitis often caused c. trachomatis n. gonorrhoea . sexually transmitted epididymitis usually accompanied urethritis. non-sexually transmitted epididymitis associated utis occurs often men aged > 35 years . 11.4.4.3.1. diagnostic evaluation 11.4.4.3.1.1. ejaculate analysis ejaculate analysis according laboratory manual examination processing human semen (6th edn) criteria, may indicate persistent inflammatory activity. transient reductions sperm counts progressive sperm motility observed . semen culture might help identify pathogenic micro-organisms. development stenosis epididymal ducts, reduction sperm count, azoospermia important potential sequelae consider follow-up bilateral epididymitis (see section 11.3.2). 11.4.4.3.1.2. disease management treatment epididymitis results in: microbiological cure infection;improvement clinical signs symptoms;prevention potential testicular damage;prevention transmission;decrease potential complications (e.g., infertility chronic pain). patients epididymitis known suspected caused n. gonorrhoeae c. trachomatis must told also refer sexual partners evaluation treatment . 11.4.4.4 summary evidence recommendation male accessory gland infections summary evidencelemale accessory gland infections clearly associated impaired natural conception.3antibiotic treatment often eradicates micro-organisms; positive effect inflammatory alterations cannot reverse functional deficits anatomical abnormalities.2aalthough antibiotic treatment magis may result improvement sperm quality, enhance probability conception.2adata insufficient conclude whether antibiotics antioxidants treatment infertile men leukocytospermia improve fertility outcomes.3 recommendationsstrength ratingtreating male accessory gland infections may improve sperm quality, although necessarily improve probability increasing conception.weakrefer sexual partners patients accessory sex gland infections known suspected caused sexually transmitted diseases evaluation treatment.strong
