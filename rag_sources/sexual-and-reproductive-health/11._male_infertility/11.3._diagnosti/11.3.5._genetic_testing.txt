11.3.5. genetic testing. urologists working andrology must understanding genetic abnormalities commonly associated infertility, provide correct advice couples seeking fertility treatment. current routine clinical practice genetic testing based screening genomic dna peripheral blood samples. however, screening chromosomal anomalies spermatozoa (sperm aneuploidy) preimplantation genetic testing (pgt) also feasible indicated selected cases (e.g., recurrent miscarriage) [1584-1590]. 11.3.5.1. chromosomal abnormalities chromosomal abnormalities numerical (e.g., trisomy) structural (e.g., inversions translocations). survey pooled data 11 publications, including 9,766 infertile men, incidence chromosomal abnormalities 5.8% . these, sex chromosome abnormalities accounted 4.2% autosomal abnormalities 1.5%. comparison, incidence abnormalities 0.38% pooled data three series, total 94,465 new-born male infants, 131 (0.14%) sex chromosomal abnormalities 232 (0.25%) autosomal abnormalities . frequency chromosomal abnormalities increases testicular deficiency becomes severe. patients sperm count < 5 million/ml already show 10-fold higher incidence (4%) mainly autosomal structural abnormalities compared general population . men noa highest risk, especially sex chromosomal anomalies (e.g., klinefelter syndrome) . based frequencies chromosomal aberrations patients different sperm concentration, karyotype analysis currently indicated men azoospermia oligozoospermia (spermatozoa < 10 million/ml) . notwithstanding, clinical value spermatozoa < 10 million/ml remains valid threshold studies, evaluating cost-effectiveness, costs adverse events due chromosomal abnormalities (e.g., miscarriages children congenital anomalies) performed . 11.3.5.1.1. sex chromosome abnormalities (klinefelter syndrome variants ) klinefelter syndrome common sex chromosomal abnormality . adult men klinefelter syndrome usually small firm testes along features primary hypogonadism. phenotype final result combination genetic, hormonal age-related factors . phenotype varies normally virilised male one stigmata androgen deficiency. cases infertility reduced testicular volume clinical features detected. leydig cell function also commonly impaired men klinefelter syndrome thus testosterone deficiency frequently observed general population , although rarely observed peri-pubertal period, usually occurs normal manner . rarely, pronounced signs symptoms hypogonadism present, along congenital abnormalities including heart renal problems . presence germ cells sperm production variable men klinefelter syndrome frequently observed mosaicism, 46,xy/47,xxy. patients azoospermia, tese mtese therapeutic options spermatozoa recovered 50% cases . although data unique , growing evidence tese mtese yields higher sperm recovery rates performed younger age . since klinefelter syndrome associated several general health problems, appropriate medical follow-up therefore advised . testosterone therapy may considered testosterone levels hypogonadal range fertility issues addressed . moreover, men klinefelter syndrome higher risk metabolic cardiovascular diseases (cvd), including venous thromboembolism (vte) diabetes, particularly starting testosterone therapy . addition, higher risk haematological malignancies reported men klinefelter syndrome . testicular sperm extraction peri-pubertal pre-pubertal boys klinefelter syndrome aiming cryopreservation testicular spermatogonial stem cells still considered experimental performed within research setting . applies sperm retrieval older boys considered fertility potential . 11.3.5.1.2. autosomal abnormalities genetic counselling offered couples seeking fertility treatment (including ivf/icsi) male partner autosomal karyotype abnormality. common autosomal karyotype abnormalities robertsonian translocations, reciprocal translocations, paracentric inversions, marker chromosomes. important look structural chromosomal anomalies increased associated risk aneuploidy unbalanced chromosomal complements foetus. ivf/icsi carried men translocations, pgd amniocentesis performed . 11.3.5.2. cystic fibrosis gene mutations cystic fibrosis (cf) autosomal-recessive disorder . common genetic disease caucasians; 4% carriers gene mutations involving cf transmembrane conductance regulator (cftr) gene located chromosome 7p. encodes membrane protein functions ion channel influences formation ejaculatory duct, seminal vesicle, vas deferens distal two-thirds epididymis. approximately 2,000 cftr mutations identified cftr alteration may lead congenital bilateral absence vas deferens (cbavd). however, homozygous mutations exhibit cf disease . congenital bilateral absence vas deferens rare reason male factor infertility, found 1% infertile men 6% men obstructive azoospermia . clinical diagnosis absent vasa easy miss men azoospermia carefully examined exclude cbavd, particularly semen volume < 1.0 ml acidic ph < 7.0 [1614-1616]. patients cbavd-only cf, epididymal sperm aspiration (micro percutaneous;
