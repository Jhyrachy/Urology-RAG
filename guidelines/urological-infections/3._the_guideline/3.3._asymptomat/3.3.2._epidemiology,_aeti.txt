3.3.2. Epidemiology, aetiology and pathophysiology. Asymptomatic bacteriuria occurs in an estimated 1-5% of healthy pre-menopausal females. Increasing to 4-19% in otherwise healthy elderly females and men, 0.7-27% in patients with diabetes, 2-10% in pregnant women, 15-50% in institutionalised elderly populations, and in 23-89% in patients with spinal cord injuries [25]. Asymptomatic bacteriuria in younger men is uncommon, but when detected, chronic bacterial prostatitis must be considered. The spectrum of bacteria in ABU is similar to species found in uncomplicated or complicated UTIs, depending on the presence of risk factors (see sections 3.4 and 3.7).
