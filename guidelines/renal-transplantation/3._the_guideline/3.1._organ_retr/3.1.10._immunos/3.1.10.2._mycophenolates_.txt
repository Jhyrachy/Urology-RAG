3.1.10.2. Mycophenolates (MPA). The mycophenolates, MMF and EC-MPS, are based on mycophenolic acid, which inhibits inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) [285-289]. This is the rate-limiting step for the synthesis of guanosine monophosphate in the de novo purine pathway. As the function and proliferation of lymphocytes is more dependent on de novo purine nucleotide synthesis compared to other cell types, IMPDH inhibitors may provide more specific lymphocyte-targeted immunosuppression. The co-administration of mycophenolate with prednisolone and CNI has resulted in a profound reduction of biopsy-proven rejections [243,246,285-289]. Mycophenolic acid is not nephrotoxic; however, it inhibits bone marrow function and may cause CMV infections and gastrointestinal side effects, particularly diarrhoea [243,246,285-289]. There is also a higher incidence of polyoma nephropathy, especially when mycophenolate is combined with tacrolimus [290]. Both MPA formulations are equally effective with an almost identical safety profile [241,280,283,285-288], though some prospective studies suggest a better gastrointestinal side-effect profile for EC-MPS in patients who have suffered from MMF-related gastrointestinal complaints, although firm evidence from prospective randomised studies is lacking [285-289,291]. Mycophenolic acid is recommended by guidelines [244]. Standard doses in combination with cyclosporine are MMF 1 g or EC-MPS 720 mg twice daily, although higher initial doses have been suggested [243,244,285-289]. Despite its frequent use with tacrolimus, there is insufficient evidence to support the optimal dosage for this combination [243,285,287,288,292]. Tacrolimus has no influence on MPA exposure and leads to approximately 30% higher MPA exposure compared to cyclosporine. Most transplant centres use the same starting dose as in cyclosporine-treated patients, however dose reductions are frequent, especially because of gastrointestinal side effects. Weak evidence suggests that MPA dose reductions are associated with inferior outcomes, especially in cyclosporine treated patients [286-288,293,294]. Due to the high incidence of side effects, some centres perform a protocol-driven MPA dose reduction in tacrolimus treated patients [285,287]. Regular monitoring for polyoma (BK virus) is recommended in patients given MPA combined with tacrolimus [243,290]. Due to a higher incidence of CMV disease with MPA [289], either CMV prophylaxis or a pre-emptive strategy with regular screening for CMV viraemia should be instituted [243,295]. Cytomegalovirus prophylaxis with antiviral medications (e.g. valganciclovir) should be used routinely in CMV positive recipients and in CMV negative recipients of CMV positive organ transplants, because prophylaxis has recently been shown to reduce CMV disease, CMV-associated mortality in solid organ transplant recipients, and leads to better long-term graft survival in kidney allograft recipients. The benefit for MPA drug monitoring is uncertain and currently not recommended for the majority of patients [285,287,288,296]. In maintenance patients, the potency of MPA can be used for successful steroid withdrawal in most patients [297] or for substantial dose reductions of nephrotoxic CNIs, which may lead to better renal function [243-246,248,280,298]. Although there have been several studies of the potential for CNI-free protocols with MPA and steroids, complete CNI avoidance or withdrawal over the first three years has been associated with a substantially increased rejection risk and even worse outcomes in prospective randomised studies [243,245,280]. In contrast, CNI withdrawal under MPA and steroids appeared to be safe in long-term maintenance patients beyond five years post-transplant and resulted in improved renal function [243,245,248,280,298,299].
