7.4.3.1. Immune checkpoint inhibitors. 7.4.3.1.1. Immuno-oncology monotherapy Immune checkpoint inhibitor with monoclonal antibodies targets and blocks the inhibitory T-cell receptor PD-1 or cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4)-signalling to restore tumour-specific T-cell immunity [559]. Immune checkpoint inhibitor monotherapy has been investigated as second- and third-line therapy. A phase III trial of nivolumab vs. everolimus after one or two lines of VEGF-targeted therapy for mRCC with a clear cell component (CheckMate 025, NCT01668784) reported a longer OS, better QoL and fewer grade 3 or 4 AEs with nivolumab than with everolimus [560]. Nivolumab has superior OS to everolimus (HR: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.57-0.93, p < 0.002) in VEGF-refractory RCC with a median OS of 25 months for nivolumab and 19.6 months for everolimus with a 5-year OS probability of 26% vs. 18% [561] (LE: 1b). Patients who had failed multiple lines of VEGF-targeted therapy were included in this trial making the results broadly applicable. The trial included 15% MSKCC poor-risk patients. There was no PFS advantage with nivolumab despite the OS advantage. Progression-free survival does not appear to be a reliable surrogate of outcome for PD-1 therapy in RCC. Currently PD-L1 biomarkers are not used to select patients for this therapy. There are no RCTs supporting the use of single-agent ICI in treatment-naive patients. Randomised phase II data for atezolizumab vs. sunitinib showed a HR of 1.19 (95% CI: 0.82-1.71) which did not justify further assessment of atezolizumab as single agent as first-line treatment option in this group of patients, despite high complete response rates in the biomarker-positive population [562]. Single-arm phase II data for pembrolizumab from the KEYNOTE-427 trial show high response rates of 38% (up to 50% in PD-L1+ patients), but a PFS of 8.7 months (95% CI: 6.7-12.2) [562]. Based on these results and in the absence of randomised phase III data, single-agent checkpoint inhibitor therapy is not recommended as an alternative in a first-line therapy setting. In addition, several trials explored the strategy of nivolumab monotherapy in first-line ccRCC followed by a salvage strategy with nivolumab plus ipilimumab upon progression or if stable disease was the best response. Trial results do not support such a strategy which was frequently not feasible and of limited benefit [563,564].
