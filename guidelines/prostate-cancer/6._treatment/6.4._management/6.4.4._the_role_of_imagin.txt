6.4.4. The role of imaging in PSA-only recurrence. Imaging is only of value if it leads to a treatment change which results in an improved outcome. In practice, however, there are very limited data available regarding the outcome’s consequent on imaging at recurrence. 6.4.4.1. Assessment of metastases (including nodal) 6.4.4.1.1. Bone scan and abdominopelvic CT Because BCR after RP or RT precedes clinical metastases by seven to eight years on average [825,904], the diagnostic yield of conventional imaging techniques (bone scan and abdominopelvic CT) is low in asymptomatic patients [905]. In men with PSA-only recurrence after RP the probability of a positive bone scan is < 5%, when the PSA level is < 7 ng/mL [906,907]. Only 11–14% of patients with BCR after RP have a positive CT [906]. In a series of 132 men with BCR after RP the mean PSA level and PSA velocity associated with a positive CT were 27.4 ng/mL and 1.8 ng/mL/month, respectively [908]. 6.4.4.1.2. Choline PET/CT In two different meta-analyses the combined sensitivities and specificities of choline PET/CT for all sites of recurrence in patients with BCR were 86–89% and 89–93%, respectively [909,910]. Choline PET/CT may detect multiple bone metastases in patients showing a single metastasis on bone scan [911] and may be positive for bone metastases in up to 15% of patients with BCR after RP and negative bone scan [912]. The specificity of choline PET/CT is also higher than bone scan, with fewer false positive and indeterminate findings [416]. Detection of LN metastases using choline PET/CT remains limited by the relatively poor sensitivity of the technique (see Section 5.3.2.3). Choline PET/CT sensitivity is strongly dependent on the PSA level and kinetics [424,913,914]. In patients with BCR after RP, PET/CT detection rates are only 5–24% when the PSA level is < 1 ng/mL but rise to 67–100% when the PSA level is > 5 ng/mL. Despite its limitations, choline PET/CT may change medical management in 18–48% of patients with BCR after primary treatment [915-917]. Choline PET/CT should only be recommended in patients fit enough for curative loco-regional salvage treatment. 6.4.4.1.3. Fluoride PET/CT 18F-NaF PET/CT has a higher sensitivity than bone scan in detecting bone metastases [918]. However, 18F -NaF PET/CT is limited by a relative lack of specificity and by the fact that it does not assess soft-tissue metastases [919]. 6.4.4.1.4. Fluciclovine PET/CT 18F-Fluciclovine PET/CT has been approved in the U.S. and Europe and it is therefore one of the PCa-specific radiotracers widely commercially available [919-922]. 18F-Fluciclovine PET/CT has a slightly higher sensitivity than choline PET/CT in detecting the site of relapse in BCR [923]. In a multi-centre trial evaluating 596 patients with BCR in a mixed population, fluciclovine PET/CT showed an overall detection rate of 67.7%; lesions could be visualised either at local level (38.7%) or in pelvic LNs (32.6%) [924]. As for choline PET/CT, fluciclovine PET/CT sensitivity is dependent on the PSA level, with a sensitivity likely inferior to 50% at PSA level < 1 ng/mL. In a prospective RCT evaluating the impact of 18F-fluciclovine PET/CT on SRT management decisions in patients with recurrence post-prostatectomy, in 28 of 79 (35.4%) patients overall radiotherapeutic management changed following 18F-fluciclovine PET/CT [925]. 18F-Fluciclovine PET/CT had a significantly higher positivity rate than conventional imaging (abdominopelvic CT or MRI plus bone scan) for whole body (79.7% vs. 13.9%, p < 0.001), prostate bed (69.6% vs. 5.1%, p < 0.001), and pelvic LNs (38.0% vs. 10.1%, p < 0.001) [925]. However, as yet, no data demonstrating that these changes translate into a survival benefit are available. 6.4.4.1.5. Prostate-specific membrane antigen based PET/CT PSMA PET/CT has shown good potential in patients with BCR, although most studies are limited by their retrospective design. Reported predictors of 68Ga-PSMA PET in the recurrence setting were updated based on a high-volume series (see Table 6.4.2) [867]. High sensitivity (75%) and specificity (99%) were observed on per-lesion analysis. Table 6.4.2: PSMA-positivity separated by PSA level category  PSA (ng/mL)68Ga-PMSA PET positivity< 0.233% (CI: 16–51)02–0.4945% (CI: 39–52)0.5–0.9959% (CI: 50–68)1.0–1.9975% (CI: 66–84)2.0+95% (CI: 92–97) PSA = prostate-specific antigen; 68Ga-PSMA PET = Gallium-68 prostate-specific membrane antigen positronemission tomography. PSMA PET/CT seems substantially more sensitive than choline PET/CT, especially for PSA levels < 1 ng/mL [926,927]. In a study of 314 patients with BCR after treatment and a median PSA level of 0.83 ng/mL, 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT was positive in 197 patients (67%) [928]. In another prospective multi-centre trial including 635 patients with BCR after RP (41%), RT (27%), or both (32%), PPV for 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT was 0.84 (95% CI: 0.75–0.90) by histopathologic validation (primary endpoint, n = 87) and 0.92 (95% CI: 0.75–0.90) by a composite reference standard. Detection rates significantly increased with PSA value [929]. A prospective multi-centre, multi-reader, open-label, phase II/III trial (OSPREY) evaluated the diagnostic performance of 18F-DCFPyL in patients with presumptive radiologic evidence of recurrent or metastatic PCa on conventional imaging [837]. Median sensitivity and median PPV were 95.8% (95% CI: 87.8%–99.0%) and 81.9% (95% CI: 73.7%–90.2%), respectively. Another prospective study evaluated the diagnostic performance of 18F-DCFPyL in 208 men with BCR after RP or RT. The primary endpoint, the correct localisation rate was achieved, demonstrating positive findings on 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT in the setting of negative standard conventional imaging [930]. At present there are no conclusive data about comparison of such tracers [931]. A prospective, open label, cross-over study, the PYTHON trial, has compared the per-patient detection rates (DR) of 18F-DCFPyL versus 18F-fluoromethylcholine PET/CT, in biochemical recurrence (BCR) setting. A total of 201 high-risk PCa patients with first BCR after radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy have completed the study. The per-patient DR was significantly higher for 18F-DCFPyL compared to 18F-fluoromethylcholine PET/CT (58% (117/201 patients) vs. 40% (81/201 patients), p < 0.0001). DR increased with higher PSA values for both tracers (PSA ≤ 0.5 ng/ml: 26/74 (35%) vs. 22/74 (30%); PSA 0.5 to ≤ 1.0 ng/ml: 17/31 (55%) vs. 10/31 (32%); PSA 1.01 to < 2.0 ng/ml: 13/19 (68%) vs. 6/19 (32%);PSA > 2.0: 50/57 (88%) vs. 39/57 (68%) for 18FDCFPyL- and 18F-fluoromethylcholine -PET/CT, respectively) [932]. Comparable results were found in a phase III trial of 18F-PSMA-1007 versus 18F-Fluorocholine PET/CT for the localisation of prostate cancer biochemical recurrence. In this prospective, randomised, crossover multi-centre study, the overall correct detection rates were significantly higher for 18F-PSMA-1007 than for 18F-fluorocholine when undetermined findings were considered positive for malignancy (0.82 vs. 0.65; p < 0.0001) [933]. 6.4.4.1.6. Whole-body and axial MRI Whole body MRI has not been widely evaluated in BCR because of its limited value in the detection of early metastatic involvement in normal-sized LNs [414,427,934]. In a prospective series of 68 patients with BCR, the diagnostic performance of DW-MRI was significantly lower than that of 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT and 18NaF PET/CT for diagnosing bone metastases [935]. 6.4.4.2. Assessment of local recurrences 6.4.4.2.1. Local recurrence after radical prostatectomy Because the sensitivity of anastomotic biopsies is low, especially for PSA levels < 1 ng/mL [905], SRT is usually decided on the basis of BCR without histological proof of local recurrence. The dose delivered to the prostatic fossa tends to be uniform since it has not been demonstrated that a focal dose escalation at the site of recurrence improves the outcome. Therefore, most patients undergo SRT without local imaging. Magnetic resonance imaging can detect local recurrences in the prostatic bed. The PSA threshold for MRI positivity seems between 0.3 and 0.5 ng/mL; PSA kinetics also influence the MRI positivity, even at low PSA values [936]. Two single-centre studies found that a negative MRI was an independent predictor of failure of SRT [937,938]. Conversely, a small (≤0.4 cc) relapse located at the vesico-urethral anastomosis is associated with excellent prognosis at salvage RT [939]. The Prostate Imaging for Recurrence Reporting (PI-RR) system has been recently launched to standardise MRI interpretation in the context of BCR after RP or RT [940]. Initial assessment suggests good reproducibility of the score [941]. Choline PET/CT is less sensitive for local relapse than MRI but detects more regional and distant metastases [942]. The detection rates of 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT in patients with BCR after RP increase with the PSA level [943]. PSMA PET/CT studies showed that a substantial part of recurrences after RP were located outside the prostatic fossa, even at low PSA levels [868,944]. Combining 68Ga-PSMA PET and MRI may improve the detection of local recurrences, as compared to 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT alone [945-947]. The EMPIRE-1, a single-centre, open-label, phase II/III RCT included 365 patients with detectable PSA after RP, but negative results on conventional imaging. They were randomised to RT directed by conventional imaging alone or to conventional imaging plus 18F-fluciclovine-PET/CT; patients with M1 disease in the PET/CT group (n = 4) were excluded Patients with cN1 were irradiated to the pelvic nodes, but without a boost to the metastases. After a median follow-up of 3.5 years, the PET/CT group was significantly associated with longer event-free survival (HR: 2.04, 95% CI: 1.06–3.93, p = 0.0327) [948]. 6.4.4.2.2. Local recurrence after radiation therapy In patients with BCR after RT, biopsy status is a major predictor of outcome, provided the biopsies are obtained 18–24 months after initial treatment. Given the morbidity of local salvage options it is necessary to obtain histological proof of the local recurrence before treating the patient [905]. MRI has yielded excellent results in identifying local recurrence and can be used for biopsy targeting and guiding local salvage treatment [905,949,950], even if it slightly underestimates the volume of the local recurrence [951]. Prostate-specific membrane antigen PET/CT can also detect local recurrences after RT [867] and concordance between PSMA PET/CT and MRI is highly suggestive of cancer recurrence [952]. 6.4.4.3. Summary of evidence of imaging in case of biochemical recurrence In patients with BCR imaging can detect both local recurrences and distant metastases, however, the sensitivity of detection depends on the PSA level. After RP, PSMA PET/CT is the imaging modality with the highest sensitivity at low PSA levels (< 0.5 ng/mL) and may help distinguishing patients with recurrences confined to the prostatic fossa from those with distant metastases which may impact the design and use of post-RP SRT. After RT, MRI has shown excellent results at detecting local recurrences and guiding prostate biopsy. Given the substantial morbidity of post-RT local salvage treatments, distant metastases must be ruled out in patients with local recurrences and who are fit for these salvage therapies. Choline-,fluciclovine- or PSMA-PET/CT can be used to detect metastases in these patients but for this indication PSMA PET/CT seems the most sensitive technique. 6.4.4.4.
