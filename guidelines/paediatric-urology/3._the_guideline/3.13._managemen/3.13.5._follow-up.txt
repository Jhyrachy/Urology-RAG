3.13.5. Follow-up. Neurogenic bladder patients require lifelong follow-up including not only urological aspects but also neurological and orthopaedic aspects. Regular investigation of upper and lower urinary tract is mandatory. In patients with changes of the function of the upper and/or lower urinary tract, a complete neurological re-investigation should be recommended including a total spine MRI to exclude a secondary tethered cord or worsening of the hydrocephalus. In addition, if some neurological changes are observed a complete investigation of the urinary tract should be undertaken. A recent study of this guideline panel revealed that the priorities of patients for future expectations were as following in decreasing order: GoL, surgical techniques, development of new medications and sexuality/fertility issues. Male spina bifida patients preferred new medications and sex/fertility issues more, whereas females favoured QoL issues improvement more. These factors should be considered during long-term management [2]. In those patients with urinary tract reconstruction using bowel segments, regular investigations concerning renal function, acid base balance and vitamin B12 status are mandatory to avoid metabolic complications. There is an increased risk for secondary malignancies in patients with a neurogenic bladder either with or without enteric bladder augmentations [881-885]. Therefore, patients need to be informed of this risk and possible signs like haematuria. Although there are insufficient data on follow-up schemes to discover secondary malignancies, after a reasonable follow-up time (e.g. ten to fifteen years), an annual cystoscopy can be considered.
