3.3.5.7. Prior to cardiovascular surgery. One systematic review and meta-analysis including three retrospective non-randomised studies involving a total of 1,116 patients was identified [113]. The procedures performed were non-valvular coronary artery bypass grafting (42%), valvular replacements (51%) and thoracic aortic surgeries (7%). Pre-operative treatment of ABU in 116 patients did not result in significant benefit regarding the rate of SSI compared to no treatment (12.9% vs. 8.2%, p=.0.086). A moderate heterogeneity was observed in the meta-analysis and pre-operative treatment of ABU had no significant effect on the rate of infectious complications (OR: 1.38, 95% CI 0.56 - 3.39). Due to the very low number, retrospective and non-randomised design of the included studies limited conclusions can be drawn from this. Further studies with appropriate design and sample size are needed to confirm these findings.
