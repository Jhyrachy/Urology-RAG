4.7. uric acid ammonium urate stones. uric acid ammonium urate stone formers considered high risk recurrence . uric acid nephrolithiasis responsible approximately 10% renal stones associated hyperuricosuria low urinary ph. hyperuricosuria may result dietary excess, endogenous overproduction (enzyme defects), myeloproliferative disorders, chemotherapy drugs, gout catabolism . low urinary ph may caused decreased urinary ammonium excretion (insulin resistance, gout, autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease [adpkd]), increased endogenous acid production (insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, exercise-induced lactic acidosis), increased acid intake (high animal protein intake), increased base loss (diarrhoea) . ammonium urate stones extremely rare, comprising < 1% types urinary stones. associated uti, malabsorption (inflammatory bowel disease ileostomy diversion laxative abuse), phosphate deficiency, hypokalemia, malnutrition. suggestions uric acid ammonium urate nephrolithiasis based level 3 4 evidence. chronic kidney disease frequently observed. 4.7.1. diagnosis figure 4.6 shows diagnostic algorithm uric acid stones figure 4.7 shows therapeutic algorithm uric acid ammonium urate stones. blood analysis requires measurement creatinine uric acid levels. urinalysis requires measurement urine volume, urine ph, specific weight urine, uric acid level. urine culture needed case ammonium urate stones. 4.7.2. interpretation results uric acid ammonium urate stones form completely different biochemical conditions. low urine ph promotes uric acid crystallisation. hyperuricosuria defined uric acid excretion > 4 mmol/day day > 5 mmol/day adult females males, respectively, > 0.12 mmol/kg/day children. hyperuricaemia may present, weak evidence association stone formation . hyperuricosuric calcium oxalate stone formation distinguished uric acid stone formation urinary ph, usually > 5.5 calcium oxalate stone formation < 5.5 uric acid stone formation occasional absence hyperuricosuria patients pure uric acid stones . ammonium urate crystals form urine ph > 6.5, high uric acid concentration urine ammonium present . 4.7.3. specific treatment general preventive measures recommended fluid intake diet. hyperuricosuric stone formers benefit purine reduction daily diet. figure 4.6 describes pharmacological treatment [23,648,650-660]. uric acid stones, allopurinol may change stone composition distribution patients gout pattern similar stone formers without gout . figure 4.6: diagnostic algorithm uric acid stonesadpkd = autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease; g6p = glucose-6 phosphate dehydrogenase; hgpt = hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase; prps = phosphoribosyl-pyrophosphate synthetase superactivity; xo = xanthine oxidase. figure 4.7: therapeutic algorithm uric acid- ammonium urate stones1 d: day.2 tid: three times day.3 higher ph may lead calcium phosphate stone formation.4 patients high uric acid excretion, allopurinol may helpful. 4.7.4. summary evidence recommendations management uric acid- ammonium urate stones summary evidencelealkaline citrates beneficial alkalinise urine uric acid stone formers.3allopurinol beneficial hyperuricosuric urate stone formers.1b recommendationsstrength ratingprescribe alkaline citrates alkalinise urine uric acid stone formers.strongprescribe allopurinol hyperuricosuric urate stone formers.strong
