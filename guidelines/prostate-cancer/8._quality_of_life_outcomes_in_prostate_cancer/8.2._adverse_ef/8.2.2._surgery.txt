8.2.2. Surgery. A lack of clear consensus in reporting surgical complications following RP, specifically urinary incontinence and stricture rates, and the introduction of different techniques has resulted in a wide variation in the types of complications reported, as well as variation in the overall incidence of complications [1351-1354]. The most common post-operative complication is ED but other related issues to consider include dry ejaculation, which occurs with removal of the prostate, change in the quality of orgasm and occasional pain on orgasm. Men also complain of loss of penile length (3.73%, 19/510 men) [1355]. The second most commonly occurring complication is long-term incontinence [1351-1354] but voiding difficulties may also occur associated with bladder neck contracture (e.g., 1.1% after RALP) [1356]. A key consideration is whether long-term consequences of surgery are reduced by using newer techniques such as RALP. Systematic reviews have documented complication rates after RALP [612-616], and can be compared with contemporaneous reports after RRP [617]. From these reports, the mean continence rates at twelve months were 89–100% for patients treated with RALP and 80–97% for patients treated with RRP. A prospective controlled non-randomised trial of patients undergoing RP in fourteen centres using RALP or RRP demonstrated that at twelve months after RALP, 21.3% were incontinent, as were 20.2% after RRP. The unadjusted OR was 1.08 (95% CI: 0.87–1.34). Erectile dysfunction was observed in 70.4% after RALP and 74.7% after RRP. The unadjusted OR was 0.81 (95% CI: 0.66–0.98) [618,1357]. Further follow-up demonstrates similar functional outcomes with both techniques at 24 months [1357,1358]. A single-centre randomised phase III study comparing RALP and RRP (n = 326) also demonstrates similar functional outcomes with both techniques at 24 months [1359]. Prostatectomy was found to increase the risk of complaints from an inguinal hernia, in particular after an open procedure when compared to minimally-invasive approaches [1360,1361]. For those undergoing minimally-invasive procedures port site hernia has been reported in 0.66% after inserting 12 mm bladeless trocar and can occur more rarely with 8 mm and 5 mm trocars [1362]. Another complication after primary treatment is lower limb and genital lymphedema. A SR found a prevalence of (0-14%) lower limb and (0-1%) genital lymphedema after radical prostatectomy with PLND [1363] and between 0-9% and 0-8% in patients after irradiation on the LNs. In the subgroup that underwent pelvic irradiation after staging pelvic LNs dissections the prevalence of lower limb (18-29%) and genital (2-22%) is substantially elevated.
