6.3.2.4. Management of recurrence after bulbar urethroplasty. Kahokehr et al., [334] followed nearly 400 patients after urethroplasty and found a recurrence rate of 6% (n=25). Ninety-two percent of the failed cases were treated successfully with DVIU and only 8% needed another open reconstruction. However, they did not mention characteristics of the recurrent cases nor the duration of follow-up. Rosenbaum et al., [352] and Javali et al., [353] retrospectively analysed the outcomes of BMG FGU for ReDo urethroplasty in 51 and 21 patients, respectively, using the other cheek as donor side. Patency rates were 82-86%, which is in the range of primary cases. Vetterlein et al., [354] compared primary (no previous open urethroplasty) vs. ReDo (previous open urethroplasty with BMG) vs. secondary (previous open urethroplasty without use of BMG) cases in a retrospective series of 534 patients with BMG FGU. The patency rates in primary and ReDo cases were comparable (87%) whilst the outcome in secondary cases was worse (71%). A small series (n=37) reported on the use of EPA for revision surgery after failed urethroplasty in strictures of 2.1 (range 1-3.5) cm length on average. Patency rates using EPA after failed primary EPA (51%) and after any other technique of urethroplasty (49%) were 95 and 94% respectively with a mean follow-up of 30 months [321]. Summary of evidenceLEBuccal mucosa free graft urethroplasty after failed urethroplasty achieves the same patency rates as primary cases.3 RecommendationStrength ratingUse oral mucosa free graft urethroplasty for ReDo urethroplasty in case the of a long stricture.Strong
