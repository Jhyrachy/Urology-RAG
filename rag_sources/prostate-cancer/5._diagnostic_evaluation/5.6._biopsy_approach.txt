p=0.2) overall infections (1.35% vs. 1.22%; p=0.8) thus, growing body evidence suggest antibiotic prophylaxis may required transperineal biopsy; however, panel chosen wait number ongoing rcts report study findings making recommendation this. 5.6.3. transrectal prostate biopsy updated meta-analysis eleven rcts including 2,237 men showed use rectal povidone-iodine preparation biopsy, addition antimicrobial prophylaxis, resulted significantly lower rate infectious complications (rr: 95% ci: 0.47 [0.36–0.61]) . single rcts showed evidence benefit perineal skin disinfection , reported advantage rectal povidone-iodine preparation biopsy compared biopsy . meta-analysis four rcts including 671 men evaluated use rectal preparation enema transrectal biopsy. significant advantage found regarding infectious complications (rr: 95% ci: 0.96 [0.64–1.54]) . updated meta-analysis 28 rcts 4,027 patients found evidence use periprostatic injection local anaesthesia resulted infectious complications injection (rr: 95% ci: 1.08 [0.79–1.48]) . meta-analysis nine rcts including 2,230 patients found extended biopsy templates showed comparable infectious complications standard templates (rr: 95% ci: 0.80 [0.53–1.22]) . additional meta-analyses found difference infectious complications regarding needle guide type (disposable vs. reusable), needle type (coaxial vs. non-coaxial), needle size (large vs. small), number injections peri-prostatic nerve block (standard vs. extended) . meta-analysis eleven studies 1,753 patients showed significantly reduced infections transrectal prostate biopsy using antimicrobial prophylaxis compared placebo/control (rr: 95% ci: 0.56 [0.40–0.77]) . fluoroquinolones traditionally used antibiotic prophylaxis setting; however, recent years increase fluoroquinolone resistance. addition, european commission implemented stringent regulatory conditions regarding use fluoroquinolones resulting suspension indication peri-operative antibiotic prophylaxis including prostate biopsy . sr meta-analysis antibiotic prophylaxis prevention infectious complications following prostate biopsy concluded countries fluoroquinolones allowed antibiotic prophylaxis, minimum full one-day administration, well targeted therapy case fluoroquinolone resistance, augmented prophylaxis (combination two different classes antibiotics) recommended . countries use fluoroquinolones suspended, cephalosporins aminoglycosides used individual agents comparable infectious complications based meta-analysis two rcts . meta-analysis three rcts reported fosfomycin trometamol superior fluoroquinolones (rr: 95% ci: 0.49 [0.27–0.87]) , routine general use critically assessed due relevant infectious complications reported non-randomised studies . note indication fosfomycin trometamol prostate biopsy withdrawn germany manufacturers submit necessary pharmacokinetic data support indication. urologists advised check local guidance relation use fosfomycin trometamol prostate biopsy. another possibility use augmented prophylaxis without fluoroquinolones, although standard combination established date. finally, targeted prophylaxis based rectal swap/stool culture plausible, rcts available non-fluoroquinolones. see figure 5.1 prostate biopsy workflow reduce infections complications. 5.6.4. summary evidence recommendations performing prostate biopsy (in line eau urological infections guidelines panel) summary evidencelea meta-analysis eight studies including 1,596 patients showed significantly reduced infectious complications patients undergoing transperineal biopsy compared transrectal biopsy.1aa meta-analysis eight non-rcts reported comparable rates post-biopsy infections patients undergoing transperineal biopsy irrespective antibiotic prophylaxis given not.1aa meta-analysis eleven rcts including 2,036 men showed use rectal povidone-iodine preparation transrectal biopsy, addition antimicrobial prophylaxis, resulted significantly lower rate infectious complications.1aa meta-analysis eleven studies 1,753 patients showed significantly reduced infections transrectal biopsy using antimicrobial prophylaxis compared placebo/control.1a recommendationsstrength rating*perform prostate biopsy using transperineal approach due lower risk infectious complications.stronguse routine surgical disinfection perineal skin transperineal biopsy.stronguse rectal cleansing povidone-iodine prior transrectal prostate biopsy.stronguse either target prophylaxis based rectal swab stool culture;
