3.1. Epidemiology. Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in men, with an estimated 1.4 million diagnoses and 375,000 deaths worldwide in 2020 [5,6]. In Europe, it is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in men and the third cancer-related cause of death in men [7]. A SR of autopsy studies reported a prevalence of PCa at age < 30 years of 5% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3–8%), increasing by an odds ratio (OR) of 1.7 (1.6–1.8) per decade, to a prevalence of 59% (48–71%) by age > 79 years [8]. There is variation in the frequency of autopsy-detected PCa between men with different ethnical backgrounds and geographical areas (e.g., 83% in white US males vs. 41% in Japan at age 71–80) [9]. Regarding incidence of PCa diagnosis, the variation is even more pronounced between different geographical areas, driven by rate of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing and influenced by (inter)national organisations recommendations on screening (see Section 5.1) [10]. It is highest in Australia/New Zealand and Northern America (age-standardised rates [ASR] per 100,000 of 111.6 and 97.2, respectively), and in Western and Northern Europe (ASRs of 94.9 and 85, respectively). The incidence is low in Eastern and South-Central Asia (ASRs of 10.5 and 4.5, respectively), but rising [11]. Rates in Eastern and Southern Europe were low but have also shown a steady increase [6,9]. Besides PSA testing, incidence is also dependent on the age of the population, geography and ethnicity. There is relatively less variation in mortality rates worldwide, although rates are generally high in populations of African descent (e.g., Caribbean: ASR of 29 and Sub-Saharan Africa: ASRs ranging between nineteen and fourteen), intermediate in the USA and very low in Asia (South-Central Asia: ASR of 2.9) [6,12]. Mortality due to PCa has decreased in most Western nations but the magnitude of the reduction varies between countries [5].
