10.1.3.2. Surgical management- second-line treatments. Second-line intervention typically refers to surgical intervention in the form of penile shunt surgery and penile implant insertion for refractory or delayed ischaemic priapism, and should only be considered when other medical management options have failed. There is no evidence detailing the time frames before moving on to surgery after first-line treatment, although a period of at least 1 hour of first-line treatment without detumescence can be considered prior to moving to surgical intervention. A number of clinical indicators suggest failure of first-line treatment including continuing corporal rigidity, cavernosal acidosis, anoxia, severe glucopenia, absence of cavernosal artery inflow by penile colour duplex US, and elevated intracorporal pressure [1402]. 10.1.3.2.1. Penile shunt surgery Penile shunt surgery aims to produce an outflow for ischaemic blood from the corpus cavernosum into the corpus spongiosal tissues, thereby allowing restoration of normal circulation within these structures. Accordingly, a shunt creates an opening in the tunica albuginea, with either the glans, corpus spongiosum, or a vein for blood drainage (Table 50) [1336,1369,1403]. The type of shunt procedure is chosen according to the surgeon’s preference and familiarity with the procedure. It is conventional practice for distal shunt procedures to be tried before considering proximal shunting. It is important to assess the success of surgery by direct observation of penile rigidity or by repeated testing (e.g., cavernous blood gas testing) [1336,1369,1404,1405]. The use of penile colour US may not give appropriate information because of the hyperaemic (reperfusion) period that follows decompression after the ischaemic state [1406]. The recovery rates of erectile function in men undergoing shunt surgery following prolonged episodes of priapism are low and are directly related to the duration of priapism, pre-operative erectile status and age [1404,1405,1407]. If ischaemic priapism resolves within 24 hours of onset, it has been reported that 78-100% of patients regain spontaneous functional erections (with or without PDE5Is use). In contrast, other studies have shown that priapism for more than 36-48 hours appears to result in both structural and functional effects on corporal smooth muscle, with poorer outcomes (ED > 90%) [1404]. In general, shunt procedures undertaken after this period (36-48 hours) may only serve to limit pain without any beneficial effects on erectile function and early penile prosthesis insertion can be considered [1342,1409]. Procedures for shunting require incision through the tunica albuginea and expose collagen to coagulation factors in the penile blood and thus activate the blood-clotting cascade. Peri-operative anti-coagulation is advocated to facilitate resolution of the priapism. There was an 84% decrease in priapism recurrence in the shunt group that received peri-procedural anti-thrombotic treatment (325 mg acetylsalicylic acid pre-operatively, and 5000 IU intraoperative heparin, 81 mg acetylsalicylic acid and 75 mg clopidogrel post-operatively for 5 days) compared with the group that did not receive peri-procedural anti-thrombotic treatment after failed aspiration [1410]. Four categories of shunt procedures have been reported [1336,1370,1403,1409]. The limited data available does not allow one procedure to be recommended over another. However, distal shunts are less invasive and associated with lower rates of post-operative ED and therefore are recommended as the first surgical intervention of choice (Appendix 6 Table 10.1). Percutaneous distal (corpora-glanular) shunts Winter’s procedure uses a Trucut biopsy needle to create a fistula between the glans penis and each corpus cavernosum [1336,1348,1370,1406,1411]. Post-operative sequelae are uncommon [1412]. Winter’s shunt is easy to perform, but has been reported as the least successful operation to create a distal shunt [1405]. This is because the diameter of the Trucut needle is only 1.6 mm (14-18 g) and therefore cannot accommodate the increased blood flow from post-ischaemic hyperaemia, resulting in poor drainage, increased intracavernous pressure and consequent premature closure of the shunt [1406]. Ebbehoj’s technique involves making multiple tunical incision windows between the glans and each tip of the corpus cavernosum by means of a size 11 blade scalpel passed several times percutaneously [1336,1370,1406,1413,1414]. T-Shunt involves performing a bilateral procedure using a scalpel with a size 10 blade inserted through the glans just lateral to the urethral meatus until it enters the tip of the corpus cavernosum. The blade is then rotated 90° away (to the lateral side) from the urethral meatus and withdrawn [1336,1370,1406,1415] (LE: 3). If unsuccessful, the procedure is repeated on the opposite side. The T-shunt can be followed by a tunnelling procedure using a size 8/10 Hegar dilator inserted through the glans and into the corpus cavernosum, which can also be performed using US guidance, mainly to avoid urethral injury [1415]. The entry sites in the glans are sutured following detumescence. Tunnelling with a 7 mm metal sound or 7/8 Hegar dilator is necessary in patients with priapism duration > 48 hours. Tunnelling is a potentially attractive procedure as it combines the features of distal and proximal shunts with proximal drainage of the corpus cavernosum and may ameliorate the profibrotic effect of sludged blood retained in the corpus cavernosum [1407,1409,1415]. Open distal (corpora-glanular) shunts Al-Ghorab’s procedure consists of an open bilateral excision of circular cone segments of the distal tunica albuginea via the glans penis, along with subsequent glans closure by running suture with absorbable material. A transverse incision on the glans may compromise arterial blood flow because distal deep dorsal arteries run longitudinally in the glans [1336,1370,1406,1416-1418]. Burnett’s technique (Snake manoeuvre) is a modification of the Al-Ghorab corpora-glanular shunt. It involves retrograde insertion of a 7/8 Hegar dilator into the distal end of each corpus cavernosum through the original Al-Ghorab glandular excision. After removal of the dilator from the corpus cavernosum, blood evacuation is facilitated by manual compression of the penis sequentially from a proximal to distal direction. After detumescence, the glans penis is closed as in the Al-Ghorab procedure [1336,1370,1406,1419,1420]. Reported complications include wound infection, penile skin necrosis and urethrocutaneous fistulae [1420]. Open proximal (corpora-spongiosal) shunts Quackles’s technique uses a trans-scrotal or perineal approach; a proximal open shunt technique creates a communication between the corpus cavernosum and the corpus spongiosum. The most frequent complications include an unwanted urethro-cavernous fistula and urethral stricture or cavernositis [1336,1370,1403,1421]. The risk of urethral injury is less with a perineal approach to the bulb of the corpus spongiosum. Proximal shunts are more invasive and ED rates are documented to be higher [1402]. Peno-scrotal decompression More recently a proximal decompression technique with the aim to spare the glans with high success rates has been described. The technique is based upon opening of the proximal corpus cavernosum combined with proximal and distal tunnelling using a suction tip [1422]. In a cohort of 25 patients, 12 had undergone previous corpora-glanular shunt surgery. Recurrence was observed in two of 25 patients with unilateral peno-scrotal decompression. In the 15 patients who had follow-up data, 40% had ED. Whilst, representing a promising technique, PSD in cases of refractory priapism may further delay penile prosthesis insertion with detrimental effects on surgical outcomes including penile shortening and prosthetic infection. Vein anastomoses/shunts Grayhack’s procedure mobilises the saphenous vein below the junction of the femoral vein and anastomoses the vein end-to-side onto the corpus cavernosum. Venous shunts may be complicated by saphenofemoral thrombus formation and by pulmonary embolism [1336,1370,1423-1425]. 10.1.3.2.2. Immediate penile prosthesis implantation The studies pertaining to penile implantation surgery are principally retrospective non-randomised case series (Appendix 9 online supplementary evidence). All of the studies described priapism resolution rate, sexual function and surgical adverse events although the follow-up period was variable [1333]. Refractory, therapy-resistant, acute ischaemic priapism or episodes lasting more than 48 hours usually result in complete ED, and possibly significant penile deformity in the long-term. In these cases, immediate penile prosthesis implantation surgery is advocated [1426,1427,1429]. Gadolinium-enhanced penile MRI [1366] and cavernosal smooth muscle biopsy have been used to diagnose smooth muscle necrosis (which, if present, would suggest that shunting is likely to fail) and may help in decision-making and patient counselling in cases of refractory or delayed presentation (> 48 hours) that may be considered for immediate penile prosthesis insertion. Early implantation of a penile prosthesis is associated with lower infection rates (6-7% vs. 19-30%), penile shortening (3% vs. 40%) and revision rates (9% vs. 27%) compared to late insertion. General satisfaction rate for early implantation is higher (96%) than for late implantation (60%) [1342] (Appendix 10 online supplementary evidence). Potential complications that could compromise immediate penile prosthesis implantation include distal erosion and infection [1426,1428], along with a small rate of revision surgery [1426]. Early surgery also offers the opportunity to maintain penile length and girth and prevent penile curvature due to cavernosal fibrosis. The prosthesis can be exchanged for an inflatable prosthesis at a later date, which may allow upsizing of the implant cylinders [1430]. The decision on which type of implant to insert is dependent on patient suitability, surgeons’ experience, and availability and cost of the equipment. The immediate insertion of a malleable penile prosthesis is recommended to avoid the difficulty and complications of delayed prosthetic surgery in the presence of corporal fibrosis. There are no randomised trials comparing the efficacy and complication rates of malleable and inflatable penile prostheses. Despite the higher infection rate in priapism patients compared to those with virgin prosthesis, in patients who are well-motivated and counselled prior to the procedure, immediate inflatable penile prosthesis implantation may be undertaken, although in most cases a semi-rigid implant is more suitable as it is easier to implant and reduces operative time and hence the risk of prosthetic infection. A further issue with immediate insertion of an inflatable penile prosthesis is that the patient must begin cycling the device immediately to avoid a fibrous capsule forming and contracting. Early cycling of an inflatable penile prosthesis prevents penile curvature and shortening [1342]. Currently, there are no clear indications for immediately implanting a penile prosthesis in men with acute ischaemic priapism, although this can be considered in men with delayed or refractory priapism [1369]. Relative indications include [1336]: Ischaemia that has been present for more than 48 hours.Failure of aspiration and sympathomimetic intracavernous injections in delayed priapism (> 48 hours).Magnetic resonance imaging or corporal biopsy evidence of corporal smooth muscle necrosis [1336,1426].Failure of a shunting procedure; although, in delayed cases (> 48 hours), implantation might be considered ahead of shunt surgery.Refractory priapism in patients who have undergone shunting procedures. The optimal time for implantation is within the first three weeks from the priapism episode [1342,1402,1431]. If shunt surgery has been performed, penile prosthesis implantation can be further delayed in order to allow reduction of oedema, wound healing and risk of prosthetic infection. A vacuum device to avoid fibrosis and penile shortening may be used during this waiting period [1432]. 10.1.3.2.3. Surgery for non-acute sequelae after ischaemic priapism Structural changes may occur after ischaemic priapism including cavernosal tissue necrosis and fibrosis with consequent penile scarring, megalophallic deformities, penile shortening, and occasional penile loss [1403,1426,1433,1434]. Erectile dysfunction is also often observed [1336,1435]. Unfortunately, these outcomes can still occur despite apparently successful first or second-line treatment in detumescence of the penis. Penile prosthesis implantation is occasionally indicated in SCD patients with severe ED because other therapeutic options, such as PDE5Is and intracavernous injections are avoided as they may provoke a further priapism event [1336,1369]. In severe corporal fibrosis, narrow-based prosthetic devices are preferable because they are easier to insert and need less dilatation [1426]. After severe priapism that has resulted in penile destruction with complicated deformities or even loss of penile tissue, it may be necessary to make changes to the surgical technique. Multiple corporotomies, corporal excavation, optical corporotomy-Shaeer technique, dilatation with Carrion-Rosello cavernotome, Uramix or Mooreville cavernotome, excision of scar tissue, and use of small-diameter prosthesis, or penile reconstruction using grafts can be utilised, if concomitant prosthesis implantation is considered [1408,1436]. Figure 13: Management work-up of ischaemic priapism  (*) Dose of phenylephrine should be reduced in children. It can result in significant hypertension and shouldbe used with caution in men with cardiovascular disease. Monitoring of pulse and blood pressure is advisable in all patients during administration and for one hour afterwards. Its use is contraindicated in men with a history of cerebro-vascular disease and significant hypertension.
