3.2. Aetiology. Established risk factors include lifestyle factors such as smoking (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.23â€“1.58), obesity BMI (> 35 vs. < 25), (HR: 1.71 [1.06-2.79]), hypertension (HR: 1.70 [1.30-2.22]) and metabolic syndrome (RR 1.62 [1.41-1.87]) [4-10]. 50.2% of patients with RCC are current or former smokers. By histology, the proportions of current or former smokers range from 38% in patients with chromophobe carcinoma (chRCC) to 61.9% in those with collecting duct/medullary carcinoma [11]. In a SR, diabetes was also found to be detrimental [12]. Having a first-degree relative with kidney cancer is also associated with an increased risk of RCC [13]. Moderate alcohol consumption appears to have a protective effect for reasons as yet unknown, while any physical activity level also seems to have some protective effect [4,5,12,14,15]. A number of other factors have been suggested to be associated with higher or lower risk of RCC, including specific dietary habits and occupational exposure to specific carcinogens, but no high-quality evidence level exists [6,16]. The most effective prophylaxis is to avoid cigarette smoking and reduce obesity [4-7]. Genetic risk factors are known to play a role in the development of RCC (see Section 3.5.6 - Hereditary kidney tumours).
