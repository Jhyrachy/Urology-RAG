4.1.5. follow-up. risk complications relates aetiology, injury grade, mode management . follow-up includes physical examination, urinalysis, diagnostic imaging, blood pressure measurement serum creatinine . potential complications primarily identified imaging; however, follow-up imaging recommended low-grade uncomplicated injury. ultrasound used define post-injury anatomy avoiding ionising radiation. nuclear scans useful documenting functional recovery following renal injury reconstruction . annual blood pressure monitoring recommended exclude renovascular hypertension . 4.1.5.1. complications early (< 1 month) complications include bleeding, infection, perinephric abscess, sepsis, urinary fistula, hypertension, urinary extravasation, urinoma. delayed complications include bleeding, calculus formation, chronic pyelonephritis, hypertension, avf, hydronephrosis pseudo-aneurysms. bleeding may life-threatening elective angiographic embolisation preferred treatment . perinephric abscess formation initially managed percutaneous drainage . hypertension rare . may occur acutely external compression peri-renal haematoma (page kidney), chronically due compressive scar formation, result renal artery thrombosis, segmental arterial thrombosis, renal artery stenosis (goldblatt kidney), avf. arteriography may required. treatment, including medical management, excision ischaemic parenchymal segment, vascular reconstruction, nephrectomy, indicated hypertension persists . arteriovenous fistulae usually present delayed onset significant haematuria, often penetrating trauma. percutaneous embolisation often effective symptomatic avf, larger fistulae may require surgery . development pseudo-aneurysm rare complication following blunt trauma.
