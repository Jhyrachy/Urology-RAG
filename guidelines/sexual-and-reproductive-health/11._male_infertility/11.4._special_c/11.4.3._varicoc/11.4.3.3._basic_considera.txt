11.4.3.3. Basic considerations. 11.4.3.3.1. Varicocele and fertility Varicocele is present in almost 15% of the normal male population, in 25% of men with abnormal semen analysis and in 35-40% of men presenting with infertility [1522,1721-1723]. The incidence of varicocele among men with primary infertility is estimated at 35–44%, whereas the incidence in men with secondary infertility is 45–81% [1522,1722,1723]. Worsening semen parameters are associated with a higher grade of varicocele and age [1722,1724]. The exact association between reduced male fertility and varicocele is unknown. Increased scrotal temperature, hypoxia and reflux of toxic metabolites can cause testicular dysfunction and infertility due to increased overall survival and DNA damage [1723]. The exact association between reduced male fertility and varicocele is unknown. Increased scrotal temperature, hypoxia and reflux of toxic metabolites can cause testicular dysfunction and infertility due to increased [1721,1723]. 11.4.3.3.2. Varicocelectomy Varicocele repair has been a subject of debate for several decades. A meta-analysis of RCTs and observational studies in men with only clinical varicoceles has shown that surgical varicocelectomy significantly improves semen parameters in men with abnormal semen parameters, including men with NOA with hypo-spermatogenesis or late maturation (spermatid) arrest on testicular pathology [1721,1725-1728]. A meta-analysis showed that improvements in semen parameters are usually observed after surgical correction in men with abnormal semen parameters [1729]. Varicocelectomy can also reverse sperm DNA damage and improve OS levels [1721,1723]. Pain resolution after varicocelectomy occurs in 48-90% of patients [1730]. A systematic review has shown greater improvement in higher-grade varicoceles and this should be taken into account during patient counselling [1731]. In RCTs, varicocele repair in men with a subclinical varicocele was ineffective at increasing the chances of spontaneous pregnancy [1732]. Also, in randomised studies that included mainly men with normal semen parameters no benefit was found to favour treatment over observation. This was also reported in a systematic review and meta-analysis including prospective randomised and non-randomised studies [1733]. In studies including patients with abnormal semen parameters pregnancy rates (OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.00–1.65, p = 0.04) and total sperm count (mean difference: 12.34 million/ml, 95% CI 3.49–21.18, p = 0.006) were significantly improved by varicocele treatment compared with observation. A benefit for varicocele treatment was not found for sperm progressive motility and normal sperm morphology [1733]. When pre- versus post-treatment values were considered in the varicocele treatment arm only a benefit in terms of sperm count, progressive motility, and normal morphology was found [1733]. Another systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the change in conventional semen parameters after varicocele repair (n=1,426) compared to untreated controls (n=996) [1734]. Significantly improved post-operative semen parameters where reported in treated patients compared to controls with regards to sperm concentration (SMD 1.73; 95% CI 1.12 to 2.34; p<0.001), total sperm count (SMD 1.89; 95% CI 0.56 to 3.22; p < 0.05), progressive sperm motility (SMD 3.30; 95% CI 2.16 to 4.43; p < 0.01), total sperm motility (SMD 0.88; 95% CI 0.03 to 1.73; p=0.04) and normal sperm morphology (SMD 1.67; 95% CI 0.87 to 2.47; p < 0.05) [1734]. A Cochrane review from 2012 concluded that there is evidence to suggest that treatment of a varicocele in men from couples with otherwise unexplained subfertility may improve a couple’s chance of spontaneous pregnancy [1735]. Similarly, a Cochrane review from 2021 including 5,384 participants showed that varicocele treatment may improve pregnancy rates compared to delayed or no treatment (RR 1.55, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.26) [1736]. Two meta-analyses of RCTs comparing treatment to observation in men with a clinical varicocele, oligozoospermia and otherwise unexplained infertility, favoured treatment, with a combined OR of 2.39-4.15 (95% CI: 1.56-3.66) and (95% CI: 2.31-7.45), respectively [1728,1735]. Average time to improvement in semen parameters is up to two spermatogenic cycles [1737,1738] with spontaneous pregnancy occurring between six and twelve months after varicocelectomy [1739,1740]. A further meta-analysis has reported that varicocelectomy may improve outcomes following ART in oligozoospermic men with an OR of 1.69 (95% CI: 0.95-3.02) [1741]. 11.4.3.3.3. Prophylactic varicocelectomy In adolescents with a varicocele, there is a significant risk of over-treatment because most adolescents with a varicocele have no problem achieving pregnancy later in life [1742]. Prophylactic treatment is only advised in case of documented testicular growth deterioration confirmed by serial clinical or Doppler US examinations and/or abnormal semen analysis [1743,1744]. Varicocelectomy and NOA Several non-randomised studies have suggested that varicocelectomy may lead to sperm appearing in the ejaculate in men with azoospermia. In one such study, microsurgical varicocelectomy in men with NOA led to sperm in the ejaculate post-operatively with an increase in ensuing natural or assisted pregnancies [1745]. Meta-analyses have further corroborated these findings; 468 patients diagnosed with NOA and varicocele underwent surgical varicocele repair or percutaneous embolisation. In patients who underwent varicocelectomy, SRRs increased compared to those without varicocele repair (OR: 2.65; 95% CI: 1.69-4.14; p < 0.001). In 43.9% of the patients (range: 20.8%-55.0%), sperm were found in post-operative ejaculate. These findings indicate that varicocelectomy in patients with NOA and clinical varicocele is associated with improved SRR, that sperm retrieval may be avoided when sperm reappear in the ejaculate following varicocelectomy. 1397256787However, the quality of evidence available is low and the risks and benefits of varicocele repair must be discussed fully with the patient with NOA and a clinically significant varicocele prior to embarking upon treatment intervention [1726]. The current understanding of the underlying genetic defects of NOA must be taken into account when interpreting contemporary literature. Varicocelectomy and hypogonadism Evidence also suggests that men with clinical varicoceles who are hypogonadal may benefit from varicocele intervention. One meta-analysis studied the efficacy of varicocele intervention by comparing the pre-operative and post-operative serum testosterone of 712 men. The combined analysis of seven studies demonstrated that the mean post-operative serum testosterone improved by 34.3 ng/dL (95% CI: 22.57-46.04, p < 0.00001, I² = 0%) compared with their pre-operative levels. An analysis of surgery vs. untreated control results showed that mean testosterone among hypoganadal patients increased by 105.65 ng/dL (95% CI: 77.99-133.32 ng/dL), favouring varicocelectomy [1746]. However, results must be treated with caution and adequate cost-benefit analysis must be undertaken to determine the risks and benefits of surgical intervention over testosterone therapy in this setting. Although, varicocelectomy may be offered to hypogonadal men with clinically significant varicoceles, patients must be advised that the full benefits of treatment in this setting must be further evaluated with prospective RCTs. 11.4.3.3.4. Varicocelectomy for assisted reproductive technology and raised SDF Varicocelectomy can improve sperm DNA integrity [1742,1747]. A systematic review and meta-analysis analysed data from 1,070 infertile men with clinical varicocele and showed that varicocelectomy was associated with reduced post-operative SDF rates (weighted mean difference 7.23%; 95% CI: 8.86 to 5.59) [1748]. Improvement of DNA integrity was independent from the assay used (SCSA vs. TUNEL vs. SCD) and the surgical technique performed. The estimated weighted mean difference was greater in studies with pre-operative mean fragmentation index ≥ 20% than that in studies with SDF < 20%, suggesting that varicocelectomy might be more beneficial in men with elevated baseline SDF values [1748]. The magnitude of the effect size increased as a function of preoperative SDF levels (coefficient: 0.23; 95%CI: 0.07 to 0.39). There is now increasing evidence that varicocele treatment may improve DNA fragmentation and outcomes from ART [1741,1742]. As a consequence, more recently it has been suggested that the indications for varicocele intervention should be expanded to include men with raised DNA fragmentation. If a patient has failed ART (e.g., failure of implantation, embryogenesis or recurrent pregnancy loss) there is an argument that if DNA damage is raised, consideration could be given to varicocele intervention after extensive counselling [1749], and exclusion of other causes of raised SDF [1742,1750].The dilemma remains as to whether varicocele treatment is indicated in men with raised SDF and normal semen parameters. This decision would need a full and open discussion with the infertile couple, taking into consideration the female partners ovarian reserve and the surgical risks and potential delays in ART associated with varicocele intervention. In a meta-analysis of non-azoospermic infertile men with clinical varicocele by Estevez et al., four retrospective studies were included of men undergoing ICSI, and included 870 cycles (438 subjected to ICSI with prior varicocelectomy, and 432 without prior varicocelectomy). There was a significant increase in the clinical pregnancy rates (OR 1.59, 95% CI: 1.19-2.12, I2 = 25%) and live birth rates (OR 2.17, 95% CI: 1.55-3.06, I2 = 0%) in the varicocelectomy group compared to the group subjected to ICSI without previous varicocelectomy [1726]. A further study evaluated the effects of varicocele repair and its impact on pregnancy and live birth rates in infertile couples undergoing ART in male partners with oligo-azoospermia or azoospermia and a varicocele [1741]. In 1,241 patients, a meta-analysis demonstrated that varicocelectomy improved live birth rates for the oligospermic (OR = 1.699) men and combined oligo-azoospermic/azoospermic groups (OR = 1.761). Pregnancy rates were higher in the azoospermic group (OR = 2.336) and combined oligo-azoospermic/azoospermic groups (OR 1.760). Live birth rates were higher for patients undergoing IUI after intervention (OR 8.360).
