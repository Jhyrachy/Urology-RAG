5.2.2.5 α-reductase inhibitors. Mechanism of action: Androgen effects on the prostate are mediated by dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which is converted from testosterone by the enzyme 5α-reductase [178], which has two isoforms: 5α-reductase type 1: predominant expression and activity in the skin and liver.5α-reductase type 2: predominant expression and activity in the prostate. Two 5-ARIs are available for clinical use: dutasteride and finasteride. Finasteride inhibits only 5α-reductase type 2, whereas dutasteride inhibits both 5α-reductase types (dual 5-ARI). The 5-ARIs induce apoptosis of prostate epithelial cells [179] leading to prostate size reduction of about 18-28% and a decrease in circulating PSA levels of about 50% after six to twelve months of treatment [180]. Mean prostate volume and PSA reduction may be even more pronounced after long-term treatment. Continuous treatment reduces the serum DHT concentration by approximately 70% with finasteride and 95% with dutasteride. However, prostate DHT concentration is reduced to a similar level (85-90%) by both 5-ARIs. Efficacy: Clinical effects relative to placebo are seen after treatment of at least six months. After two to four years of treatment 5-ARIs improve IPSS by approximately 15-30%, decrease prostate volume by 18-28%, and increase Qmax by 1.5-2.0 mL/s in patients with LUTS due to prostate enlargement [65,163,164,181-187]. An indirect comparison and one direct comparative trial (twelve months duration) indicated that dutasteride and finasteride are equally effective in the treatment of LUTS [180,188]. Symptom reduction depends on initial prostate size. Finasteride may not be more efficacious than placebo in patients with prostates < 40 mL [189]. However, dutasteride seems to reduce IPSS, prostate volume, and the risk of AUR, and to increase Qmax even in patients with prostate volumes of between 30 and 40 mL [190,191]. A long-term trial with dutasteride in symptomatic men with prostate volumes > 30 mL and increased risk for disease progression showed that dutasteride reduced LUTS at least as much as the α1-blocker tamsulosin [163,187,192]. The greater the baseline prostate volume (or serum PSA level), the faster and more pronounced the symptomatic benefit of dutasteride as compared to tamsulosin. 5α-reductase inhibitors, but not α1-blockers, reduce the long-term (> 1 year) risk of AUR or need for surgery [65,185,193]. In the PLESS study, finasteride reduced the relative risk of AUR by 57% and need for surgery by 55% (absolute risk reduction 4% and 7%, respectively) at four years, compared with placebo [185]. In the MTOPS study, finasteride reduced the relative risk of AUR by 68% and need for surgery by 64% (absolute risk reduction 2% and 3%, respectively), also at four years [65]. A pooled analysis of three RCTs with two-year follow-up data, reported that treatment with finasteride decreased the relative risk of AUR by 57%, and surgical intervention by 34% (absolute risk reduction 2% for both) in patients with moderately symptomatic LUTS [194]. Dutasteride has also demonstrated efficacy in reducing the risks for AUR and BPO-related surgery. Open-label trials have demonstrated relevant changes in urodynamic parameters [195,196]. Furthermore, finasteride might reduce blood loss during transurethral prostate surgery, probably due to its effects on prostatic vascularisation, although evidence for a clinically significant effect is mixed [197-199]. Tolerability and safety: The most common adverse events are reduced libido, erectile dysfunction (ED) and less frequently, ejaculation disorders such as retrograde ejaculation, ejaculation failure, or decreased semen volume [65,164,180,200]. Gynaecomastia (with breast or nipple tenderness) develops in 1-2% of patients. Two studies have suggested that treatment with 5-ARIs is associated with a higher incidence of high-grade cancers although no causal relationship has been proven [201,202]. There is a long-standing debate regarding potential cardiovascular side effects of 5-ARIs, in particular dutasteride [203]. Population-based studies in Taiwan and Ontario did not find an association between the use of 5-ARIs and increased cardiovascular side effects [203,204]. In a British-Taiwanese population-based cohort study, the risk of type II diabetes was higher in men with 5-ARIs than in men receiving tamsulosin but did not differ between dutasteride and finasteride [205]. A large Swedish cohort study showed an increased risk of depression with both finasteride (HR 1.61) and dutasteride (HR 1.68), but no long-term association with dementia or suicide risk [206]. Practical considerations: Treatment with 5-ARIs should be considered in men with moderate-to-severe LUTS and an enlarged prostate (> 40 mL) and/or elevated PSA concentration (> 1.4-1.6 ng/mL). They can prevent the risk of AUR and need for surgery. Due to the slow onset of action, they are not suitable for short-term use. Their effect on PSA needs to be considered in relation to PCa screening. Summary of evidenceLEAfter two to four years of treatment, 5-ARIs improve IPSS by approximately 15-30%, decrease prostate volume by 18-28%, and increase Qmax by 1.5-2.0 mL/s in patients with LUTS due to prostate enlargement.1b5α-reductase inhibitors can prevent disease progression with regard to AUR and the need for surgery. Due to 5-ARIs slow onset of action, they are suitable only for long-term treatment (years).1aThe most relevant adverse effects of 5-ARIs are related to sexual function, and include reduced libido, ED and less frequently, ejaculation disorders such as retrograde ejaculation, ejaculation failure, or decreased semen volume as well as breast enlargement and breast tenderness.1b RecommendationsStrength ratingUse 5α-reductase inhibitors (5-ARIs) in men who have moderate-to-severe LUTS and an increased risk of disease progression (e.g., prostate volume > 40 mL).StrongCounsel patients about the slow onset of action of 5-ARIs.Strong
