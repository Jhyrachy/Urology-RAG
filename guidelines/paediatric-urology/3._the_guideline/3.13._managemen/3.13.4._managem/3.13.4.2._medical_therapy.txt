3.13.4.2. Medical therapy. Antimuscarinic/anticholinergic medication reduces/prevents detrusor overactivity and lowers intravesical pressure [732,733]. Effects and side effects depend on the distribution of the M1-M5 receptors [734]. In the bladder, the subtype M2 and M3 are present [733,735]. Oxybutynin is the most frequently used in children with neurogenic bladder with a success rate of up to 93% [736,737]. Dose-dependent side-effects (such as dry mouth, facial flushing, blurred vision heat intolerance etc.) limit its use. Intravesical administration gives a significant higher bioavailability due to the circumvention of the intestinal first pass metabolism, as well as possible local influence on C-fiber-related activity and can be responsible for different clinical effect [738,739]. Intravesical administration should be considered in patients with severe side-effects, as long-term results demonstrated that it was well-tolerated and effective [740,741]. Transdermal administration also leads to a substantially lower ratio of N-desethyloxybutynin to oxybutynin plasma levels, however, there are treatment-related skin reactions in 12 out of 41 patients [742]. There are some concerns about central anticholinergic adverse effects associated with oxybutynin [743,744]. A double blinded cross-over trial, as well as a case control study, showed no deleterious effect on children’s attention and memory [705,745] . Tolterodine, solifenacine, fesoterodin, trospium chloride and propiverine and their combinations can also be used in children [746-754]. The oral dosage for oxybutynin is up to 0.2 mg/kg [733] given three times daily. The intravesical dosage can be up to 0.7 mg/kg/daily and transdermal 1.3-3.9 mg/daily. The dosage of the other drugs is: Tolterodine 0.5 – 4 mg/day divided in two doses, Solifenacin 1.25 up to 10 mg per day (single dose), fesoterodine 4-8 mg per day (single dose) Propiverin 0.8 mg/kg/day divided in two dosages and trospium chloride up to 3 times 15 mg starting with 3 times 5 mg. Except for oxybutynin, all other anticholinergic drugs are off-label use, which should be explained to the caregivers. Early prophylactic treatment with anticholinergics showed a lower rate of renal deterioration as well as a lower rate of progression to bladder augmentation [719,755]. Beta-3 agonists like mirabegron as an adjuvant treatment has been shown to be effective and safe in some recent studies of children (> five years) and adolescents [756-759]. Alpha-adrenergic antagonists may facilitate emptying in children with neurogenic bladder [760]. Doxazosin with an initial dose of 0.5 to 1.0 mg or tamsulosin hydrochloride in a medium (0.0002-0.0004 mg/kg/day) or high dose (0.0004-0,0008 mg/kg/day) has been given to children with neurogenic bladders [760-762]. It was well tolerated but not effective at least in one study [761]. Botulinum toxin A injections: In neurogenic bladders that are refractory to anticholinergics, the off-label use of suburothelial or intramuscular injection of onabotulinum toxin A into the detrusor muscle is a treatment option [653,654]. In children, continence could be achieved in 32-100% of patients, a decrease in maximum detrusor pressure of 32% to 54%, an increase of maximum cystometric capacity from 27% to 162%, and an improvement in bladder compliance of 28%-176% [653]. Onabotulinum toxin A seems to be more effective in bladders with obvious detrusor muscle over-activity, whereas non-compliant bladders without obvious contractions are unlikely to respond [763,764]. Also, the injections into the trigone seems to be save in regard of reflux and upper tract damage; if it has some benefit is not further investigated [657]. Of the patients with failed augmentation cystoplasty, 43% responded well to intra-detrusor onabotulinum toxin A injections in a recent series of 30 patients [765]. The most used dose of onabotulinum toxin A is 10 to 12 U/kg with a maximum dose between 200 U and 360 U [766]. A randomized trail demonstrated, that 200IE have greater efficacy in reducing bladder pressure and increasing bladder capacity compared to 50 or 100IE [767]. Onabotolinum toxin A can be effective between three to twelve (0-25) months and repeated injections are effective up to ten years in one study [768-770]. Urethral sphincter onabotulinum toxin A injection has been shown to be effective in decreasing urethral resistance and improve voiding. The evidence is still too low to recommend its routine use in decreasing outlet resistance, but it could be considered as an alternative in refractory cases [771,772]. Neuromodulation Intravesical electrical stimulation of the bladder [773-775], sacral nerve stimulation [776,777] and transcutaneous neuromodulation [668] are still experimental and cannot be recommended outside of clinical trials. The same is true for the intradural somatic-to-autonomic nerve anastomosis[778,779]. Urethral Dilatation The aim is to lower the pop-off pressure by lowering the detrusor leak-point pressure by dilatation of the external sphincter under general anaesthesia up to 36 Charr. Some studies showed, that especially in females, the procedure is safe and in selected patients, effective [780-782]. Vesicostomy Vesicostomy - preferably a Blocksom stoma [783] - is an option to reduce bladder pressure in children/new-borns, if the caregivers are incompliant with IC and/or IC through the urethra is extremely difficult or impossible [784]. Especially in the young infant with severe upper tract dilatation or infections, a vesicostomy should be considered. In some patients it may be also a good long-term solution to prevent infection and renal deterioration [785]. Drawbacks are the difficulty fitting and maintaining a collecting appliance in older patients. A cystostomy button may be an alternative, with a complication rate (mostly UTI) of up to 34% within a mean follow-up of 37 months [786].
