5.4. Inguinal exploration and initial management. 5.4.1. Orchidectomy Orchidectomy including division of the spermatic cord at the internal inguinal ring represents the standard of care for patients with a TGTC. A scrotal approach should be avoided when TC is suspected as it results in a higher local recurrence rate [67]. 5.4.2. Testis-sparing surgery In men with GCTs, orchidectomy represents the standard of care as pathological studies describe multifocal and/or adjacent GCNIS in 20-30% of patients [68]. Testis sparing surgery when feasible, may be considered in synchronous bilateral tumours or in tumours in solitary testis [69]. In these settings, at least two additional testicular biopsies should be taken to exclude GCNIS [70]. Testis-sparing surgery (TSS) is a valid treatment option in men with interstitial cell or benign testicular tumours and may prevent hypogonadism and infertility in young men. These tumours are often small although larger lesions may be difficult to differentiate from GCT. Thus, TSS may be considered in patients with small or indeterminate testicular masses, negative tumour markers and a normal contralateral testis to avoid over-treatment of potentially benign lesions and preserve testicular function [69,71]. Patients should be informed that cancer may be present even in small (i.e., < 1 cm) masses [69,72,73]. In both settings, TSS should be offered together with frozen section examination (FSE). Frozen section examination has shown to be reliable and highly concordant with final histopathology in expert hands, with a 99% and 96% of sensitivity and specificity respectively and 98% and 97% of PPV and NPV, respectively [71]. In cases of discordance between FSE and final pathology delayed orchiectomy may be required. In cases of a history of GCT or indeterminate small testicular lesion, patients should be made aware of the following issues regarding TSS practice: that limited data exists regarding oncological safety of TSS; that local recurrence rates have been reported (up to 26.9%), when TC is present in the specimen [69,74] and that TSS has implications for ongoing surveillance of the testis. Similarly, patients should be informed about the role and impact of adjuvant radiotherapy when GCNIS is present, potential infertility, the need for hormonal supplementation despite parenchyma preservation [69,75] and that discordance between FSE and final pathology requiring a delayed orchidectomy. 5.4.3. Insertion of testicular prosthesis Testicular prosthesis should be offered to all patients receiving unilateral or bilateral orchidectomy [76]. The prosthesis can be inserted at orchidectomy or subsequently without adverse consequences, including infection [77]. 5.4.4. Contralateral biopsy Contralateral biopsy has been advocated to exclude GCNIS [78] and routine policy in some countries [79]. It is, however, controversial to recommend routine contralateral biopsy in all patients due to the low incidence of GCNIS and metachronous contralateral testicular tumours (up to 9% and approximately 2.5%, respectively) [80,81], the morbidity of GCNIS treatment (see section 6.1.1), and the fact that most metachronous tumours are low stage at presentation [82,83]. Nevertheless, the risks and benefits of biopsy of the contralateral testis should be discussed with TC patients at high risk for contralateral GCNIS, i.e., testicular volume < 12 mL, and/or a history of cryptorchidism. Contralateral biopsy is not necessary in patients > 40 years without risk factors [70,84,85]. Patients should be informed that a subsequent GCT may arise despite a negative biopsy [86]. When indicated, a two-site surgical testicular biopsy is the technical procedure recommended [70].
