3.2.3. diagnostic evaluation. history taking physical examination key evaluating boys undescended testes. localisation studies using different imaging modalities usually without additional benefit. 3.2.3.1. history caregivers asked maternal paternal risk factors, including hormonal exposure genetic hormonal disorders. child history previously descended testes might suggestive testicular ascent . prior inguinal surgery indicative secondary undescended testes due entrapment. 3.2.3.2. physical examination undescended testis pursued carefully advancing examining fingers along inguinal canal towards pubis region, perhaps help lubricant. possible inguinal testis felt bounce fingers . non-palpable testis supine position may become palpable child sitting squatting position. testis identified along normal path descent, possible ectopic locations must considered. event unilateral non-palpable testis, contralateral testis needs examined. size location important prognostic implications. compensatory hypertrophy suggests testicular absence atrophy . nevertheless, preclude surgical exploration since sign compensatory hypertrophy specific enough . event bilateral undescended testes evidence sign dsds, genital ambiguity, scrotal hyperpigmentation, evaluation including endocrinological genetic assessment becomes mandatory . 3.2.3.3. imaging studies imaging studies cannot determine certainty testis present . ultrasound (us) lacks diagnostic sensitivity detect testis confidently establish absence intra-abdominal testis . consequently, use different imaging modalities, us magnetic resonance imaging (mri) , undescended testes limited recommended specific selected clinical scenarios (e.g. identification m√ºllerian structures cases suspicion dsds) .
