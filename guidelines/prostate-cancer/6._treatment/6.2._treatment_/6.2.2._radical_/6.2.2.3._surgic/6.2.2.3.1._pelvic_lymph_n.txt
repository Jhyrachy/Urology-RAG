6.2.2.3.1. Pelvic lymph node dissection. A SR has demonstrated that performing PLND during RP failed to improve oncological outcomes, including survival [536]. Moreover, two RCTs have failed to show a benefit of an extended approach vs. a limited PLND on early oncologic outcomes [537,538]. Extended PLND includes removal of the nodes overlying the external iliac artery and vein, the nodes within the obturator fossa located cranially and caudally to the obturator nerve, and the nodes medial and lateral to the internal iliac artery. With this template, the majority of patients are correctly staged [539] and as such, ePLND provides accurate information for staging and prognosis [540]
