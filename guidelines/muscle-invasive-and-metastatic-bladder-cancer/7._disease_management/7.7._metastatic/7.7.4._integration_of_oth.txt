7.7.4. Integration of other agents. 7.7.4.1. Antibody drug conjugates Enfortumab vedotin monotherapy The first antibody drug conjugate to report encouraging data in patients previously treated with platinum-based chemotherapy and checkpoint inhibition was EV. The phase-II single-arm study EV-201 in 125 patients showed a confirmed objective response rate of 44%, including 12% complete responses [532]. This data led to accelerated FDA and EMA approval for EV in locally-advanced or metastatic UC patients who previously received a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor and platinum-containing chemotherapy, as well as for cisplatin-ineligible patients who received one or more prior lines of therapy [533,534]. Another cohort of the same EV-201 trial demonstrated similar promising results in 91 patients that were cisplatin-ineligible and had received prior IO [535]. A phase III RCT (n = 608) comparing EV with single-agent chemotherapy after prior platinum chemotherapy and checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy demonstrated significant survival benefit of almost 4 months (12.88 months vs. 8.97 months; HR 0.7, 95% CI: 0.56–0.89) [536]. The most common treatment-related AEs included alopecia (45%), peripheral neuropathy (34%), fatigue (31%, 7.4% ≥ grade 3), decreased appetite (31%), diarrhoea (24%), nausea (23%) and skin rash (16%, 7.4% ≥ grade 3). 7.7.4.2. Antibody drug conjugate Sacituzumab govetican Another new and also promising antibody drug conjugate is sacituzumab govitecan, consisting of a humanised monoclonal antibody targeting trophoblast cell surface antigen 2 (Trop-2) conjugated to SN-38, the active metabolite of irinotecan. Sacituzumab govitecan was tested in 113 platinum and immunotherapy pre-treated metastatic UC (mUC) patients [532] and achieved an ORR of 27% and a total of 77% had a decrease in measurable disease, median PFS was 5.4 months and median OS 10.9 months [537]. Side effects consisted of haematological toxicities (neutropenia 34% ≥ grade 3; febrile neutropenia 10% ≥ grade 3), fatigue (52%), alopecia (47%), nausea (60%), diarrhea (65%, 10% ≥ grade 3) and decreased appetite (36%) [537]. Sacituzumab govitecan has received accelerated FDA approval for metastatic UC with prior platinum and IO pre-treatment. Several trials using sacituzumab govitecan as monotherapy or in combination are ongoing. 7.7.4.3. FGFR inhibition Genomic profiling of UC has revealed common potentially actionable genomic alterations including alterations in FGFR [538]. Erdafitinib is a pan-FGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor and the first FDA-approved targeted therapy for mUC with susceptible FGFR2/3 alterations following platinum-containing chemotherapy. The phase II trial of erdafitinib included 99 patients whose tumour harboured an FGFR3 mutation or FGFR2/3 fusion and who had disease progression following chemotherapy [234]. The confirmed ORR was 40% and an additional 39% of patients had stable disease. A total of 22 patients had previously received immunotherapy with only one patient achieving a response, yet the response rate for erdafitinib for this subgroup was 59%. At a median follow-up of 24 months, the median PFS was 5.5 months (95% CI: 4.0–6.0) and the median OS was 11.3 months (95% CI: 9.7–15.2) [234]. Treatment-related AEs of ≥ grade 3 occurred in 46% of patients. Common AEs of ≥ grade 3 were hyponatraemia (11%), stomatitis (10%), and asthenia (7%) and 13 patients discontinued erdafitinib due to AEs, including retinal pigment epithelial detachment, hand-foot syndrome, dry mouth, and skin/nail events. In a long-term follow up, the efficacy and safety profile remained similar with no new safety signals with longer follow-up [539]. In the recent THOR cohort 1 trial, a phase 3 trial of erdafitinib as compared with chemotherapy (docetaxel or vinflunine) in patients with metastatic UC with susceptible FGFR3/2 alterations who had progression after one or two previous treatments that included an anti–PD-1 or anti–PD-L1 demonstrated an improvement in OS with erdafitinib as compared to chemotherapy (12.1 months vs. 7.8 months; HR 0.64 (0.47 to 0.88); P=0.005). Median PFS was also longer with erdafitinib than with chemotherapy (5.6 vs. 2.7 months; (HR 0.58 (0.44 -0.78) [540]. Treatment-related toxicity grade ≥ 3 was similar in the two groups. The most common treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or higher were palmar–plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (9.6%), stomatitis (8.1%), onycholysis (5.9%), and hyperphosphatemia (5.2%) in the erdafitinib group. Data on cohort 2 with 351 patients, anti-PD-(l1) naïve and progressing after one prior treatment line compared Erdafitinib with pembrolizumab. No difference in the primary endpoint OS was detected (10.9 versus 11.1 months, HR 1.18 (0.92-1.51) [541]. Overall response rate was 40.0% and 21.6% and median duration of response was 4.3 and 14.4 months for erdafitinib and pembrolizumab, respectively. 64.7% and 50.9% of patients in the erdafitinib and pembrolizumab arms had ≥ 1 grade 3-4 adverse events. In addition to erdafitinib, several other FGFR inhibitors are being evaluated including infigratinib which has demonstrated promising activity [235]. A phase 2/3 trial of the pan-FGFR inhibitor, rogaratinib versus chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced or metastatic UC with FGFR1-3 mRNA overexpression demonstrated similar outcomes as compared to chemotherapy [542]. The increased identification of FGFR3 mutations/fusion has led to several ongoing trials with different agents and combinations in different disease settings.
