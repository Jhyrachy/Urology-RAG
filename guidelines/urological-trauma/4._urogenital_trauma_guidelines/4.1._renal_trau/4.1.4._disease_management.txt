4.1.4. Disease management. 4.1.4.1. Non-operative management The non-operative management of renal trauma can be viewed as a “package of care”; a stepwise approach starting with conservative treatment, followed by minimally invasive and/or surgical exploration, if necessary. It should be noted that an algorithm for “package of care” will vary in different centres according to available interventions; however, the importance of escalation in treatment interventions should be emphasised [29]. This approach has likely resulted in the rate of nephrectomy for high-grade renal injuries decreasing over time [60]. 4.1.4.1.1. Blunt renal injuries Haemodynamic stability is the primary criterion for the management of all renal injuries. Non-operative management has become the treatment of choice for most cases. In stable patients, this means a period of bed rest, serial blood tests, regular observation and re-imaging as indicated [26]. Primary conservative management is associated with a lower rate of nephrectomies, and no increase in immediate or long-term morbidity [61]. Grade 1-3 injuries are managed non-operatively [62,63]. Grade 4 injuries are also mostly treated conservatively, but the requirement for subsequent intervention is higher [64]. Persistent urinary extravasation from an otherwise viable kidney after blunt trauma usually responds to stent placement and/or percutaneous drainage [65]. Grade 5 injuries often present with haemodynamic instability and major associated injuries. There is thus a higher rate of exploration and nephrectomy [66,67]. However, several studies now support expectant management in patients with Grade 4 and 5 injuries [29,30,68-72]. Similarly, unilateral main arterial injuries or arterial thrombosis are normally managed non-operatively in haemodynamically stable patients with surgical repair reserved for bilateral artery injuries or injuries involving a solitary functional kidney [73]. Pre-hospital prolonged warm ischaemia usually results in irreparable damage and renal loss. One study designed a nomogram to predict the need for an intervention to stop bleeding in high-grade renal trauma. Factors which increased risk of intervention were a haematoma size of > 12 cm, penetrating trauma, vascular contrast extravasation, pararenal haematoma extension, concomitant injuries, and shock [74]. 4.1.4.1.2. Penetrating renal injuries Penetrating abdominal wounds have traditionally been managed surgically. However, selective non-operative management of penetrating abdominal wounds is now accepted following detailed assessment in stable patients [64,75-77]. For renal injuries, the site of the wound, haemodynamic stability, and diagnostic imaging are the main determinants for intervention. The majority of low-grade stab wounds posterior to the anterior axillary line can be managed non-operatively in stable patients [78]. Grade 3 or higher injuries due to stab wounds in stable patients can be managed expectantly but warrant closer observation as the clinical course is more unpredictable and associated with a higher rate of delayed intervention [78,79]. High-grade injuries, concomitant abdominal injuries and gunshot wounds are most likely to fail non-operative management [77]. A gunshot wound is an independent risk factor for nephrectomy in grade IV and V traumatic renal injuries, compared with stab wounds [80]. Overall, non-operative management of penetrating injuries in selected stable patients is associated with a successful outcome in up to 50% of stab wounds and up to 40% of gunshot wounds [30,81-84]. 4.1.4.1.3. Selective angioembolisation Selective angioembolisation (AE) has a key role in the non-operative management of blunt renal trauma in haemodynamically stable patients [85]. Currently there are no validated criteria to identify patients who require AE and its use in renal trauma remains variable. Accepted CT findings indicating the need for AE are active extravasation of contrast, arteriovenous fistula (AVF) and pseudo-aneurysm [86]. The presence of both active extravasation of contrast and a large haematoma (> 25 mm depth) predict the need for AE with good accuracy [86,87]. Angioembolisation has been utilised in the non-operative management of all grades of renal injury; however, it is likely to be most beneficial in the setting of high-grade renal trauma (AAST > 3) [88-90]. Non-operative management of high-grade renal trauma, where AE is included in the management algorithm, can be successful in up to 94.9% of Grade 3, 89% of Grade 4 and 76% of Grade 5 injuries [85,88,91-93]. Increasing grade of renal injury is associated with increased risk of failed AE and need for repeat intervention [94]. Gross haematuria, haemodynamic instability, Grade 5 trauma and urinary extravasation are significant predictors of AE failure [95]. Repeat embolisation prevents nephrectomy in 67% of patients. Open surgery after failed embolisation usually results in nephrectomy [94,96]. Despite concerns regarding parenchymal infarction and the use of iodinated contrast media, AE does not appear to affect the occurrence or outcome of acute kidney injury following renal trauma [97]. For high-grade injuries, AE has also been shown to have a high success rate and to provide the greatest protection of renal function, with no difference in renal function after long-term follow-up [98]. In severe polytrauma or high operative risk, the main artery may be embolised, either as a definitive treatment or as a step to a more controlled nephrectomy. The evidence supporting AE in penetrating renal trauma is sparse. One study found that AE is three times more likely to fail in penetrating trauma [75]. However, AE has been used successfully to treat acute haemorrhage, AVF and pseudo-aneurysms resulting from penetrating renal trauma [99]. 4.1.4.1.4. Ureteral stenting and urinary catheterisation In the management of high-grade renal trauma with collecting system injuries, ureteral stenting in asymptomatic patients has proven no clear benefits. Current evidence suggests intervention (ureteral stenting, nephrostomy or perirenal drainage) only when patients develop symptoms (flank pain, fever, leucocytosis) related with persistent urinary leaks [65,100]. Catheterisation is not necessary in stable patients with low-grade injury. Patients with severe visible haematuria, who require monitoring or stenting, benefit from catheterisation. A longer period of catheterisation is required if a stent is placed. Once the haematuria lightens and the patient is mobile, the catheter should be removed. 4.1.4.1.5. Repeat imaging (early) Computed tomography scans should be performed on patients with fever, unexplained decreased haematocrit, or significant flank pain. Repeat imaging is also recommended in high-grade injury and in penetrating trauma two to four days after trauma to minimise the risk of missed complications. Repeat imaging can be safely omitted for patients with Grade 1-3 injuries as long as they remain clinically well [101,102]. 4.1.4.2. Surgical management 4.1.4.2.1. Indications for renal exploration A non- or transient- response to initial fluid resuscitation is a strong indication for exploration [75,76]. There is a trend towards ongoing resuscitation and AE [103]. Exploration is influenced by aetiology and grade of injury, transfusion requirements, the need to explore associated abdominal injuries, and the discovery of an expanding or pulsatile peri-renal haematoma at laparotomy [104]. Haemodynamic instable grade 5 vascular injuries are an indication for exploration [91,105]. 4.1.4.2.2. Operative findings and reconstruction The overall exploration rate for blunt trauma is low [106]. The goals of exploration following renal trauma are vascular control and renal salvage. Most series recommend the transperitoneal approach for surgery [107,108]. Entering the retroperitoneum and leaving the confined haematoma undisturbed within the perinephric fascia is recommended; temporarily packing the fossa tightly with laparotomy pads can salvage the kidney in instances of intra-operative haemorrhage [109]. Access to the pedicle is obtained either through the posterior parietal peritoneum, which is incised over the aorta, just medial to the inferior mesenteric vein or by bluntly dissecting along the plane of the psoas muscle fascia, adjacent to the great vessels, and directly placing a vascular clamp on the hilum [109]. Stable haematomas detected during exploration for associated injuries should not be opened. Central or expanding haematomas indicate injuries of the renal pedicle, aorta, or vena cava and are potentially life-threatening and warrant further exploration [110]. Feasibility of renal reconstruction should be judged during the operation. The overall rate of patients who undergo a nephrectomy during exploration is approximately 30% [111]. Other intra-abdominal injuries also increase the likelihood of nephrectomy [112]. Mortality is associated with overall severity of the injury and not often a consequence of the renal injury itself [113]. High velocity gunshot injuries make reconstruction difficult and nephrectomy is usually required [114]. Renorrhaphy is the most common reconstructive technique. Partial nephrectomy is required when non-viable tissue is detected. Watertight closure of the collecting system is desirable, although closing the parenchyma over the injured collecting system is acceptable. The use of haemostatic agents and sealants in reconstruction is helpful [115]. In all cases, drainage of the ipsilateral retroperitoneum is recommended. The repair of vascular injuries is seldom, if ever, effective [116]. Repair should be attempted in patients with a solitary kidney or bilateral injuries [117]. Nephrectomy for main artery injury has outcomes similar to those of vascular repair and does not worsen post-treatment renal function in the short-term. Bleeding or dissection of the main renal artery may also be managed with a stent.
