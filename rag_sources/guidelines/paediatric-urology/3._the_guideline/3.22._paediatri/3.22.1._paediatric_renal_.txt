trauma (90%), blunt abdominal trauma kidney commonly affected organ, accounting 10% blunt abdominal injuries . children likely adults sustain renal injuries blunt trauma due several anatomical factors, including decreased perirenal fat, weaker abdominal musculature, relative large size kidney relation rest body, foetal lobulations result higher likelihood local parenchymal disruption, less ossified rib cage . blunt renal trauma frequently associated injury organs well . 3.22.1.2. classification systems renal injuries classified according kidney injury scale american association surgery

history, physical examination laboratory evaluation. renal involvement may associated abdominal flank tenderness, lower rib fractures, fractures vertebral pedicles, trunk contusions abrasions, haematuria. vital signs monitored initial evaluation give reliable indication urgency situation. important consider children, unlike adults, able maintain blood pressure, even presence hypovolaemia, due compliance vascular tree mechanisms cardiac compensation . compulsory consider clinical aspects involved, including history, physical examination, consciousness child, overall clinical status laboratory findings decide diagnostic algorithm whether child needs imaging studies. severe renal injuries, 65% patients suffer gross haematuria 33% non-visible haematuria, 2% haematuria . several reports significant renal injuries manifest little even blood urine . 3.22.1.3.1. choice imaging method fast-ultrasound severe trauma haemodynamically instable patients, fast (focussed assessment sonography trauma) used identify hemoperitoneum, high specificity (95%) low sensitivity (33-89%) negative predictive value (50%). however, sensitivity specificity kidney trauma retroperitoneal hemorrhage low, therefore recommended sole diagnostic tool . computed tomography computed tomography scanning imaging modality choice patients suspicion renal injuries, since widely available, quick provides accurate grading . ideally performed three phases: arterial phase detect vascular injury active bleeding, nephrogenic phase detect parenchymal lacerations, delayed phase detect injury collecting system ureter. furthermore, ct scanning detect associated intra-abdominal injuries, frequently associated renal trauma, especially grade iii – v . scanning protocol adapted pediatric patients according alara (as low reasonable achievable) principles reduce amount ionizing radiation much possible. ultrasound (contrast-enhanced) ultrasound considered sole investigation patients mild symptoms indications ct-scanning, mechanism trauma condition patient suggest presence injury organs urinary tract. although conventional ultrasound accurate grade renal trauma, could role contrast-enhanced ultrasound (ceus) identify parenchymal lesions, however technique cannot detect injuries urinary tract collecting system since contrast agent excreted kidney . ultrasound performed follow-up renal trauma reduce amount radiation. however, even high-grade renal trauma, routine repeat imaging may avoidable asymptomatic, stable patients . 3.22.1.4. disease management modern management trauma multidisciplinary, requiring paediatricians, emergency physicians, surgeons, urologists, specialties required. non-surgical conservative management bed rest, fluids monitoring become standard approach treating blunt renal trauma. high-grade renal injuries, conservative approach effective recommended hemodynamically stable children . however, approach requires close clinical observation intermittent re-assessment patient’s overall condition. therefore, good initial trauma ct delayed images check urinary extravasation recommended, since patients urine leak higher morbidities, including febrile episodes increased requirement operative image-guided interventions . however, early drainage seem prevent persistent urinary extravasation complications . therefore, reserve stenting and/or percutaneous drainage patient symptomatic . emergency intervention indicated haemodynamic instability, available angio-embolisation ongoing delayed bleeding preferred compared open surgery. results angio-embolisation evaluated successful 92% patients grade iii-iv (294/322) 76% grade v (63/82) injuries. furthermore, success rate 90% (312/346) hemodynamically stable patients, 63% (42/66) hemodynamically unstable patients . absolute indications surgery include persistent bleeding expanding unconfined haematoma haemodynamic instability. relative indications surgery massive urinary extravasation extensive non-viable renal tissue . follow-up paediatric patients renal trauma, routine blood pressure checks diagnose hypertension recommended long-term follow-up since posttraumatic renal hypertension rate varies 4.2 – 18%, especially cases concomitant vascular injury . however, dearth long-term data risk developing hypertension children. 3.22.1.5. recommendations
