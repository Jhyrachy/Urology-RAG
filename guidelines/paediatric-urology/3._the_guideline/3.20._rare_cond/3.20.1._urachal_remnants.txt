3.20.1. Urachal remnants. 3.20.1.1. Introduction The urachus is an embryonic structure arising as a result of the separation of the allantois from the ventral cloaca. The allantois appears on day sixteen as a tiny, fingerlike outpouching from the caudal wall of the yolk sac, which is contiguous with the ventral cloaca at one end and the umbilicus at the other. The ventral portion of the cloaca develops into the bladder after cloacal division by the urogenital septum. Thus, the bladder initially extends all the way to the umbilicus [1386]. With progressive foetal development, as the bladder descends into the pelvis, the attachment between the umbilicus and the urachus becomes looser and the apical portion progressively narrows to a small, epithelialised, fibromuscular strand by the fourth or fifth month of gestation. The urachus then obliterates completely by birth, forming the median umbilical ligament [1387-1389]. The urachus varies from 3 to 10 cm in length and from 8 to 10 mm in diameter. It is a three-layered tubular structure, the innermost layer being lined with transitional epithelium, the middle layer composed of connective tissue, and the outermost muscular layer in continuity with the detrusor muscle [1390]. Urachal remnants (URs) originate from failure of the obliteration of the allantois, resulting in a urachal anomaly such as (1) urachal sinus, (2) urachal cyst, (3) vesico-urachal diverticulum, and (4) patent urachus [1387,1388,1391]. Most often the urachal anomaly is asymptomatic, but it occasionally may become infected, may cause urinary symptoms, or develop a urachal carcinoma in later life [1390,1392]. 3.20.1.2. Epidemiology Reports of occurrence rates in the literature vary broadly from a very rare disease in the older literature to a fairly common problem. Robert et al. found that URs were present in 61.7% of patients younger than 16 years [1393]. They also noted that the frequency of URs decreased with increasing age. This supports a physiological regression of URs with age. Stopak et al. attributed this upsurge to increased awareness among community paediatricians and improvements in US that made visualisation of urachal remnants easier [1394]. Clinical studies and paediatric autopsy studies in the past have shown a much lower incidence. Rubin found an incidence of 1 in 7,610 cases of patent urachus and 1 in 5,000 cases of urachal cysts [1395]. Nix et al. noted three anomalies out of 1,168,760 hospital admissions, and Blichert-Toft et al. reported five UR cases out of 40,000 patients [1396,1397]. The incidence rate in males is a little higher than in females [1398,1399]. The range of the various URs reported in the literature is 10% to 48% for patent urachus, 31% to 43% for urachal cyst, 18% to 43% for urachal sinus and 3% to 4% for urachal diverticulum [1400,1401]. 3.20.1.3. Symptoms A patent urachus causes continuous or intermittent urine leakage from the umbilicus causing umbilical granulation and erythema in infants [1400]. A urachal cyst is usually diagnosed (1) incidentally, or (2) when it becomes infected causing abdominal pain and discharge of pus from the umbilicus or recurrent UTIs when it drains into the bladder. The most common symptom is umbilical granulation, discharge and erythema in infants and abdominal pain in older children [1400]. Other symptoms of infected urachal anomalies can vary from high fever, abdominal pain, urinary tract infections, LUTS and/or an abdominal mass [1401-1405]. A urachal diverticulum is often asymptomatic and is usually found incidentally during investigations for other problems. An alternating sinus can empty either into the bladder or the umbilicus and this characteristic is responsible for various presentations [1406]. Infection has been reported as the most common complication in urachal anomalies [1407]. Severe infection may develop into peritonitis and sepsis. Cultures from umbilical discharge usually show Staphylococcus, Streptococcus and E. Coli [1408]. Other congenital anomalies: Ashley found a simultaneous anomaly in 17 of 46 children, of which VUR was the most common anomaly (6 patients) [1409]. Other investigators reported associated anomalies in cases of persistent URs including meatal stenosis, hypospadias, umbilical and inguinal hernias, cryptorchidism, anal atresia, omphalocele, ureteropelvic obstruction and most frequently, VUR [1399,1410-1412]. 3.20.1.4. Diagnosis In the majority of cases with complaints of a UR, a careful history and physical examination will confirm the suspicion of a UR. In many patients this can be confirmed by US studies [1393]. An MRI or CT scan may be necessary in a minority of children [1404]. Because of the association with other congenital abnormalities, other studies such as a VCUG or cystoscopy may be undertaken as well. In general, the VCUG is only undertaken when the child also presents with UTI or when the US shows signs of upper tract abnormalities. For the diagnosis per se it is not necessary [1413]; however, a VCUG may be useful for defining the type of urachal anomaly and evaluating a population that may be at higher risk for VUR. 3.20.1.5. Treatment If a UR is symptomatic, the standard approach has been surgical removal. In most cases it should be done as an elective procedure, following appropriate treatment of active inflammation, and infection is possible. Pre-operative IV-dosage of antibiotic like Cefazolin is generally sufficient. A Pfannenstiel, periumbilical or infraumbilical midline incision can all be used for the open surgical approach [1403,1414]. Even in symptomatic infants a more conservative approach is possible as well, especially in children less than six months old. Observation and treatment with antibiotics if necessary and radiographic monitoring are a safe approach [1400,1415,1416]. Dethlefs et al. reported a 90% successful outcome [1402], while Naiditch et al. reported that 44 of 78 symptomatic patients resolved under observation [1405]. More recently the laparoscopic approach has been advocated, and shown to be safe [1416-1418]. Surgery is not without risk. The rate of complications following surgical removal varies from 0 to 20%: usually wound infections [1394,1402-1405,1414]. Considering the probable additional risk of anaesthesia in very young children any surgical procedure needs to be assessed carefully [1419,1420]. 3.20.1.6. Pathology of removed remnants Removed specimens may show inflammation or a cystic structure [1402]. Patients presenting without symptoms are as likely to have epithelial elements in the UR as those presenting with symptoms [1404]. 3.20.1.7. Urachal cancer Urachal anomalies are thought to be associated with an increased risk of bladder adenocarcinoma in adults, and urachal adenocarcinoma has an estimated incidence of 0.18 per 100,000 individuals yearly [1421]. These cases account for 0.1 to 0.3% of all bladder malignancies and 20 to 39% of bladder adenocarcinomas [1422]. Urachal adenocarcinoma (UrC) is very rare, especially when one considers that up to 62% of children under 16 years of age may have a UR [1393,1423]. A study by Copp et al. found no association between the presence of UR symptoms and the presence or absence of epithelial tissue in pathology specimens, leading them to conclude that UR symptoms have poor predictive value for malignancy potential in these remnants [1399]. Gleason et al. found that 5,721 URs would need to be excised to prevent a single case of urachaladenocarcinoma out of the nearly 65,000 patients reviewed [1421]. Assuming that epithelium is required in the development of urachal adenocarcinoma, the extrapolated Number Needed to Treat (NNT) would be more than 8,000, as nearly 30% of urachal anomalies are void of an epithelial component. Less than 5% of urachal cancers have a non-epithelial origin such as sarcoma [1424]. The presenting symptoms in adults are different from those in children: in a study of 130 adult patients, Ashley et al. found that 49% presented with haematuria and 27% with pain. In 51% a urachal carcinoma was diagnosed: adenocarcinoma, with 58% high grade cancer. In addition, 20% had metastases at diagnosis, the overall 5-year cancer specific survival rate in the UrC cohort was 49% [1425]. Stasis of urine and crystallisation promotors such as mucus or desquamated epithelium in the UR are most likely the cause for malignant degeneration as well as stone formation in the adult patient. At present no long-term follow-up on untreated UR in children is available and there is no evidence that urachal anomalies in children increase the likelihood of future malignancy [1400,1426]. 3.20.1.8. Conclusion Urachal remnants appear to be more common than previously reported. During the first 6-12 months of life spontaneous resolution is common. Excision of symptomatic urachal anomalies is an effective and safe means of treatment, with minimal morbidity. However, most patients with simple and asymptomatic lesions do not appear to benefit from excision, as the risk of malignancy later in life is vanishingly remote. Early intervention (< 6 months of age) should be reserved for patients with persistent documented urine draining from the urachus or a documented abscess. Incidental (US) UR management remains a challenge and should be done with patient and family involvement to make the most informed decision. While surgical intervention has minimal risk and morbidity, it is performed unnecessarily in a large proportion of asymptomatic patients due to the unnecessary removal of non-epithelial containing urachal anomalies and the inability to predict which anomalies will undergo malignant transformation [1427]. 3.20.1.9. Recommendation for management of urachal remnants RecommendationsStrength ratingUrachal remnants (URs) with no epithelial tissue carry little risk of malignant transformation.StrongAsymptomatic and non-specific atretic urachal remnants can safely be managed non-operatively.StrongUrachal remnants incidentally identified during diagnostic imaging for non-specific symptoms should also be observed non-operatively since they tend to resolve spontaneously.StrongA small UR, especially at birth, may be viewed as physiological.StrongUrachal remnants in patients younger than 6 months are likely to resolve with non-operative management.StrongFollow-up: is necessary only when symptomatic for 6 to 12 months.StrongSurgical excision of URs solely as a preventive measure against later malignancy appears to have minimal support in the literature.StrongOnly symptomatic URs should be safely removed by open or laparoscopic approach.StrongA voiding cystourethogram is only recommended when presenting with febrile UTIs.Strong
