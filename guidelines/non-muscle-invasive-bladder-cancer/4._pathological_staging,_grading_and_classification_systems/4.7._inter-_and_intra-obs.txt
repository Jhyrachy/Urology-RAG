4.7. Inter- and intra-observer variability in staging and grading. There is significant variability among pathologists for the diagnosis of CIS, for which agreement is achieved in only 70–78% of cases [66]. There is also inter-observer variability in the classification of stage T1 vs. Ta tumours and tumour grading in both the 1973 and 2022 classifications. The general conformity between pathologists in staging and grading is 50–60% [67-70]. The WHO 2004/2022 classification provides slightly better reproducibility than the 1973 classification [60].
