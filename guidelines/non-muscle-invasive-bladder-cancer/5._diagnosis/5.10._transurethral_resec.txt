5.10. Transurethral resection of TaT1 bladder tumours. 5.10.1. Strategy of the procedure The goals of TURB in TaT1 BC is to establish accurate pathological diagnosis/staging and completely remove all visible lesions. It is a crucial procedure in the management of BC. Transurethral resection of the bladder tumours should be performed systematically in individual steps [140,141] (see Section 5.14). The operative steps necessary to achieve a successful TURB include identifying the factors required to assign disease risk (number of tumours, size, architecture, location, concern for the presence of CIS, recurrent vs. primary tumour), clinical stage (bimanual examination under anaesthesia, assignment of clinical tumour stage), adequacy of the resection (visually complete resection, visualisation of muscle at the resection base), visualisation of tumour in the distal ureter and presence of complications (assessment for perforation) [140,142]. Documentation of cystoscopic tumour characteristics and consequent clinically predicted tumour grade and stage can help assign patients to post-TURB single instillation of chemotherapy (low grade non-invasive) and muscle invasive cancers to be fast tracked to definitive treatment [143]. To measure the size of the largest tumour, one can use the end of the cutting loop, which is approximately 1 cm wide, as a reference. Tumour architecture can be sessile, nodular, papillary, mixed papillary/solid or flat. 5.10.2. Surgical and technical aspects of tumour resection 5.10.2.1. Surgical strategy of resection (piecemeal/separate resection, en-bloc resection) A complete resection, performed by either fractioned or en-bloc technique, is essential to achieve a good prognosis [141,144]. Piecemeal resection in fractions (separate resection of the exophytic part of the tumour, the underlying bladder wall and the edges of the resection area) provides good information about the vertical and horizontal extent of the tumour [145]. Whilst this technique is carried out using a loop with diathermy (monopolar or bipolar), the Thulium-YAG laser is potentially a feasible alternative [146].En-bloc resection using monopolar or bipolar current, Thulium-YAG or Holmium-YAG or KTP-Green Light lasers is feasible in selected exophytic tumours. It provides high-quality resected specimens with the presence of detrusor muscle in 96–100% of cases [141,147-154]; however, its superiority over conventional TURB remains debatable [155,156]. Detrusor muscle sampling rates were no different between these techniques in a systematic review of 1,142 patients [157], and in a single centre RCT showing similar detrusor muscle sampling rates of 95% between conventional TURB and en-bloc resection [155]. Conversely, another systematic review of 4,484 patients revealed higher detrusor muscle sampling rates in favour of en-bloc resection [147], and a multicentre RCT found significantly higher detrusor muscle rates with en-bloc compared to conventional TURB (80.7 vs 71.1) [156]. Respect for tumour architecture increases the accuracy of T1 staging and the possibility of sub-staging while potentially reducing the risk of bladder perforation [147,152-155]. With regards oncological outcomes, two RCTs did not reveal a difference in time to recurrence between en-bloc resection and conventional TURB [155,156]. This has also been shown in two systematic reviews [147,157]. The technique selected is dependent on the size and location of the tumour and experience of the surgeon. The tumour size feasible for retrieval en-bloc is limited by the currently available endoscopic equipment and it has been shown that technical success declines with tumours larger than three cm [158]. With better detection of tumours and abnormal margins, methods of optical enhancement are expected to improve complete resection rates (see Section 5.11). 5.10.2.2. Evaluation of resection quality The absence of detrusor muscle in the specimen is associated with a significantly higher risk of residual disease, early recurrence, and tumour under-staging [159] (LE: 1b). The presence of detrusor muscle in the specimen is considered as a surrogate criterion of the resection quality [159] and is required (except in Ta LG/ G1 tumours). Surgical checklists and quality performance indicator programmes have been shown to increase surgical quality (accurate documentation of factors required to assign risk and sample detrusor muscle) and decrease recurrence rates [140,142,160-162]. The Panel have included a sample TURB checklist in Table 5.1 and reported quality indicators for the procedure in Table 9.1. It has been shown that surgical experience can improve TURB results, which supports the role of teaching programmes [159,163]. Virtual training on simulators is an emerging approach [164]. Its role in the teaching process still needs to be established [140]. Surgical experience and/or volume has been associated with risk of complications [165], recurrence [166] and survival [167] in retrospective studies. Despite a relatively low overall rate of detrusor muscle (DM) sampling, a collaborative study of 503 patients demonstrated that higher utilisation of surgical checklists by residents was associated with a higher rate of detrusor muscle sampling (62.9%) vs. ‘experts’ (50.6%) who’s utilisation of checklists was lower [140,162]. 5.10.2.3. Monopolar and bipolar resection Compared to monopolar resection, bipolar resection has been introduced to reduce the risk of complications (e.g., bladder perforation due to obturator nerve stimulation) and to produce better specimens. Currently, the results remain controversial [168-170], with significant inherent limitations due to selection bias, heterogeneity of surgical approach or inability to qualify surgeon experience. A systematic review of 13 RCTs (2,379 patients) showed no benefit of bipolar vs. monopolar TURB for efficacy and safety [170] while one meta-analysis of RCTs (n = 2,099) suggests a lower fall in haemoglobin and shorter hospital stay with bipolar resections [168] and another systematic review of RCTs and observational studies (n = 19,927) suggests lesser thermal artifacts in the specimen [169]. 5.10.2.4. Resection of small papillary bladder tumours at the time of transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) It is not uncommon to incidentally detect bladder tumours during TURP in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia. Provided these tumours are papillary, rather small and not extensively multifocal, it seems feasible to resect these tumours and continue with the resection of the prostate [171,172]. Simultaneous TURB and TURP does not appear to lead to any increased risk of tumour recurrence or progression [173]. Whilst most reports have suggested surgeons prefer to undertake saline irrigation following the combined TURBT and TURP, post-operative single instillation of chemotherapy also appears to be feasible and safe provided there is no capsular or bladder perforation [174].
