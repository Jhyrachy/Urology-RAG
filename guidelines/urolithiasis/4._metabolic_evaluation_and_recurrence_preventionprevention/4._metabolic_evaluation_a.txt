4. METABOLIC EVALUATION AND RECURRENCE PREVENTIONPREVENTION. 4.1. General metabolic considerations for patient work-up 4.1.1. Evaluation of patient risk After stone passage, every patient should be assigned to a low- or high-risk group (Table 3.3) for stone formation (Figure 4.1). Reliable stone analysis by infrared spectroscopy or X-ray diffraction and basic metabolic evaluation is mandatory for all stone formers. Only high-risk stone formers require specific metabolic evaluation. Stone type is the deciding factor for further diagnostic tests. The different stone types include: calcium oxalate;calcium phosphate;uric acid;ammonium urate;struvite (and infection stones);cystine;xanthine;2,8-Dihydroxyadenine;drug stones;stones of unknown composition. Figure 4.1: Assignment of patients to low- or high-risk groups for stone formation 4.1.2. Urine sampling Specific metabolic evaluation requires the collection of two consecutive 24-hour urine samples [63,538,539]. The collecting bottles should be prepared with 1 g thymol per liter or stored at < 8°C during collection to reduce bacterial proliferation [63]. Pre-analytical errors can be minimised by carrying out urinalysis immediately after collection. Alternatively, boric acid (10 g powder per urine container) can also be used, but this prevents the correct determination of pH [63]. The collecting method should be chosen in close cooperation with the laboratory. A pH < 5.5 in a 24-hour urine indicates hyper acidic urine (acidic arrest) [540-542]. In the course of alkalinising therapy for cystinuria and uric acid stones, urine pH should be assessed during the collection of freshly voided urine at different times throughout the day using sensitive pH dipsticks or a pH-meter [23,63,543]. A consensus statement stated that RTA is suspected if 24-hour urine pH is > 6.2 and fasting second-morning spot urine pH is > 5.8 [544,545]. Spot urine samples are an alternative sampling method, particularly when 24-hour urine collection is difficult, for example, in non-toilet-trained children [546]. Spot urine studies normally link the excretion rates to the creatinine [547], but these are of limited use because the results may vary with collection time and patients’ sex, body weight, and age. 4.1.3. Timing of specific metabolic work-up For the initial specific metabolic work-up, the patient should stay on a self-determined diet under normal daily conditions and should ideally be stone-free for at least twenty days [548]. Follow-up studies are necessary for patients taking medication for recurrence prevention [549]. The first follow-up 24-hour urine measurement is suggested eight to twelve weeks after starting pharmacological prevention of stone recurrence. This enables diet and/or drug dosage to be adjusted if urinary risk factors have not normalised, with further 24-hour urine measurements, if necessary. Once urinary parameters have been normalised, it is sufficient to perform a 24-hour urine evaluation every twelve months. On this issue, the Panel realises that there is only very limited published evidence. 4.1.4. Reference ranges of laboratory values Tables 4.1-4.4 provide the internationally accepted reference ranges for the different laboratory values in serum and urine.

Risk indices and additional diagnostic tools Several risk indices have been developed to describe the crystallisation risk for calcium oxalate or calcium phosphate in the urine [550-553]. However, clinical validation of these risk indices for recurrence prediction or therapy improvement is ongoing.
