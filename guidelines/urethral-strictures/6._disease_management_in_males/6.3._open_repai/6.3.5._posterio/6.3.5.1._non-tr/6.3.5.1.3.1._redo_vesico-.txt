6.3.5.1.3.1. Redo vesico-urethral anastomosis for vesico-urethral anastomotic stenosis after radical prostatectomy. After excision of the stenosis, ReDo vesico-urethral anastomosis (ReDo VUA) can be performed. This may be performed via a retropubic, perineal, combined abdominoperineal or robot-assisted approach. Nikolavsky et al., proposes a retropubic approach for VUAS involving the bladder neck, a perineal approach for short VUAS with intact bladder neck and an abdominoperineal approach for long segment (> 3 cm) VUAS with bladder neck involvement [408]. The ReDo VUA must be performed in a tension-free fashion which can be achieved either by mobilisation of the bladder (retropubic approach), mobilisation of the bulbar urethra with corporal splitting and inferior pubectomy if necessary (perineal approach) or both (abdominoperineal approach) [408,410]. Dinerman et al., reported a robot-assisted abdominoperineal approach in a case with 4.5 cm long complete obliteration [411]. Kirshenbaum et al., reported a pure robot-assisted abdominal approach. Regardless of the approach, the procedure is technically demanding due to the location deep under the pubic symphysis, and the proximity of the external sphincter [410]. As a consequence, surgical morbidity must be considered. As most patients with VUAS were healthy enough to undergo RP, most patients will likewise remain fit and eligible for VUAS surgical reconstruction [408,410].

ReDo VUA in non-irradiated patients yields patency rates of 60-91% (Table 6.9) [408-410,412-414]. Prior radiotherapy is a risk factor for failure [410,412]. In addition, radiation-induced bladder toxicity might provoke reduced bladder capacity, low bladder compliance, bladder spasms and pain, and urethral necrosis making reconstruction futile (see below) [386,410,415]. ReDo VUA should only be done in patients with adequate bladder function and in the absence of (peri)-urethral pathology (urethral necrosis, calcification, fistulation). Flaps (gracilis flap, peritoneal flap) to support and protect the anastomosis may be beneficial in irradiated patients [408]. With the transperineal approach, UI is inevitable, as this approach disrupts the external sphincter [409,410,412,414]. With the retropubic approach, Pfalzgraf et al., reported de novo incontinence in only four out of eleven (36%) patients [413]. In the series of Nikolavsky et al., where a retropubic approach was predominantly used, incontinence rate was 58% [408]. Kirshenbaum et al., reported no incontinence in five patients treated by robot-assisted retropubic approach [409]. Giudice et al., reported incontinence in one out of four patients treated with the retropubic approach [414]. Therefore, some authors [100,408,409] have proposed a preference for the retropubic approach in patients with good pre-operative urinary continence, although both approaches have never been directly compared for UI. In addition, the lack of perineal dissection by a retropubic approach will preserve the perineal anatomy and vascularisation which makes subsequent artificial urinary sphincter (AUS) less demanding [409]. Artificial urinary sphincter implantation should be deferred because of the risk of VUAS recurrence and difficulty of treating any recurrent VUAS with the cuff of the AUS in place [391,410]. The exact timing of AUS placement is not consensual in the literature but most advise waiting at least three to six months to ensure stability of the VUA patency [386,407,410,412]. Due to the complexity of this pathology the EAU Urethral Strictures Panel advises that VUAS reconstruction should be performed only in experienced high-volume centres, particularly after prior radiotherapy or other energy ablative treatments. Summary of evidenceLEReDo VUA has patency rates of 60-91% in non-irradiated patients and 67% in irradiated patients with obliterative VUAS or VUAS refractory to endoluminal treatment.3Urinary incontinence is inevitable after transperineal ReDo VUA. Artificial urinary sphincter placement can be offered after three to six months if patency of ReDo VUA is ensured.3De novo incontinence with retropubic ReDo VUA is 0-58%.3 RecommendationsStrength ratingPerform ReDo vesico-urethral anastomosis (VUA) in non-irradiated patients and irradiated patients with adequate bladder function with obliterative vesico-urethral anastomosis stricture or vesico-urethral anastomosis stricture refractory to endoluminal treatment.WeakWarn patient that urinary incontinence (UI) is inevitable after transperineal ReDo VUA and that subsequent anti-UI surgery might be needed in a next stage, after at least three to six months.StrongOffer ReDo VUA by retropubic approach if the patient is pre-operatively continent.Weak
