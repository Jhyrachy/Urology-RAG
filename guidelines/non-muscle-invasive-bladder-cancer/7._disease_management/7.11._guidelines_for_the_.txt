7.11. Guidelines for the treatment of TaT1 tumours and carcinoma in situ according to risk stratification. RecommendationsStrength ratingEAU risk group: LowOffer one immediate instillation of intravesical chemotherapy after transurethral resection of the bladder (TURB).StrongEAU Risk Group: IntermediateIn general, chemotherapy (the optimal schedule is unknown) is a reasonable first-line option in the majority of patients. One-year full-dose BCG treatment (induction plus three-weekly instillations at 3, 6 and 12 months), is an alternative option. The final choice should reflect the individual patient’s risk of recurrence and progression as well as the efficacy and side effects of each treatment modality. Offer one immediate chemotherapy instillation to patients with small papillary recurrences detected more than one year after previous TURB.StrongEAU risk group: HighOffer intravesical full-dose BCG instillations for one to three years but discuss immediate radical cystectomy (RC).StrongEAU risk group: Very HighOffer RC or intravesical full-dose BCG instillations for one to three years, particularly to those who decline or are unfit for RC.Strong Table 7.3: Treatment options for the various categories of BCG failure CategoryTreatment optionsBCG-unresponsive1.
