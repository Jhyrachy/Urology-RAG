6.2.2. Pathophysiology and risk factors. The aetiology of PE is relatively unknown, with limited data to support suggested biological and psychological hypotheses, including anxiety [533-536], penile hypersensitivity [537-544] and 5-hydroxytryptamine (HT) receptor dysfunction [545-550]. The classification of PE into four subtypes [201] has contributed to a better delineation of lifelong, acquired, variable and subjective PE [551-553]. It has been hypothesised that the pathophysiology of lifelong PE is mediated by a complex interplay of central and peripheral serotonergic, dopaminergic, oxytocinergic, endocrinological, genetic and epigenetic factors [554]. Acquired PE may occur due to psychological problems - such as sexual performance anxiety, and psychological or relationship problems and/or co-morbidity, including ED, prostatitis, hyperthyroidism and poor sleep quality [555-558]. Variable PE is considered to be a normal variation of sexual function whereas subjective PE can stem from cultural or abnormal psychological constructs [201]. A significant proportion of men with ED also experience PE [205,559]. High levels of performance anxiety related to ED may worsen PE, with a risk of misdiagnosing PE instead of the underlying ED. According to the National Health and Social Life Survey (NHSLS), the prevalence of PE is not affected by age [197], unlike ED, which increases with age. Premature ejaculation is not affected by marital or income status [197,560]. However, PE is more common in Black men, Hispanic men, and men from regions where an Islamic background is common [197,561,562] and the prevalence may be higher in men with a lower educational level [197,205]. Other reported risk factors for PE include genetic predisposition [550,563-566], poor overall health status and obesity [197], prostate inflammation [567-571], hyperthyroidism [555], low prolactin levels [572], high testosterone levels [573], vitamin D and B12 deficiency [574,575], diabetes [576,577], MetS [578,579], lack of physical activity [580], emotional problems and stress [197,581,582], depressive symptoms [582], and traumatic sexual experiences [197,205].
