4.3. Bladder Trauma. 4.3.1. Classification Bladder trauma is primarily classified according to the location of the injury: intraperitoneal, extraperitoneal, and combined intra-extraperitoneal [183], as it guides further management [184]. Bladder trauma is categorised by aetiology: non-iatrogenic (blunt and penetrating) and iatrogenic (external and internal). 4.3.2. Epidemiology, aetiology, and pathophysiology Road traffic accidents (Motor vehicle accidents) are the most common cause of blunt bladder injury, followed by falls and other accidents. The main mechanisms are pelvic crush and blows to the lower abdomen [129,183,185]. Most patients with blunt bladder injury have associated pelvic fractures (60-90%) and other intra-abdominal injuries (44-68.5%) [186,187]. Pelvic fractures are associated with bladder injury in about 3% of cases [129,188]; however, this can be as high as 26.5% in cases of severe pelvic injury [189]. Bladder injury is associated with urethral injury in 5-20% of cases [184,187,190]. The incidence of extraperitoneal (22.4-61.1%), and intraperitoneal (38.9-65.8%) injuries varies among series [191]. Extraperitoneal injury is almost always associated with pelvic fractures [185,187]. It is usually caused by distortion of the pelvic ring, with shearing of the anterolateral bladder wall near the bladder base (at its fascial attachments), or by a contrecoup at the opposite side. The highest risk of bladder injury was found in disruptions of the pelvic circle with displacement > 1 cm, diastasis of the pubic symphysis > 1 cm, and pubic rami fractures [129,184]. Occasionally, the bladder is directly perforated by a sharp bony fragment [184]. Intraperitoneal injury is caused by a sudden rise in intravesical pressure of a distended bladder, secondary to a blow to the pelvis or lower abdomen. The bladder dome is the weakest point of the bladder and ruptures usually occur there [184]. Penetrating injuries, mainly gunshot wounds, are rare except in conflict zones and violent urban areas [183,192,193]. Improvised explosive devices are the main cause of combat related bladder injuries in asymmetric warfare [194]. 4.3.2.1. Iatrogenic bladder trauma (IBT) The bladder is the urological organ that is most commonly affected by iatrogenic injury [195]. Table 4.3.1 shows the incidence of IBT during various procedures. External IBT occurs most often during obstetric and gynaecological procedures, followed by urological and general surgical operations [195]. Main risk factors are previous surgery, inflammation and malignancy [195]. Bladder perforations occur in up to 4.9% of mid-urethral sling operations for stress urinary incontinence in women. This rate is significantly lower in the obturator route compared to the retropubic route [196]. Internal IBT mainly occurs during transurethral resection of the bladder (TURB). Reported risk factors are larger tumours, older age, pre-treated bladders (previous TURB, intravesical instillations) and location at the bladder dome [197,198]. Tumours at the lateral wall pose a risk factor because of the obturator jerk [199,200]. Extraperitoneal perforations are more frequent than intraperitoneal perforations [198,201], and perforations requiring intervention are rare (0.16-0.57%) [197].

Diagnostic evaluation The principal sign of bladder injury is visible haematuria [184,185]. Absolute indications for bladder imaging include: visible haematuria and a pelvic fracture [184] or non-visible haematuria combined with high-risk pelvic fracture (disruption of the pelvic circle with displacement > 1 cm or diastasis of the pubic symphysis > 1 cm) or posterior urethral injury [184]. Bladder trauma should also be suspected in patients with blunt urethral trauma and high Injury Severity Score (ISS) [215]. In the absence of these absolute indications, further imaging is based on clinical signs and symptoms including [184,185,192,216]: inability to void or inadequate urine output;abdominal tenderness or distension due to urinary ascites, or signs of urinary ascites in abdominal imaging;uraemia and elevated creatinine level due to intraperitoneal re-absorption;entry/exit wounds at lower abdomen, perineum, or buttocks in penetrating injuries. Intra-operative signs of external iatrogenic bladder injury include: extravasation of urine, visible laceration, visible bladder catheter, and blood and/or gas in the urine bag during laparoscopy [204]. Direct inspection is the most reliable method of assessing bladder integrity [195]. Retrograde bladder filling (with or without instillation of dye e.g., methylene blue) helps to detect smaller lesions [217,218]. If bladder perforation is close to the trigone, the ureteric orifices should be inspected [195,204]. Internal bladder injury is recognised by cystoscopic identification of fatty tissue, dark space, or bowel [208]. It may also be detected by the inability to distend the bladder, low return of irrigation fluid, or abdominal distension [219]. Post-operatively, missed bladder trauma is diagnosed by haematuria, abdominal pain, abdominal distension, ileus, peritonitis, sepsis, urine leakage from the wound, decreased urinary output, or increased serum creatinine [195,204]. An IBT during hysterectomy or caesarean delivery can result in vesicovaginal or vesicouterine fistulae [204,220]. 4.3.3.1. Cystography Cystography is the preferred diagnostic modality for non-iatrogenic bladder injury and for a suspected IBT in the post-operative setting [220,221]. Both plain and CT cystography have a comparable sensitivity (90-95%) and specificity (100%) [185,222]. However, CT cystography is superior in the identification of bony fragments in the bladder and bladder neck injuries, as well as concomitant abdominal injuries [184,187]. Cystography must be performed using retrograde filling of the bladder with a minimum volume of 300-350 mL of dilute contrast material [221,223]. Passive bladder filling by clamping the urinary catheter during the excretory phase of CT or IVP is not sufficient to exclude bladder injury [185]. Intraperitoneal extravasation is visualised by free contrast medium in the abdomen outlining bowel loops or abdominal viscera [224]. Extraperitoneal bladder injury is typically diagnosed by flame-shaped areas of contrast extravasation in the peri-vesical soft tissues. Contrast medium in the vagina is a sign of vesicovaginal fistula [220]. 4.3.3.2. Cystoscopy Cystoscopy is the preferred method for detection of intra-operative bladder injuries as it may directly visualise the laceration and can localise the lesion in relation to the position of the trigone and ureteral orifices [224]. A lack of bladder distension during cystoscopy suggests a large perforation. Cystoscopy is recommended to detect perforation of the bladder (or urethra) following retropubic sub-urethral sling operations [196,214]. Routine intra-operative cystoscopy during other gynaecologic procedures is not recommended [225], although the threshold to perform it should be low in any suspected bladder injury. 4.3.4. Prevention The risk of bladder injury is reduced by emptying the bladder by urethral catheterisation in every procedure where the bladder is at risk [217,226]. Furthermore, the catheterâ€™s balloon can aid in identification of the bladder [217]. During TURB for tumours at the lateral wall, the incidence of internal IBT can be reduced by obturator nerve block or adequate muscle relaxation [200]. There is conflicting evidence whether bipolar TURB can reduce the risk for an obturator jerk [199,200]. The use of combat pelvic protection systems reduces the risk of bladder and other genitourinary injuries due to the blast mechanism of improvised explosivedevices [194,227]. 4.3.5. Disease management 4.3.5.1. Conservative management Conservative treatment, which comprises of clinical observation, continuous bladder drainage and antibiotic prophylaxis [198], is the standard treatment for an uncomplicated extraperitoneal injury due toblunt [184,187,190] or iatrogenic trauma [198]. Conservative treatment can also be chosen for uncomplicated intraperitoneal injury after TURB or other operations, but only in the absence of peritonitis and ileus [209,224]. Placement of an intraperitoneal drain is advocated, especially when the lesion is larger [219,228]. Penetrating extraperitoneal bladder injuries (only if minor and isolated) can also be managed conservatively [191,216,229]. 4.3.5.2. Surgical management Bladder closure is performed with absorbable sutures [191,195]. There is no evidence that two-layer is superior to watertight single-layer closure [187,191]. 4.3.5.2.1. Blunt non-iatrogenic trauma Most extraperitoneal ruptures can be treated conservatively; however, bladder neck involvement, bone fragments in the bladder wall, concomitant rectal or vaginal injury or entrapment of the bladder wall necessitate surgical intervention [184,230]. There is an increasing trend to treat pelvic ring fractures with open stabilisation and internal fixation with osteosynthesis material. During this procedure, an extraperitoneal rupture should be sutured concomitantly in order to reduce the risk of infection [231]. Likewise, an extraperitoneal rupture should be sutured during surgical exploration for other injuries, in order to decrease the risk of complications and to reduce recovery time [190]. In case of extraperitoneal injury with pelvic fractures treated by internal fixation, there is conflicting evidence about the need to repair the bladder in order to reduce the risk of infection [231,232]. Intraperitoneal ruptures should always be managed by surgical repair [184,187] because intraperitoneal urine extravasation can lead to peritonitis, intra-abdominal sepsis and death [186]. Abdominal organs should be inspected for possible associated injuries and urinomas must be drained if detected. Laparoscopic suturing of the intraperitoneal rupture is also possible [185]. 4.3.5.2.2. Penetrating non-iatrogenic trauma Penetrating bladder injury is managed by emergency exploration, debridement of devitalised bladder wall and primary bladder repair [192,193]. A midline exploratory cystotomy is advised to inspect the bladder wall and the distal ureters [191,192]. In gunshot wounds, there is a strong association with intestinal and rectal injuries, usually requiring faecal diversion [192,216]. Most gunshot wounds are associated with two transmural injuries (entry and exit wounds) and the bladder should be carefully checked for these two lesions [192]. As the penetrating agent (bullet, knife) is not sterile, antibiotic treatment is advised [193]. In selected patients (haemodynamically stable without associated injuries), penetrating well-contained extraperitoneal bladder injuries probably can be safely managed non-operatively [233]. 4.3.5.2.3. Iatrogenic bladder trauma Perforations lacerations intra-operatively are primarily closed [234]. Bladder injuries not recognised during surgery or internal IBT should be managed according to their location. The standard of care for intraperitoneal injuries is surgical exploration and repair [224]. If surgical exploration is performed after TURB, the bowel must be inspected to rule out concomitant injury [197]. For extraperitoneal injuries, exploration is only needed for perforations complicated by symptomatic extravesical collections. It requires drainage of the collection, with or without closure of the perforation [235]. If bladder perforation is encountered during mid-urethral sling or transvaginal mesh procedures, sling re-insertion and urethral catheterisation (two to seven days) should be performed [236]. 4.3.6. Follow-up Continuous bladder drainage is required to prevent elevated intravesical pressure and to allow the bladder to heal [195,237]. Conservatively treated bladder injuries (traumatic or external IBT) are followed up by cystography to rule out extravasation and ensure proper bladder healing [184]. The first cystography is planned approximately ten days after injury [191]. In case of ongoing leakage, cystoscopy should be performed to rule out bony fragments in the bladder, and a second cystography is warranted one week later [184]. After operative repair of a simple injury in a healthy patient, the catheter can be removed after five to ten days without cystography [237,238]. In cases of complex injury (trigone involvement, ureteric re-implantation) or risk factors of impaired wound healing (e.g., steroids, malnutrition) cystography is advised [191,237]. For conservatively treated internal IBT, catheter drainage, lasting five to seven days, is proposed [198,201]. 4.3.7. Summary of evidence and recommendations for bladder injury Summary of evidenceLEThe combination of pelvic fracture and visible haematuria is highly suggestive of bladder injury.3Cystography is the preferred diagnostic modality for non-iatrogenic bladder injury and for suspected IBT in the post-operative setting.3Cystography must be performed using retrograde filling of the bladder with a minimum volume of300-350 mL of dilute contrast material. Passive bladder filling by clamping the urinary catheter during the excretory phase of CT or IVP is not sufficient to exclude bladder injury.3The risk of bladder perforation during mid-urethral sling operations for stress urinary incontinence is lower for the obturator route compared to the retropubic route.1aConservative treatment, which comprises of clinical observation, continuous bladder drainage and antibiotic prophylaxis, is the standard treatment for an uncomplicated extraperitoneal injury due to blunt trauma.3In extraperitoneal bladder injury with either bladder neck involvement, bone fragments in the bladder wall, concomitant rectal or vaginal injury, or entrapment of the bladder wall, surgical intervention is necessary in order to decrease the risk of complications and to reduce recovery time.3Intraperitoneal bladder trauma is managed by surgical repair because intraperitoneal urine extravasation can lead to peritonitis, intra-abdominal sepsis, and death.3Conservative treatment is suitable for uncomplicated intraperitoneal injury during endo-urological procedures, in the absence of peritonitis and ileus.3In cases of complex injury (trigone involvement, ureteric re-implantation) or risk factors of impaired wound healing (e.g., steroids, malnutrition) cystography is advised after bladder repair.2a RecommendationsStrength ratingPerform cystography in the presence of visible haematuria and pelvic fracture.StrongPerform cystography in case of suspected iatrogenic bladder injury in the post-operative setting.StrongPerform cystography with active retrograde filling of the bladder with dilute contrast(300-350 mL).StrongPerform cystoscopy to rule out bladder injury during retropubic sub-urethral sling procedures.StrongManage uncomplicated blunt extraperitoneal bladder injuries conservatively.WeakManage blunt extraperitoneal bladder injuries operatively in cases of bladder neck involvement and/or associated injuries that require surgical intervention.StrongManage blunt intraperitoneal injuries by surgical exploration and repair.StrongManage small uncomplicated intraperitoneal bladder injuries during endoscopic procedures conservatively.WeakPerform cystography to assess bladder wall healing after repair of a complex injury or in case of risk factors for wound healing.Strong
