5.11. Endoscopic biopsies. 5.11.1. Bladder biopsies Carcinoma in situ can present as a velvet-like, reddish area, indistinguishable from inflammation, or it may not be visible at all. For this reason, biopsies from suspicious urothelium should be taken. In patients with positive urine cytology (see Section 5.5), and normal-looking mucosa at cystoscopy, mapping biopsies are recommended [175,176]. To obtain representative mapping of the bladder mucosa, biopsies should be taken from the trigone, bladder dome, right, left, anterior and posterior bladder wall [175,176]. If the equipment is available, photodynamic diagnosis (PDD) is a useful tool to target the biopsy (see section 5.12.1). 5.11.2. Prostatic urethral biopsies Involvement of the prostatic urethra and ducts in men with NMIBC has been reported. Palou et al., showed that in 128 men with T1G3 UC, the incidence of CIS in the prostatic urethra was 11.7% [177]. The risk of prostatic urethra or duct involvement is higher if the tumour is located at the trigone or bladder neck, in the presence of bladder CIS and multiple tumours [178]. Based on this observation, a biopsy from the prostatic urethra is necessary in some cases [177,179,180]. Biopsies should preferably be from the pre-collicular area (between 5 and 7 oâ€™clock position next to the veru montanum) using a resection loop.
