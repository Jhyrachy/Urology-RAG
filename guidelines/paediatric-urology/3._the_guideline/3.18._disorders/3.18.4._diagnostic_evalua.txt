3.18.4. Diagnostic evaluation. 3.18.4.1. The neonatal emergency The first step is to recognise the possibility of DSD (Table 5) and to refer the newborn baby immediately to a tertiary paediatric centre, fully equipped with neonatal, genetics, endocrinology and paediatric urology units. A diagnosis of a 46XX DSD as a result of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (the most common form of DSD) should not be delayed, and represents a neonatal emergency situation due to the possibility of salt loss which can be fatal.

Family history and clinical examination A careful family history must be taken followed by a thorough clinical examination including various laboratory tests and imaging modalities (Table 6).

A thorough and standardised clinical examination in a neonate presenting with ambiguous genitalia is important. In addition to an accurate description of the ambiguous genitalia, detailed information should be documented on the palpability and localisation of the gonads. Data gathered through the various examinations described below should help the team to come to a final diagnosis. Medical photography can be useful, however this requires sensitivity and consent [1264]. Palpable gonad: If it is possible to feel a gonad, it is most likely to be a testis; this clinical finding therefore virtually excludes 46XX DSD. Phallus: The phallus length, width, and glans width should be measured. A cotton bud placed at the suprapubic base of the implant of the stretched phallus allows for a good measurement of phallic length. Urogenital sinus opening: The opening of the urogenital sinus must be well evaluated. A single opening has to be identified as well as a hymenal ring. Attention needs to be paid to the fusion of the labioscrotal folds as well as whether they show rugae or some discolouration. Ultrasound can help to describe the palpated gonads or to detect non-palpable gonads [1260]. Mullerian structures like the vagina or utricular structures can be evaluated as well [1265,1266]. Genitography can provide some more information on the urogenital sinus, especially on the exact position of the confluence. Moreover, it gives evidence of possible duplication of the vagina. Invasive diagnostics under general anaesthesia can be helpful in some cases. During genito-cystoscopy, the urogenital sinus can be evaluated as well as the level of confluence. It allows also for evaluation of the vagina or utriculus, the possible presence of a cervix at the top of the vagina. Laparoscopy is necessary to obtain a final diagnosis on the presence of impalpable gonads and on the presence of Mullerian structures. If indicated, a gonadal biopsy can be performed [1267,1268]. Genetics has a increasing role in the diagnostic process of DSD. Karyotyping is usally at the beginning of the diagnostic process. Although next-generation sequencing-based molecular diagnostics and whole exome sequencing (WES) are becoming the gold standard for genetic evaluation, it may be difficult to prove variant causality or relate the genotype to the clinical presentation [1269]. These investigations will help to distinguish between various conditions of DSD, and provide a rapid diagnosis of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH).
