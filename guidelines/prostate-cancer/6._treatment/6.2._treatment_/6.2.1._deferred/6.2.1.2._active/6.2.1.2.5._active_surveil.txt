6.2.1.2.5. Active Surveillance - change in treatment. Men may remain on AS whilst they continue to consent, have a life expectancy of > ten years and the disease remains indolent. Patient anxiety about continued surveillance occurs in around 10% of patients on AS [524] and was recognised as a valid reason for active treatment [329]. An alternative for patients suitable for continuing AS would be to offer psychological support to reduce the level of anxiety [494]. A review on patient reported factor influencing the decision making, including thirteen qualitative papers and 426 men, identified a number of factors influencing the decision making when considering AS. Among the identified factors were personal risk assessment, influence of family and friends, beliefs about treatment as well as doctor and system factors, underscoring the importance of individualised, relevant, and clear information to support decision making [525]. A recent population-based cohort study from Sweden on regional differences in AS uptake and subsequent transition to radical treatment concluded that a regional tradition of a high uptake of AS was associated with a lower probability of transition to radical treatment, but not with AS failure [526]. These studies further emphasise the importance of thorough information and discussion with the patients on pros/cons of AS vs. active treatment already at the time of diagnosis for the patients to feel secure in their treatment choice and to avoid over-treatment. A PSA change alone, including PSA-doubling time (PSA-DT, < 3 years) should not change management based on its weak link with grade progression [527,528] but rather trigger further investigation. There was clear agreement in the DETECTIVE consensus meeting as well as in the Movember consensus group that a change in PSA should lead to repeat-MRI and repeat-biopsy. It was also agreed that changes on repeat MRI during AS needed a confirmatory biopsy before considering active treatment [330,494]. The histopathology criteria required to trigger a change in management in the targeted biopsy era remain debated. MRI-targeted biopsy induces a grade shift and ISUP grade group 2–3 cancers detected by MRI-targeted biopsy have, on average, a better prognosis than those detected by systematic sampling (see Section 5.2.4.2.6.4). As an increasing number of men with favourable intermediate-risk disease are managed with AS (see section 6.2.2.1), it seems illogical to use progression to ISUP grade group 2 based on targeted biopsies as the sole criterion for reclassification. In addition, as acknowledged in the DETECTIVE consensus meeting, the number of positive cores is not an indicator of tumour volume anymore if targeted biopsies are performed [330,529]. No agreement could be reached on the pathological criteria required to trigger a change in management during the DETECTIVE consensus meeting [330]. However, based on the findings of a SR incorporating 271 reclassification protocols, patients with low-volume ISUP grade group 2 disease at recruitment, and with increased systematic core positivity (> 3 cores involvement [> 50% per core]) on repeat systematic biopsies not using MRI, should be reclassified [491]. Furthermore, in a study from the MUSIC registry over half of men with favourable intermediate-risk prostate cancer on AS remained free of treatment five years after diagnosis [530]. Their results are in concordance with the DETECTIVE and the Movember consensus statements and indicate that most men on AS will not lose their window of cure and have similar short-term oncologic outcomes as men undergoing up-front treatment and that AS is an oncologically safe option for appropriately selected men with favourable intermediate-risk prostate cancer. The development of other comorbidities, resulting in a life expectancy of less than ten years should merit a new discussion with the patient and may result in a decision to transfer to a WW strategy.
