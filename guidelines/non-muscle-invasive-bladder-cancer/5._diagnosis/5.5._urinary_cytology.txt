5.5. Urinary cytology. The examination of voided urine or bladder-washing specimens for exfoliated cancer cells has high sensitivity in HG and G3 tumours (84%), but low sensitivity in LG/G1 tumours (16%) [99]. The sensitivity in CIS detection is 28â€“100% [100]. A recent report applying the Paris system found a sensitivity of 46% for HG disease [101]. Cytology is useful, particularly as an adjunct to cystoscopy, in patients with HG/G3 tumours; it is not designed to detect LG tumours. Positive voided urinary cytology can indicate an UC anywhere in the urinary tract; negative cytology, however, does not exclude its presence. Cytological interpretation is user-dependent [102,103] and evaluation can be hampered by low cellular yield, urinary tract infections, stones, or intravesical instillations: although in experienced hands specificity exceeds 90% [104]. Artificial intelligence algorithms combined with digital image processing (VisioCyt test) improved the sensitivity of cytology for HG tumours up to 92% [105]. A standardised reporting system known as The Paris System published in 2022 (2nd Edn.) redefined urinary cytology diagnostic categories as follows [106]: No adequate diagnosis possible (No diagnosis);Negative for UC (Negative);Atypical urothelial cells (Atypia);Suspicious for HG UC (Suspicious);High-grade/G3 UC (Malignant). The principle of the system and its terminology underlines the role of urinary cytology in detection of G3 and HG tumours. The Paris system for reporting urinary cytology has been validated in several retrospective studies [107,108]. Urine collection should respect the recommendation provided in Section 5.9. One cytospin slide from the sample is usually sufficient [106]. In patients with suspicious cytology repeat investigation is advised as the underlying risk of a high grade lesion is between 24-53% [109].
