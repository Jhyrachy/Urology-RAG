3.1. Definitions. In males, a urethral stricture refers to a narrowed segment of the anterior urethra due to a process of fibrosis and cicatrisation of the urethral mucosa and surrounding spongiosus tissue (“spongiofibrosis”) [11,12]. In the male posterior urethra, there is no spongiosus tissue and at this location the terms stenosis is preferred [11,12]. The definition of meatal stenosis is generally accepted as a short distal narrowing at the meatus, without involvement of the fossa navicularis [12]. There is no universal definition for what constitutes a female urethral stricture (FUS). Female urethral stricture is defined by most authors as a ‘fixed anatomical narrowing’ causing reduced urethral calibre [13,14]. This reduced urethral calibre is variously defined as between < 10 Fr to < 20 Fr [15,16] with the majority of series defining < 14 Fr as diagnostic, compared with a ‘normal’ urethral calibre of 18-30 Fr. In transgender patients, the term stricture is also used to define a narrowing of the reconstructed urethra despite the absence of surrounding spongious tissue.
