3.13.4.1. Early management with intermittent catheterisation. Starting intermittent catheterisation (IC) soon after birth and closure of the defect by the neurosurgeon in all infants has shown to decrease renal complications and the need for later augmentation [719-722]. In infants without any clear sign of outlet obstruction, this may be delayed but only in very selected cases. These infants should be monitored very closely for UTIs and changes of the urinary tract with US and UD. The early initiation of CIC in the new-born period makes it easier for caregivers to master the procedure and for children to accept it, as they grow older [723,724]. Up to 90% of patients will perform CIC [725]. A Cochrane review as well as a recent study showed, that there is a lack of evidence to state that the incidence of UTI is affected by use of sterile or clean technique, coated or uncoated catheters, single (sterile) or multiple use (clean) catheters, self-catheterisation or catheterisation by others, or by any other strategy [726-730]. Looking at the microbiological milieu of the catheter, there was a trend for reduced recovery of potentially pathogenic bacteria with the use of hydrophilic catheters. Also, a trend for a higher patient satisfaction with the use of hydrophilic catheters was seen [731]. Based on the current data, it is not possible to state that one catheter type, technique or strategy is better than any other.
