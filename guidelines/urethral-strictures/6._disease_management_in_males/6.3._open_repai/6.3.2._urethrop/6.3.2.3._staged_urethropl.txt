6.3.2.3. Staged urethroplasty for bulbar urethral strictures. 6.3.2.3.1. Indications Staged urethroplasty may be considered when: there are locally adverse conditions such as fistula, false passage, abscess, cancer [282,339,340];there has been a previously unsuccessful complex urethroplasty including failed hypospadias repair [257,339];there is a lack of certainty on behalf of the surgeon regarding the most appropriate form of urethroplasty for the patient [339];the stricture is radiotherapy induced [257];the stricture is consequent to LS [257] (this is controversial and for some groups LS is a contraindication for a staged urethroplasty [305]; Kozinn et al., recommend leaving at least ten months between 1st stage and 2nd stage re-tubularisation in patients with LS to allow graft complication to develop) [257];there is severe spongiofibrosis [341]. 6.3.2.3.2. Outcomes Patency rates of 33.3-94.6% at mean follow-up of 11.2-50 months have been described for staged urethroplasty in series which include men with bulbar urethral stricture disease [257,305,318,341-343]. Grafts (mesh graft, preputial skin, oral mucosa) can be used in staged augmentation as well as marsupialisation [318,341]. In patients affected by LS, a 52.2% patency rate for staged urethroplasty was reported whereas this was 86% for single-stage buccal mucosa urethroplasty (p < 0.01) [305]. It is highly likely that different stricture and patient characteristics contributed to the differences reported and this should be kept in mind when interpreting the data. Of note, 19-45.5% of patients planned for staged urethroplasty declined to proceed to 2nd stage re-tubularisation [257,342]. Early complications after staged procedures include wound dehiscence, UTI, epididymitis, scrotal abscess, and penile numbness. Specific to 2nd stage Johanson urethroplasty UCF occurs in 3-15%. The actual incidence of UCF is probably higher as many small fistulae close spontaneously with conservative management and are not formally reported [305,318,341]. Late complications of 1st stage urethroplasty include a need for revision in up to 19% - as a consequence of recurrence of LS in graft(s) (8.8%), graft contracture (6.6%) and stomal stenosis (3.3%) [257]. Late complications of 2nd stage urethroplasty include post-micturition dribble in 14-18%, SUI in up to 16%, penile curvature in up to 9%, ED in up to 4%, urethral diverticulum formation in 1% and cold glans [305,341,343]. Stress urinary incontinence, penile curvature and ED appear to be particularly associated with mesh graft stage urethroplasty [341,343]. After their procedure, 86% and 96.6% of men with, respectively, mesh graft and buccal mucosa graft staged urethroplasty were satisfied. The patient groups included in the review were too small to detect significant differences [341]. All are retrospective series – with heterogenous indications, stricture locations (not exclusively bulbar), stricture lengths and patient groups. It is consequently difficult to draw meaningful conclusions from the little data that are available. See supplementary Table S6.10 for more information. Summary of evidenceLEStaged urethroplasty for bulbar strictures and for strictures involving the bulbar urethra yields patency rates of 33.3-90% depending upon patient and stricture characteristics and patient satisfaction is high with all types of staged urethroplasty.3Lichen sclerosus is a relative contraindication for staged urethroplasty in the literature with lower long-term urethral patency rates of 52.2% compared to urethral patency rates of 64.3% in non-lichen sclerosis patients.3Up to 45.5% of men elect not to proceed to 2nd stage re-tubularisation after successful 1st stage.3Up to 19% of men required revision of their 1st stage urethroplasty.3 RecommendationsStrength ratingOffer staged urethroplasty to men with complex anterior urethral stricture disease not suitable for single stage urethroplasty and who are fit for reconstruction.WeakDo not perform staged bulbar urethroplasty for lichen sclerosis if single stage urethroplasty is possible.WeakConsider staged procedure in patients unsure about perineal urethrostomy versus urethral reconstruction.WeakWarn men that staged urethroplasty may comprise more than two stages.Weak 6.3.2.3.3. Risk factors There is a lot effort in identifying risk factors affecting the success rate of urethroplasties. The evidence is not clear about age, obesity, aetiology or prior radiation or prior surgery. The only clear risk factors in multivariate analysis are the length and the site of the stricture, success rates are better in shorter or bulbar strictures and worse in longer or penile strictures [317,344-346]. Patient should be informed about the higher risk in longer and penile strictures. 6.3.2.3.4. Risk factors for adverse outcomes In four series specifically dedicated to risk factors for failure after urethroplasty using multivariate analysis, there is conflicting evidence about several factors (aetiology, comorbidity, stricture length, prior therapy) that might be predictive for failure after urethroplasty (Table 6.6). Advanced age does not appear to be a risk factor for urethroplasty failure in the majority of studies, with the exception of Viers et al., 2017 [347] retrospective case series which found that the risk for recurrence was significantly higher beyond the age of 60 (< 50 yrs 94%,> 70 yrs 74%) in 184 patients having a wide variety of urethroplasties. Previous radiation therapy was also found to be a risk factor for stricture recurrence in both Viers’ [347] retrospective case series and Ahyai’s 2015 series [348] – with only a 71% patency rate at a median follow-up of 29 months in those with previous radiotherapy. Based on these data, a clear and evidence-based recommendation cannot be formulated.
