4.5.7.7. urethroplasty/urethral reconstruction. surgical reconstruction female urethra used management extensive urethral stricture. several urethroplasty techniques include use vaginal labial flaps, well vaginal buccal grafts cutting open fibrotic tissue causing urethral obstruction . use bladder flaps also reported , laboratory-engineered tissue grafts also used . surgical approaches described based position relative urethra; dorsal, ventral, circumferential. dorsal approach believed provide better mechanical support vascularised bed graft flap. however, greater risk damage sphincter clitoral bodies approach. ventral approach familiar surgeons requires less urethral mobilisation. however, reported prone urethrovaginal fistulae, although clear extent . reviews studies reporting outcomes urethroplasty state success rates 57–100% . pooled analysis six studies using vaginal labial flaps showed mean success rate 91% mean follow-up 32 months. vaginal labial graft urethroplasty reported 80% success rate mean follow-up 22 months. oral mucosal grafts, reported seven studies, mean success 94% mean follow-up fifteen months . later review studies dorsal buccal mucosal graft reported success rates 62–100%, pooled success rate 86% . long-term study mean follow-up 32 months showed stricture recurrence rate 23.1% .
