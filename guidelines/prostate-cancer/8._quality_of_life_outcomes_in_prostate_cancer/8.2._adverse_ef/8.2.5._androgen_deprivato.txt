8.2.5. Androgen deprivaton therapy. A summary of psychological impacts due to the use of ADT such as sexual function, mood, depression, cognitive function, and impact on partners can be found in two clinical reviews [1369,1370]. A small RCT evaluated the QoL at one-year follow-up in patients with PSA only relapse after primary therapy without evidence of metastasis, between various ADT regimens, or no treatment. Patients treated by ADT reported a significant decline in spatial reasoning, spatial abilities and working memory as well as increased depression, tension, anxiety, fatigue, and irritability during treatment [1371]. Conversely, a prospective observational study with follow-up out to three years failed to demonstrate any association with cognitive decline in men on ADT when compared to men with PCa not treated with ADT and healthy controls [1372]. A prospective observational study of locally advanced PCA or BCR after local therapy found that immediate ADT was associated with a lower overall QoL compared to deferred treatment [1373]. Another retrospective non-randomised study suggested that men receiving LHRH agonists reported more worry and physical discomfort and poorer overall health and were less likely to believe themselves free of cancer than patients undergoing orchiectomy. The stage at diagnosis had no effect on health outcomes [1374]. 8.2.5.1. Sexual function Cessation of sexual activity is very common in people undergoing ADT, affecting up to 93% [1375]. Androgen deprivation therapy reduces both libido and the ability to gain and maintain erections. The management of acquired ED is mostly non-specific [1376]. Using a specific non-validated questionnaire, bicalutamide monotherapy showed a significant advantage over castration in the domains of physical capacity and sexual interest (not sexual function) at twelve months [1377]. A post-hoc analysis, including only patients with sexual interest suggested that bicalutamide was associated with better sexual preservation, including maintained sexual interest, feeling sexually attractive [1378], preserved libido and erectile function [1379]. 8.2.5.2. Hot flushes Hot flushes are a common side effect of ADT (prevalence estimated between 44–80% of men on ADT) [1375]. They appear three months after starting ADT, usually persist long-term and have a significant impact on QoL. Serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (e.g., venlafaxine or sertraline) appear to be effective in men but less than hormone therapies based on a prospective RCT comparing venlafaxine, 75 mg daily, with medroxyprogesterone, 20 mg daily, or cyproterone acetate, 100 mg daily [1380]. After six months of LHRH (n = 919), 311 men had significant hot flushes and were randomised to one of the treatments. Based on median daily hot-flush score, venlafaxine was inferior -47.2% (interquartile range -74.3 to -2.5) compared to -94.5% (-100.0 to -74.5) in the cyproterone group, and -83.7% (-98.9 to -64.3) in the medroxyprogesterone group. Another RCT (n = 78) compared oestradiol (transdermal 0,9mg or 0,1% gel) to placebo. After six months oestradiol reduced daily hot flushes frequency (mean adjusted difference MAD -1,6, p=0.04) but the effect on weekly hot flushes was not significant (MAD -19,6 p=0.11) [1381]. With a placebo effect influencing up to 30% of patients [1382] , the efficacy of clonidine, veralipride, gabapentin [1383] and acupuncture [1384] need to be compared in prospective RCTs. 8.2.5.3. Non-metastatic bone fractures Due to increased bone turnover and decreased BMD in a time-dependent manner, ADT use is linked to an increased risk of fracture (up to 45% RR with long-term ADT) [1385]. Severe fractures in men are associated with a significant risk of death [1386]. A precise evaluation of BMD should be performed by DEXA, ideally before starting long-term ADT. An initial low BMD (T-score < -2.5 or < -1, with other risk factors) indicates a high risk of subsequent non-metastatic fracture and causes should be investigated. Other risk factors include increasing age, BMI of 19 or less, history of previous fracture or parent with fractured hip, current smoking, use of glucocorticoids, rheumatoid arthritis, alcohol consumption > two units per day, history of falls and a number of other chronic medical conditions [1387]. Fracture risk algorithms which combine BMD and clinical risk factors such as FRAX score can be used to guide treatment decisions, but uncertainty exists regarding the optimal intervention threshold, therefore no specific risk algorithm can be recommended for men on ADT for PCa. Obesity (increase in body fat mass by up to 10% and/or BMI > 30) and sarcopenia (decrease in lean tissue mass by up to 3%) as well as weight loss are common and occur during the first year of ADT [1388]. These changes increase the fracture risk [1389]. It is suggested that adding ARTA to ADT will increase this risk. This was also seen in a SR and meta-analysis [1390]. It was found that the use of ARTA was associated with an increase in fractures. Eleven studies were included with a total population of 11,382 men (median [range] age: 72 [43-97] years), with 6,536 in the ARTA group and 4,846 in the control group. Participants in the ARTA group could have received enzalutamide, apalutamide, or darolutamide in combination with androgen deprivation therapy or other enzalutamide combinations; patients in the control group could have received placebo, bicalutamide, or abiraterone. The incidence of fracture was 242 fractures (4%) in the ARTA group and 107 fractures (2%) in the control group. Use of an ARTA was associated with an increased risk of fractures: all-grade fracture (RR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.35-1.89; p <.001), and likely grade 3 or greater fracture (RR, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.12-2.63; p =.01). Bicalutamide monotherapy may have less impact on BMD but is limited by its suboptimal efficacy for M1 disease [1391,1392]. The intermittent LHRH-agonist modality might be associated with less bone impact [1393]. 8.2.5.4. Metabolic effects Lipid alterations are common and may occur as early as the first three months of treatment [1388]. Androgen deprivation therapy also decreases insulin sensitivity and increases fasting plasma insulin levels, which is a marker of insulin resistance. In diabetic patients, metformin appears to be an attractive option for protection against metabolic effects based on retrospective analysis [1394], but there is insufficient data to recommend its use in non-diabetic patients. Metabolic syndrome is an association of independent cardiovascular disease risk factors, often associated with insulin resistance. The definition requires at least three of the following criteria [1395]: waist circumference > 102 cm;serum triglyceride > 1.7 mmol/L;blood pressure > 130/80 mmHg or use of medication for hypertension;high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol < 1 mmol/L;glycaemia > 5.6 mmol/L or the use of medication for hyperglycaemia. The prevalence of a metabolic-like syndrome is higher during ADT compared with men not receiving ADT [1396]. Skeletal muscle mass heavily influences basal metabolic rate and is in turn heavily influenced by endocrine pathways [1397]. Androgen deprivation therapy-induced hypogonadism results in negative effects on skeletal muscle health. A prospective longitudinal study involving 252 men on ADT for a median of 20.4 months reported lean body mass decreases progressively over three years; 1.0% at one year, 2.1% at two years, and 2.4% at three years which appears more pronounced in men at ≥ 70 years of age [1398]. 8.2.5.5. Cardiovascular morbidity Cardiovascular mortality is a common cause of death in PCa patients [1030,1399,1400]. Several studies showed that ADT after only six months was associated with an increased risk of diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, and myocardial infarction [1401]. The RTOG 92-02 [1402] and 94-08 [1403] trials confirmed an increased cardiovascular risk, unrelated to the duration of ADT and not accompanied by an overall increased cardiovascular mortality. No increase in cardiovascular mortality has been reported in both a secondary analysis of PLCO trial, even among subgroups with pre-existing cardiovascular disease [1404] and a meta-analysis of trials RTOG 8531, 8610, 9202, EORTC 30891 and EORTC 22863 [1405]. However, serious concerns about the conclusions of this meta-analysis have been raised due to poor consideration of bias in the included studies [1406,1407]. A meta-analysis of observational data reports consistent links between ADT and the risk of cardiovascular disease patients treated for PCa, e.g., the associations between LHRH agonists and non-fatal or fatal myocardial infarction or stroke RR: 1.57 (95% CI: 1.26–1.94) and RR: 1.51 (95% CI: 1.24–1.84), respectively [1408]. In an updated meta-analysis on the cardiometabolic effects of ADT, ADT was not associated with metabolic syndrome RR: 1.60 (95% CI: 1.06-2.42), had a lower association with diabetes RR 1.43 (95% CI: 1.28-1.59) as previously reported, and an increased risk of hypertension by 30%, RR 1.30 (95% CI: 1.08-1.55). After adjustment for publication bias ADT was associated with a 25% increased risk for diabetes but was not associated with metabolic syndrome [1409]. An increase in cardiovascular mortality has been reported in patients suffering from previous congestive heart failure or myocardial infarction in a retrospective database analysis [1410] or presenting with a metabolic syndrome [1411]. It has been suggested that antagonists might be associated with less cardiovascular morbidity compared to agonists, but, as yet there is no definite evidence [1320,1412]. In a phase III RCT the use of relugolix, an oral LHRH antagonist, was associated with a reduced risk of major adverse cardiovascular events when compared to leuprolide, an injectable LHRH agonists, at 2.9% vs. 6.2%, respectively, over a follow-up time of 48 weeks (HR 0.46, 95% CI: 0.24–0.88) [1053]. Concerns about LHRH agonists resulted in an FDA warning and consensus paper from the American Heart, Cancer Society and Urological Associations [1029]. Preventive advice includes non-specific measures such as loss of weight, increased exercise, minimising alcohol intake, improved nutrition and smoking cessation [83,1413]. The adverse-effects of different ARTAs (abiraterone, apalutamide, darolutamide, enzalutamide) in the treatment of mCRPC, nmCRPC, and mHSPC were systematically reviewed in a multi-variate network meta-analysis. Here it is suggested that the ARTAs adverse effect profiles do not significantly differ from each other, except that enzalutamide was ranked the most toxic regarding hypertension in mCRPC and nmCRPC, and the most toxic regarding headache across all prostate cancer settings [1414]. 8.2.5.6. Fatigue Fatigue often develops as a side effect of ADT. Regular exercise appears to be the best protective measure. Reporting clinically significant fatigue is associated with severe psychological distress and should prompt screening for anxiety and/or depression [1415]. Anaemia may be a cause of fatigue [1375,1416]. Anaemia requires an aetiological diagnosis (medullar invasion, renal insufficiency, iron deficiency, chronic bleeding) and individualised treatment. Regular blood transfusions may be required in patients with severe anaemia. 8.2.5.7. Neurological side effects Castration seems also to be associated with an increased risk of stroke [1417], and is suspected to be associated with an increased risk for depression and cognitive decline such as Alzheimer disease [1418]. 8.2.5.8. Osteonecrosis during bisphosphonates or denosumab Bisphosphonates are synthetic pyrophosphate analogs and used in conditions such as malignancy and osteoporosis. Infrequent side effects associated with bisphosphonate use include pyrexia, renal function impairment, hypocalcemia, and avascular osteonecrosis of the jaw. Denosumab is a human monoclonal antibody that is used in the treatment of osteoporosis and bone metastasis [1419,1420]. It acts by inhibiting osteoclast activity, reducing bone resorption, and increasing bone density [1419]. Its highly specific mechanism of action is the inhibition of receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B ligand (RANKL). It has been shown to be effective at increasing bone mineral density and decreasing fractures in men with prostate cancer on ADT [1421]. Both drugs are associated with osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) According to the American Society of Bone and Mineral Research, ONJ is described as exposed bone in the maxillofacial region that does not heal within eight weeks of being identified by a healthcare provider in a patient that is currently or has been on bisphosphonates who does not have a history of radiation therapy in the craniofacial region [1422]. The incidence of ONJ is related to the dose and duration of treatment. The risk ranges from greater than 1% at twelve months to 11% after four years of treatment - taking zoledronic acid alone increases the risk of osteonecrosis to 21% after the third year. A SR on denosumab [1423] showed in a total of 8,963 patients with a variety of solid tumours in seven randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that the overall incidence of ONJ in patients with cancer receiving denosumab was 1.7% [95% CI: 0.9–3.1%]. The use of denosumab was associated with a significantly increased risk of ONJ in comparison with bisphosphonates (BPs)/placebo treatment (RR 1.61, 95% CI: 1.05–2.48, P = 0.029). Subgroup analysis based on controlled therapies demonstrated an increased risk of ONJ in denosumab therapy, when compared with BPs (RR 1.48, 95% CI: 0.96–2.29, p = 0.078) or placebo (RR 16.28, 95% CI: 1.68–158.05, p = 0.017). Similar results were observed for prostate cancer (RR 3.358, 95% CI: 1.573–7.166, p = 0.002). Denosumab combined with risk factors such as dental extraction, poor oral hygiene, use of removable apparatus, and chemotherapy may favour the development of ONJ. Therefore, before starting these drugs the patients should undergo a dental examination and maintain good oral hygiene.
