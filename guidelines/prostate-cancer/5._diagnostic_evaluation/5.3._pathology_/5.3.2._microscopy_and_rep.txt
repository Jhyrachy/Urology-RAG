5.3.2. Microscopy and reporting. Diagnosis of PCa is based on histology. The diagnostic criteria include features pathognomonic of cancer, major and minor features favouring cancer and features against cancer. Ancillary staining and additional (deeper) sections should be considered if a suspect lesion is identified [224]. Diagnostic uncertainty is resolved by intradepartmental or external consultation [224]. Sections 5.3.2.1 and 5.3.2.2 list the recommended terminology and item list for reporting prostate biopsies [223]. Type and subtype of PCa should be reported such as for instance acinar adenocarcinoma, ductal adenocarcinoma and small or large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma, even if representing a small proportion of the PCa. The distinct aggressive nature of small/large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma should be commented upon in the pathology report [223]. Apart from grading acinar and ductal adenocarcinoma, the percentage of Gleason grade 4 component should be reported in Gleason score 7 (3+4 and 4+3) PCa biopsies. Percentage Gleason grade 4 has additional prognostic value and is considered in some AS protocols [225,226]. Considerable evidence has been accumulated in recent years supporting that among the Gleason grade 4 patterns, cribriform pattern carries an increased risk of biochemical recurrence, metastatic disease and death of disease [227,228]. Reporting of this sub-pattern based on established criteria is recommended [101,229]. Intraductal carcinoma, defined as an extension of cancer cells into pre-existing prostatic ducts and acini, distending them, with preservation of basal cells [101], should be distinguished from high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) [230] as it conveys unfavourable prognosis in terms of biochemical recurrence and cancer-specific survival (CSS) [231,232]. Its presence should be reported whether occurring in isolation or associated with adenocarcinoma [101]. Some intra-epithelial lesions have architectural complexity and/or cytological atypia exceeding those of high-grade PIN but fall short for a definitive diagnosis of IDC. These lesions have been referred to as Atypical Intraductal Proliferation (AIP) and amongst others encompass lesions that were previously classified as cribriform high-grade PIN. Small retrospective series suggest that AIP at biopsy is associated with unsampled IDC [233,234]. Therefore, presence of AIP should be reported and commented on in non-malignant biopsies and biopsies with ISUP grade group 1 and 2 cancers in the absence of overt invasive cribriform and IDC. 5.3.2.1.

For MRI targeted biopsies consisting of multiple cores per target the aggregated (or composite) ISUP grade group should be reported per targeted lesion [101]. If the targeted biopsies are negative, presence of specific benign pathology should be mentioned, such as dense inflammation, fibromuscular hyperplasia or granulomatous inflammation [101,238]. A global ISUP grade group comprising all systematic (non-targeted) and targeted biopsies is also reported (see Section 4.2). The global ISUP grade group takes into account all biopsies positive for carcinoma, by estimating the total extent of each Gleason grade present. For instance, if three biopsy sites are entirely composed of Gleason grade 3 and one biopsy site of Gleason grade 4 only, the global ISUP grade group would be 2 (i.e. GS 7[3+4]) or 3 (i.e. GS 7[4+3]), dependent on whether the extent of Gleason grade 3 exceeds that of Gleason grade 4, whereas the worst grade would be ISUP grade group 4 (i.e. GS 8[4+4]). Neither global nor worst ISUP grade group is clearly superior over the other [239]. The majority of clinical studies have not specified whether global or worst biopsy grade was taken into account. In addition to GS /ISUP grade group, the presence/absence of intraductal/invasive cribriform pattern should be reported [101,236,237]. Furthermore, in biopsy GS 7 (ISUP grade group 2 and 3) percentage Gleason grade 4 should be monitored at the case and/or biopsy level [101,237]. Lymphovascular invasion (LVI), EPE and ejaculatory duct/seminal vesicle involvement must each be reported, if identified, since they carry unfavourable prognostic information [240,241]. Recently, a series of studies have demonstrated that computer-assisted PCa grading artificial intelligence algorithms can perform grading at the level of experienced genito-urinary pathologists. These algorithms have potential in supporting grading of less experienced pathologists, by reducing inter-observer variability, and in quantitative analyses. However, more extensive and prospective validation of these algorithms is needed for implementation in daily clinical practise [101,236,237,242]. The proportion of systematic (non-targeted) carcinoma-positive cores as well as the extent of tumour involvement per biopsy core correlate with the ISUP grade group, tumour volume, surgical margins and pathological stage in RP specimens and predict BCR, post-prostatectomy progression and RT failure. These parameters are included in nomograms created to predict pathological stage and SV invasion after RP and RT failure [243,244]. A pathology report should therefore provide both the number of carcinoma positive cores and the extent of cancer involvement for each core. The length in mm and percentage of carcinoma in the biopsy have equal prognostic impact [245]. An extent of >50% of adenocarcinoma in a single core is used as a cut-off in some AS protocols [246] triggering immediate treatment vs. AS in patients with ISUP grade group 1 (see Section 6.1.1.1). 5.3.2.2.
