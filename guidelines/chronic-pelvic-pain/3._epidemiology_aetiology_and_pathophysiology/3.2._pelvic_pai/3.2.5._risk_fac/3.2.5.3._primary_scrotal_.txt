3.2.5.3. Primary scrotal pain syndrome. Often scrotal pain is not associated with any specific pathology. Pain is perceived in the testes, epididymis, or the vas deferens. As the ilioinguinal, genitofemoral and the pudendal nerves intervate the scrotum [148], any pathology or intervention at the origin or along the course of these nerves may result in pain perceived in the scrotum [149]. Two special forms of scrotal pain syndrome can be described. The first is post-vasectomy scrotal pain syndrome which occurs following vasectomy. The mechanisms are poorly understood, and for that reason it is considered by some a special form of primary scrotal pain syndrome. Incidence of post-vasectomy pain is 2-20% among all men who have undergone a vasectomy. In men with post-vasectomy pain, 2-6% have a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score > 5 [150]. In a large cohort study of 625 men, the likelihood of scrotal pain after six months was 14.7%. The mean pain severity on a VAS score was 3.4/10. In the pain group, 0.9% had quite severe pain, noticeably affecting their daily life. In this cohort, different techniques were used to perform the vasectomy. The risk of post-vasectomy pain was significantly lower in the no-scalpel vasectomy group (11.7% vs. the scalpel group 18.8%) [151]. The second special form of scrotal pain is post-inguinal hernia repair pain. It is seen as a complication of hernia repair, but in trials it is seldom reported, or it is put under the term chronic pain (not specified). In studies that have explicitly mentioned scrotal pain, there was a difference in incidence between laparoscopic and open hernia repair. In almost all studies, the frequency of scrotal pain was significantly higher in the laparoscopic than in the open group [149,152]. In one particular study, there was no difference at one year but after five years, the open group had far fewer patients with scrotal pain [153]. Inguinal hernia repair can lead to chronic post-surgical pain (CPSP) in up to 10% of patients at six months [154] and may present with groin and/ or scrotal pain. Testicular injury is uncommon (< 1%) but if associated with pain, orchidectomy can lead to symptomatic relief in 2/3 of patients [155]. Careful identification and preservation of nerves has been found to be associated with a reduced risk of chronic pain.
