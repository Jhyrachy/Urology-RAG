5.15. Summary of evidence and guidelines for transurethral resection of the bladder, biopsies and pathology report. Summary of evidenceLETransurethral resection of the bladder tumour (TURB) followed by pathology investigation of the obtained specimen(s) is an essential step in the management of NMIBC.1The absence of detrusor muscle in the specimen is associated with a significantly higher risk of residual disease and tumour under-staging (with the exception of Ta LG/G1 tumours).2bA second TURB can detect residual tumours and tumour under-staging, increase recurrence-free survival, improve outcomes after BCG treatment and provide prognostic information.2Photodynamic diagnosis has been shown to improve the detection of bladder cancer, especially CIS.1a RecommendationsStrength ratingIn patients suspected of having bladder cancer, perform a transurethral resection of the bladder tumour (TURB) followed by pathology investigation of the obtained specimen(s) as a diagnostic procedure and initial treatment step.StrongPerform TURB systematically in individual steps:bimanual palpation under anaesthesia before starting the procedure and at the end;insertion of the resectoscope, under visual control with inspection of the whole urethra;inspection of the whole urothelial lining of the bladder;biopsy from the prostatic urethra (if indicated);cold-cup bladder biopsies (if indicated);resection of the tumour;recording of findings in the surgery report/record including visual impression of grade/stage;precise description of the specimen(s) for pathology evaluation.StrongPerformance of individual stepsPerform en-bloc resection or resection in fractions (exophytic part of the tumour, the underlying bladder wall and the edges of the resection area).StrongAvoid cauterisation as much as possible during TURB to avoid tissue deterioration.StrongTake biopsies from abnormal-looking urothelium.StrongTake multiple biopsies (mapping biopsies from the trigone, bladder dome, right, left, anterior and posterior bladder wall) or perform photodynamic diagnosis (PDD) guided biopsies, in case of normal looking urothelium and positive urine cytology.StrongTake a sample of the prostatic urethra if there is positive urine cytology without evidence of tumour in the bladder, or if abnormalities of the prostatic urethra are visible (see section 5.11.2).StrongTake a sample biopsy of the prostatic urethra in cases of bladder neck tumour, suspicion of bladder CIS and/or T1 disease. If a sample was not taken during the initial procedure, it should be performed at the time of second resection, if the latter is needed (see section 5.11.2).WeakUse methods to improve tumour visualisation (fluorescence cystoscopy, narrow-band imaging) during TURB, if available.WeakRefer the specimens from different biopsies and resection fractions to the pathologist in separately labelled containers. Submit the tumour base separately especially in large and multifocal tumours or when en-bloc resection is not feasible.WeakThe TURB record must describe tumour location, appearance, size and multifocality, all steps of the procedure, extent, macroscopic completeness of resection as well as any complications.StrongIn patients with positive cytology, but negative cystoscopy, exclude an upper tract urothelial carcinoma, CIS in the bladder (by mapping biopsies or PDD-guided biopsies) and tumour in the prostatic urethra (by prostatic urethra biopsy).StrongPerform a second TURB in the following situations:after incomplete initial TURB, or in case of doubt about completeness of a TURB;if there is no detrusor muscle in the specimen after initial resection, with the exception of Ta LG/G1 tumours and primary CIS;in T1 tumours.StrongIf indicated, perform a second TURB within 2â€“6 weeks after the initial resection. This second TURB should include resection of the primary tumour site.WeakRecord the pathology results of the second TURB as it reflects the quality of the initial resection.WeakInform the pathologist of prior treatments (intravesical therapy, radiotherapy, etc.).StrongThe pathological report should specify tumour location, tumour grade and stage, lymphovascular invasion, subtypes of urothelial carcinoma, presence of CIS and detrusor muscle.Strong
