5.3.2.3. Holmium laser enucleation of the prostate. Mechanism of action: The holmium:yttrium-aluminium garnet (Ho:YAG) laser (wavelength 2,140 nm) is a pulsed solid-state laser that is absorbed by water and water-containing tissues. Tissue coagulation and necrosis are limited to 3-4 mm, which is enough to obtain adequate haemostasis [396]. Efficacy: An initial meta-analyses reported no significant differences in short-term efficacy (Qmax) and re-intervention rates (4.3% vs. 8.8%) between HoLEP and M-TURP [397]; however, subsequent meta-analyses reported favourable short-term efficacy (Qmax and IPSS) for HoLEP [320,353,391,398]. Meta-analyses reported similar efficacy at 24-months in terms of IPSS, and Qmax [340]. Three meta-analyses evaluating HoLEP vs. B-TURP showed no significant differences in short-term efficacy (IPSS, QoL score and Qmax) [340,391,399]. One RCT comparing HoLEP with B-TURP in patients with prostate volume < 80 mL reported no significant difference in IPSS, QoL score and Qmax at 24-months [400]. One RCT comparing HoLEP with M-TURP in a small number of patients with mean prostate volume < 80 mL and a seven year follow-up found that the functional long-term results were comparable [396]. Another RCT comparing HoLEP with B-TURP in patients with prostate volume > 80 mL reported no significant difference in IPSS, QoL score and Qmax at 36 months, however, the overall re-treatment rate was significantly lower following HoLEP with less patients restarting Î±-blockers and less re-operations [401]. Comparative efficacy data for HoLEP vs. OP is presented in section 5.3.2.1. One RCT evaluating HoLEP vs. PKEP in patients with mean prostate volume < 80 mL reported similar improvements in IPSS and Qmax at twelve months follow-up [385]. In another RCT comparing HoLEP with PkEP improvements of IPSS, QoL, PVR, and Qmax were stable at 3-year follow-up without differences between the groups [402,403]. An RCT comparing HoLEP vs. bipolar transurethral enucleation reported no significant difference in IPSS, QoL score, PVR, and Qmax at one, three-, and twelve-months follow-up [404]. A SR and meta-analysis based on retrospective series, revealed a superior enucleation efficiency associated with en-bloc and the two-lobe techniques compared to the three-lobe technique, but no superiority on functional outcomes were reported [405]. Tolerability and safety: Several meta-analyses found that HoLEP has longer operation times, shorter catheterisation and hospitalisation times, reduced blood loss, fewer blood transfusions but no significant differences in urethral strictures (2.6% vs. 4.4%) and stress urinary incontinence (SUI) (1.5% vs. 1.5%) rates compared to M-TURP [353,391,397,398,406]. Another meta-analysis reported that HoLEP has shorter catheterisation times, fewer blood transfusions, urethral strictures and UTIs but no significant differences in clot retention rates and AUR after catheter removal compared to M-TURP [340]. Three meta-analyses evaluated HoLEP vs. B-TURP [391,399,407]. One, reported longer operation times for HoLEP, but no significant differences in hospitalisation time or complication rates [391] whilst another reported no significant differences in operation and catheterisation times or short-term complication rates [399]. Data from a large national database on peri-operative outcomes of 2,869 laser enucleation of the prostate and 37,577 TURP procedures supports that laser enucleation of the prostate is associated with longer operation times, shorter hospitalisation times, similar complication rates (including transfusions, and re-operations), but lower rates of infectious complications [408]. A SR reported that HoLEP has lower AUR rates after catheter removal but similar haemoglobin drop, UTI, urethral stricture, and UI rates [340]. An RCT comparing HoLEP with B-TURP in patients with prostate volume < 80 mL reported longer operation time, shorter catheterisation and hospitalisation times and a lower risk for haemorrhage for HoLEP with no significant differences in blood transfusion rates or other complication rates at 24 months [400]. Another RCT comparing HoLEP with B-TURP in patients with prostate volume > 80 mL reported shorter operation, catheterisation and hospitalisation times and lower blood transfusion rates for HoLEP but no differences in complication rates including UI and IIEF-5 score at 36 months [401] Comparative data on safety of HoLEP vs. OP are presented in section 5.3.2.1. One RCT evaluating HoLEP vs. PKEP in patients with mean prostate volume < 80 mL reported significantly shorter operation times for HoLEP, but similar catheterisation and hospitalisation times and complication rates at twelve months follow-up [385]. Another RCT comparing HoLEP with PkEP found a higher haemoglobin drop and a prolonged haematuria in the PkEP group but no clinical significant blood loss in either arm occurred [402,403]. An RCT comparing HoLEP vs. bipolar B-TUEP demonstrated shorter operation and hospitalisation times and earlier catheter removal for HoLEP [404]. Another RCT comparing high (2J, 50 Hz) with medium power (2J, 30 Hz) HoLEP demonstrated comparable peri-operative safety and long-term durability [409]. A double-blind RCT of pulse modulation use in HoLEP (Virtual basket) demonstrated statistically significantly outcomes related to haemostasis (18 vs. 29 min, p < 0.01) and operation time (101 vs. 126 min, p < 0.01), when compared to conventional HoLEP [410]. This was confirmed in a SR and meta-analysis of seven studies comparing pulse modulation use with standard HoLEP. Shorter enucleation, better haemostasis and shorter total surgical time was found with pulse modulating HoLEP [411]. One RCT evaluating tranexamic acid use in HoLEP surgery did not find any difference with regard to bleeding complications and peri-operative safety [412]. Holmium laser enucleation of the prostate has been safely performed in patients using anticoagulant and/or antiplatelet medications. However, current limitations include: a lack of RCTs; limited data on short- and mid-term complications and bridging therapy; data presentation does not allow for separate interpretation of either antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy [413]. A meta-analysis of seven RCTs evaluating HoLEP vs. TURP reported that short- and mid-term IIEF-5 scores were comparable, whilst long-term scores were significantly better for HoLEP [414]. Two other meta-analyses detected no difference in mid-term retrograde ejaculation rates [415]. The impact on erectile function is comparable [416,417] however the conclusion that retrograde ejaculation is also comparable between HoLEP and TURP is highly dependent on the use template [416,417]. Erectile function did not decrease from baseline in either group; three quarters of sexually active patients had retrograde ejaculation after HoLEP. Data have shown that ejaculation and orgasm perception are the two most impacted domains after HoLEP [418]. Attempts to maintain ejaculatory function with HoLEP have been reported to be successful in up to 46.2% of patients [419]. An RCT comparing HoLEP vs. B-TUEP, reported shorter operation and hospitalisation times and earlier catheter removal for HoLEP [404]. Practical considerations: The experience of the surgeon is the most important factor affecting the overall occurrence of complications in HoLEP [420,421]. Mentorship programmes are advised to improve surgical performance from both an institutional and personal learning curve perspective [422-424]. Pulse modulation use in HoLEP (Virtual basket) demonstrated statistically significantly outcomes related to haemostasis and operation times, clinical and health economic benefits remains to be determined.
