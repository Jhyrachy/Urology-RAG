4.9.4. disease management. women minimal symptoms would prefer avoid invasive treatment, conservative management considered. patients warned small risk cancer (1–6%) within diverticulum . 4.9.4.1. surgical treatment rcts investigated effectiveness surgery women bothersome urethral diverticulum. thorough evaluation anatomy diverticulum essential planning reconstructive surgery. three surgical approaches treatment diverticulum: marsupialisation, endoscopic incision, curative treatment diverticulectomy. surgical removal (diverticulectomy) commonly reported treatment contemporary case series. principles successful transvaginal diverticulectomy to: dissect well-vascularised vaginal flap; preserve peri-urethral fascia closure; remove diverticular wall; excise ostium close urethra watertight fashion; close incision multi-layered fashion overlapping suture lines; preservation creation continence. decision use labial fat pad flap (commonly known martius flap) varies, flap used frequently following situations: recurrent cases, large urethral defects deficient vaginal flaps closure transection urethra required access circumferential diverticulum case complex configuration , planned future sling procedure required ui facilitate dissection time . marsupialisation involves incision mass vaginal side drain infected contents. wall sutured open absorbable suture allow drainage prevent reaccumulating infectious materials. approach leaves cystic structure place theoretically cause urethro-vaginal fistula communication diverticular ostium, rapid procedure little dissection required. approach advocated pregnant patients decompress diverticulum allow safe vaginal delivery. small case series suggested 75% pregnant women urethral diverticula managed expectantly eventually required postpartum surgery . endoscopic incision rarely reported treatment option . procedure involves finding narrow neck ostium incising resectoscope. unroofing diverticulum transforms narrow communication urethra causes symptoms becomes obstructed wide-mouthed sac drains freely. 4.9.4.2. management concomitant stress urinary incontinence many women present concomitant sui urethral diverticulum may request conditions simultaneously treated. meta-analysis reported diverticulectomy cured sui even without concomitant anti-incontinence procedure. however, data regarding symptom severity given could assumed many cured patients less-severe ui surgery . therefore, additional surgical correction may required . however, consensus appropriate timing surgical management two conditions. thus, patients symptomatic bothersome sui association urethral diverticulum may offered simultaneous anti-ui surgery. although historical series shown good results concomitant bladder neck suspension , contemporary series utilised pubovaginal fascial slings, satisfactory outcomes [772-775]. synthetic mus recommended concomitant anti-ui procedure time urethral diverticulectomy . synthetic material adjacent fresh suture line following diverticulectomy setting potentially infected urine may place patient higher risk subsequent urethral erosion vaginal extrusion sling material, well urethro-vaginal fistula formation foreign body granuloma formation. 4.9.4.3. success rate complications transvaginal urethral diverticulectomy high success rate (defined dry) 84–98%, reoperation rate 2–13% primary repair mean follow-up twelve 50 months . resolution symptoms surgery reported reach 68.8% less half studies comment symptom improvement . one case series reported recurrence rate 33% u-shaped 60% circumferential diverticula within one year , one study found 10.7% recurrence rate 122 women undergoing diverticulectomy, higher risk recurrence proximal multiple diverticula previous pelvic surgery radiation. recurrent urethral diverticulum following initial successful urethral diverticulectomy may occur result new infection traumatic insult childbirth, new urethral diverticulum, recurrence original lesion. recurrence may due incomplete removal urethral diverticulum, inadequate closure urethra, residual dead space (circumferential diverticula), technical factors. repeat urethral diverticulectomy represents unique challenge due altered anatomy, scarring, difficulty identifying proper anatomical planes. one case series reported storage symptoms decreased significantly postoperatively 60% 16% following surgery urethral diverticulum . series long-term follow-up, however, demonstrated rates postoperative urgency 54% , de novo uui 36% patients . postoperative symptoms indicate persistence urethral diverticulum, recurrence urethral diverticulum, de novo oab syndrome urethral obstruction. stress urinary incontinence worsened occur de novo diverticulectomy. likely due sphincteric damage dissection scarification preventing urethral closure. de novo sui (10.6% women) seems common proximal large (> 30 mm) diverticula . however, retrospective review noted least de novo sui 49% patients following urethral diverticulectomy; minor require additional therapy . 10% individuals underwent subsequent sui surgery. treatment sui diverticulectomy well described literature. commonly reported operation autologous pubovaginal sling followed retropubic suspension . however, two reported cases synthetic mesh sling treat sui, without mesh complications , controversial. early common postoperative complications include uti (0–39%), de novo sui (3.8–33%), de novo urinary retention (0–9%), especially setting concomitant placement autologous pubovaginal sling . delayed complications urethral stricture reported 0–5.2% cases . urethro-vaginal fistula devastating complication presenting 0.9–8.3% cases . distal fistula located beyond sphincteric mechanism present split urinary stream vaginal voiding may require repair. however, fistula located anywhere mid-urethra bladder neck may result ui. patients undergo repair consideration adjuvant tissue flap, martius flap, aid closure. timing fistula repair well defined, delay three six months initial repair good balance patient discomfort optimal tissue quality. rare complications include: distal urethral necrosis, bladder injury, urethral injury, ureteric injury, vaginal scarring narrowing consequent dyspareunia . 4.9.4.4. pathological findings urethral diverticula lined squamous cells, urothelium columnar epithelium . meta-analysis, high prevalence chronic acute inflammation (68.6%) commonly reported lesions nephrogenic metaplasia, occurred 8% cases. diverticula may undergo neoplastic alterations (6%), including invasive adenocarcinoma , followed squamous cell carcinoma 0.7%. unknown diverticulum forms first transforms malignancy malignancy develops first. malignancies treated similar fashion urethral cancer women.
