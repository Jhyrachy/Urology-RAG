7.3.8. Survival. Of all cancers, bladder cancer ranks 13th in terms of mortality, with rates decreasing particularly in the most developed countries [407]. Disease-free survival and OS in a large population-based study was 35% and 58% at ten years, respectively [408]. However, the 5-year OS in node-positive patients who underwent cystectomy was 18% [409]. A systematic review including 57 studies (n = 30,293) assessed the long-term survical of patients treated with trimodality therapy (TMT) and RC [408]. Ten-year OS was 30.9% and 35.1%, for TMT and RC, respectively with a mean DSS of 50.9% for TMT and 57.8% for RC. For T2 disease, 10-year DSS was 69% and 78.9% for TMT and RC, respectively and for T3/T4 disease 43.5% and 43.1% for TMT and RC, respectively. Three percent of the patients (812 of 27,867) received NAC, resulting in 5-year OS and DSS in downstaged patients (â‰¤ pT1) at RC of 75.7% and 88.3%, respectively.
