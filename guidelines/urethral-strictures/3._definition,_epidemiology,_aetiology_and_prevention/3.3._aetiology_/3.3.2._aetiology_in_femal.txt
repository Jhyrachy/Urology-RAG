3.3.2. Aetiology in females. The cause of FUS was idiopathic in 48.5%, iatrogenic in 24.1%, resulting from prior urethral dilations, difficult/traumatic catheterisation with subsequent fibrosis, urethral surgeries (mainly diverticulum surgery, fistula repair and anti-incontinence procedures) and trauma (mainly following pelvic fracture) in 16.4% [125-137]. Radiation therapy and infections are rare causes of FUS [138]. The most common segment of urethra affected is the midor mid-to-distal (58%). Panurethral strictures are rare (4%) [15,125,127,128,130-132,137,139]. For further information see online supplementary Tables S3.1 and S3.2.
