3.10.2. classification systems. five widely used classification systems according to; site, severity, episode, symptoms complicating factors. acute treatment, site severity important. 3.10.2.1. classification according site lower urinary tract infection (cystitis) inflammatory condition urinary bladder mucosa general signs symptoms including infection, dysuria, frequency, urgency, malodorous urine, enuresis, haematuria, suprapubic pain. upper urinary tract infection (pyelonephritis) diffuse pyogenic infection renal pelvis parenchyma. onset pyelonephritis generally abrupt. clinical signs symptoms include fever (> 38°c), chills, costovertebral angle flank pain, tenderness. 3.10.2.2. classification according severity lower uti, children may mild pyrexia; able take fluids oral medication; slightly dehydrated; good expected level compliance. low level compliance expected, children managed severe uti. severe uti, infection related presence fever > 39°c, feeling ill, persistent vomiting, moderate severe dehydration. severe utis upper urinary tract infections. 3.10.2.3. classification according episode first/persistent/recurrent/breakthrough first uti may sign anatomical anomalies. anatomical evaluation recommended (see below). recurrent infection divided unresolved persistent infection. unresolved infection, initial therapy inadequate elimination bacterial growth urinary tract (inadequate therapy, inadequate antimicrobial urinary concentration [poor renal concentration/ gastrointestinal malabsorption], infection involving multiple organisms differing antimicrobial susceptibilities). persistent infection caused re-emergence bacteria site within urinary tract coming nidus persistent infection cannot eradicated (e.g. infected stones, non-functioning poorly functioning kidneys/renal segments, ureteral stumps nephrectomy, necrotic papillae, urachal cyst, urethral diverticulum, peri-urethral gland, vesicointestinal, rectourethral vesicovaginal fistulas). pathogen identified recurrent infections, episodes sterile urine may occur shortly following antimicrobial treatment. breakthough infection patients antibacterial prophylaxis usually caused resistent bacteria, parental non-compliance and/or severe urogenital anomalies . re-infection, episode caused variety new infecting organisms, contrast bacterial persistence infecting organism always isolated. however, common general pathogenic species e. coli, occurs many different serotypes. therefore, recurrent e. coli uti equate infection organism. 3.10.2.4. classification according symptoms children may typical atypical symptoms regarding uti. neonates infants commen symptoms fever, vomiting, lethargy and/or irritability. infants children may non-specific signs poor appetite, failure thrive, lethargy, irritability, vomiting diarrhoea. toilet trained children may report cystitis symptoms along fever/flank pain. asymptomatic bacteriuria indicates attenuation uropathogenic bacteria host, colonisation bladder non-virulent bacteria incapable activating symptomatic response (no leukocyturia, symptoms). asymptomatic uti includes leukocyturia symptoms. symptomatic uti, includes irritative voiding symptoms, suprapubic pain (cystitis), fever malaise (pyelonephritis). cystitis may represent early recognition infection destined become pyelonephritis, bacterial growth controlled balance virulence host response. 3.10.2.5. classification according complicating factors uncomplicated uti, infection occurs patient morphologically functionally normal upper lower urinary tract, normal renal function competent immune system. category includes mostly isolated recurrent bacterial cystitis usually associated narrow spectrum infecting pathogens easily eradicated short course oral antimicrobial agents. patients managed outpatient basis, emphasis documenting resolution bacteriuria, followed elective evaluation potential anatomical functional abnormalities urinary tract . complicated uti occurs children known mechanical functional pathology urinary tract. mechanical obstruction commonly due presence posterior urethral valves, strictures stones, independent location. functional obstruction often results lower urinary tract dysfunction (lutd) either neurogenic non-neurogenic origin dilating vur. patients complicated uti require hospitalisation parenteral antibiotics. prompt anatomical evaluation urinary tract critical exclude presence significant abnormalities . mechanical functional abnormalities present, adequate drainage infected urinary tract necessary.
