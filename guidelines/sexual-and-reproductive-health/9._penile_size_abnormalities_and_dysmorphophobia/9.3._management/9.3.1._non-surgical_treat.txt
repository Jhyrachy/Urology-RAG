9.3.1. Non-surgical Treatments. 9.3.1.1. Psychotherapy Penile augmentation is often motivated by the desire to improve self-perception and self-esteem [1257]. Cosmetic treatments may help increase individuals’ well-being and QoL, improving self-esteem and emotional states [1123,1124,1138]. Still, psychotherapy is recommended when psychopathological comorbidities are detected, or when aversive relationship dynamics may underly the request for penile augmentation. Addressing patients’ and partners’ motivations and expectations regarding penile augmentation seems to be a key psychotherapeutic target while no other empirical evidence is described. Similarly, men with BDD and SPA present a significant discrepancy between the perceived and ideal size of the penis, internalising the belief they should have a larger penis [1258]. Cognitive behaviour therapy for BDD could be applied to cases of anxiety regarding penis size, although no clinical trials have been reported [1259]. In all, it is worth noting that psychotherapy should normalise the great variability of genital shape and size [1133]. Managing patient expectations could be a means to improve results and well-being associated with the surgery process. 9.3.1.2. Penile traction therapy Despite the various surgical techniques, there are also non-invasive methods that are used to enhance penile length, including penile traction therapy (PTT) [1260]. In a pilot phase-II prospective study that evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of a penile-extender device in the treatment of short penis, Gontero et al., used the same traction device for at least 4 hours/day for 6 months and achieved a significant gain in length, of +2.3 and +1.7 cm for the flaccid and stretched penis, respectively (both p < 0.001) [1261]. However, the change in the penile girth was not significant. In a further prospective study, these results were confirmed by Nikoobakht et al., who found a significant improvement in the mean length both for the flaccid (8.8 ± 1.2 cm to 10.5 ± 1.2 cm, P < 0.05) and the stretched state (11.5 ± 1.0 cm to 13.2 ± 1.4 cm, p < 0.05) following 3 months of use of a penile traction device [1262]. At six-month follow-up, compared to baseline, a mean gain of +1.7 ± 0.8, +1.3 ± 0.4, and +1.2 ± 0.4 cm was reported for the flaccid, stretched, and erect penile lengths, respectively (p < 0.001, for all). The broad spectrum of available PTT studies is summarised in Table 26. Overall, PTT seems effective in lengthening the penis both in the flaccid and stretched state with minimal side effects. Yet it is not effective for penile girth enhancement. However, the quality of evidence is poor due to the lack of RCTs, and the availability of only heterogeneous and small PTT cohorts has also been proven effective in the restoration of length or correction of deformities due to several diseases, including PD, or post-RP conditions [955,1263-1265].

Vacuum erection device Vacuum erection devises (VED) are generally considered for patients who fail oral ED therapies [413,1237]. In contrast, data regarding the use of VEDs on penile elongation is scarce. In a study with 27 men whose SPL was < 10 cm, the use of a VED three times a week for 20 minutes on each occasion, for six months, did not result in a significant increase in flaccid or SPL [1267]. On the other hand, the benefits of using a VED following PPI and RP have been demonstrated in the literature [1267-1272]. 9.3.1.4. Endocrinological therapies Testosterone administration has been used for a long time to increase the length of the penis in infant or pre-pubertal boys with micropenis. Topical administration of T or DHT has also been proposed by other authors with reported better outcomes with DHT, especially in poor responders to T or in those with type 2 alpha reductase deficiency [1273,1274]. Finally, the possible use of the combination of hCG and FSH treatment has also been proposed with positive outcomes [1275,1276]. Despite the treatment suggested it should be recognised that no face-to-face comparisons are available so far. 9.3.1.5. Summary of evidence and recommendations for the non-surgical management of short penile size Summary of evidenceLEPsychotherapy should not be undertaken in the realm of preventing individuals’ legitimate choice to improve their lives.
