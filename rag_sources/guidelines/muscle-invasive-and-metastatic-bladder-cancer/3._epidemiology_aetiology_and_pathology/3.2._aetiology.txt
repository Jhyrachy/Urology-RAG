3.2. aetiology. 3.2.1. tobacco smoking tobacco smoking well-established risk factor bc, causing 50–65% male cases 20–30% female cases . causal relationship established exposure tobacco cancer studies chance, bias confounding discounted reasonable confidence . incidence bc directly related duration smoking number cigarettes smoked per day . meta-analysis looked 216 observational studies cigarette smoking cancer published 1961 2003, pooled risk estimates bc demonstrated significant association current former smokers . recently, increase risk estimates current smokers relative never smokers described suggesting could due changes cigarette composition . starting smoke younger age increased risk death bc . immediate decrease risk bc observed stopped smoking. reduction 40% within one four years quitting smoking 60% 25 years cessation . meta-analysis nine studies, distinguishing mibc nmibc, suggested smokers decide quit diagnostic work-up upon bladder cancer diagnosis better prognosis continue smoke . nethertheless, encouraging people stop smoking would result incidence bc decreasing equally men women . 3.2.2. occupational exposure chemicals occupational exposure second-most important risk factor bc. work-related cases accounted 20–25% bc cases several series likely occur occupations dyes (with exception hair dyes ), rubbers, textiles, paints, leathers, chemicals used . risk bc due occupational exposure carcinogenic aromatic amines significantly greater ten years exposure; mean latency period usually exceeds 30 years . population-based studies established occupational attribution bc men 7.1%, attribution discernible women . 3.2.3. radiotherapy increased rates secondary bladder malignancies reported external-beam radiotherapy (ebrt) gynaecological malignancies, relative risks (rr) 2–4 . population-based cohort study, standardised incidence ratios bc developing radical prostatectomy (rp), ebrt, brachytherapy, ebrt-brachytherapy 0.99, 1.42, 1.10, 1.39, respectively, comparison general u.s. population . recently proposed patients received radiotherapy (rt) prostate cancer modern modalities intensity-modulated rt (imrt) may lower rates in-field bladder- rectal secondary malignancies . nevertheless, since longer follow-up data yet available, bc requires long period develop, patients treated radiation long life expectancy higher risk developing bc . 3.2.4. dietary factors several dietary factors related bc; however, links remain controversial. european prospective investigation cancer nutrition (epic) study on-going multicentre cohort study designed examine association diet, lifestyle, environmental factors cancer. found links bc fluid intake, red meat, vegetable fruit consumption recently inverse association dietary intake flavonoids lignans risk aggressive bc tumours described . 3.2.5. metabolic disorders large prospective study pooling six cohorts norway, sweden, austria (the metabolic syndrome cancer project, me-can 2.0), metabolic aberrations, especially elevated blood pressure triglycerides, associated increased risks bc among men, whereas high body mass index (bmi) associated decreased bc risk. associations bmi, blood pressure bc risk significantly differed men women . association diabetes mellitus (dm) risk bc evaluated numerous meta-analyses inconsistent results. analysing specific subpopulations, dm associated bc csm risk especially men . thiazolidinediones (pioglitazone rosiglitazone) oral hypoglycaemic drugs used management type 2 dm. use association bc still matter debate. recent meta-analysis observational studies summary results indicated pioglitazone use significantly associated increased risk bc appears linked higher dose longer duration treatment . u.s. food drug administration (fda) recommend healthcare professionals prescribe pioglitazone patients active bc . several countries europe removed agent market included warnings prescription. moreover, benefits glycaemic control vs. unknown risks cancer recurrence pioglitazone considered patients prior history bc. 3.2.6. bladder schistosomiasis chronic urinary tract infection bladder schistosomiasis (bilharzia) second common parasitic infection malaria, 600 million people exposed infection africa, asia, south america, caribbean . well- established relationship schistosomiasis urothelial carcinoma (uc) bladder, progress squamous cell carcinoma (scc), however, better control disease decreasing incidence scc bladder endemic zones egypt . similarly, invasive scc linked presence chronic urinary tract infection (uti) distinct schistosomiasis. direct association bc utis observed several case- control studies, reported two-fold increased risk bc patients recurrent utis series . however, recent meta-analysis found statistical association pooling data recent highest quality studies highlights need better quality data able draw conclusions . similarly, urinary calculi chronic irritation inflammation urothelium described possible risk factors bc. meta-analysis case-control cohort studies suggests positive association history urinary calculi bc . 3.2.7. gender although men likely develop bc women, women present advanced disease worse survival rates. meta-analysis including nearly 28,000 patients shows female gender associated worse survival outcome (hazard ratio [hr]: 1.20, 95% ci: 1.09–1.32) compared male gender radical cystectomy (rc) . finding already presented descriptive nationwide analysis based 27,773 austrian patients. analysis authors found cancer-specific survival (css) identical pt1-tumours sexes, women worse css age cohorts (< 70 years ≥ 70 years) higher tumour stages . however, treatment patterns unlikely explain differences overall survival (os) . population-based study ontario cancer registry analysing patients bc treated cystectomy radical rt 1994 2008, differences os, mortality outcomes found males females following radical therapy . gender-specific difference survival patients bc also analysed norwegian population. survival inferior female patients within first two years diagnosis. discrepancy partly attributed severe t-stage female patients initial diagnoses . population-based study marketscan databases suggests possible reason worse survival female population may women experienced longer delays diagnosis men, differential diagnosis women includes diseases prevalent bc . furthermore, differences gender prevalence bc may due factors besides tobacco chemical exposure. large prospective cohort study, post-menopausal status associated increase bc risk, even adjustment smoking status. finding suggests differences oestrogen androgen levels men women may responsible difference gender prevalence bc [45-47]. moreover, recent population study assessing impact hormones bc suggests younger age menopause (≤ 45 years) associated increased risk bc . 3.2.8. genetic factors growing evidence genetic susceptibility factors family association may influence incidence bc. recent population-based study cancer risk relatives spouses uc patients showed increased risk first- second-degree relatives, suggests genetic environmental roots independent smoking-related behaviour . shared environmental exposure recognised potentially confounding factor . recent studies detected genetic susceptibility independent loci, associated bc risk . genome-wide association studies (gwas) bc identified several susceptibility loci associated bc risk. 3.2.9. summary evidence guidelines epidemiology risk factors summary evidenceleworldwide, bladder
