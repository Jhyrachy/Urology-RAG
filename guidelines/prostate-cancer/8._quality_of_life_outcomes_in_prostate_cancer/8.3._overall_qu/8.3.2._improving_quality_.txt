8.3.2. Improving quality of life in men who have been diagnosed with PCa. 8.3.2.1. Men undergoing local treatments In men with localised disease, nurse-led multi-disciplinary rehabilitation (addressing sexual functioning, cancer worry, relationship issues, depression, managing bowel and urinary function problems) provided positive short-term effects (four months) on sexual function (effect size 0.45) and long-term (twelve months) positive effects on sexual limitation (effect size 0.5) and cancer worry (effect size 0.51) [1450]. Exercise programs during RT combined with ADT result in consistent benefits for cardiovascular fitness (standardised mean difference [SMD], 0.83; 95% CI: 0.31–1.36; p < 0.01) and muscle function (SMD, 1.30; 95% CI: 0.53–2.07; p < 0.01) with a reduction in urinary toxicity (SMD, -0.71; 95% CI: -1.25 to -0.18; p < 0.01) [1451]. In men undergoing AS, twelve weeks of high-intensity interval training may improve cardiovascular fitness and suppress PSA progression [1452]. In men with post-surgical urinary incontinence, conservative management options include pelvic floor muscle training with or without biofeedback, electrical stimulation, extra-corporeal magnetic innervation (ExMI), compression devices (penile clamps), lifestyle changes, or a combination of methods. Uncertainty around the effectiveness and value of these conservative interventions remains [1453]. Surgical interventions including sling and artificial urinary sphincter (AUS) significantly decrease the number of pads used per day and increase the QoL compared with before intervention. The overall cure rate is around 60% and results in improvement in incontinence by about 25% [1454]. Other alternatives, such as the Adjustable Transobturator Male System (ATOMS) and the Adjustable Continence Therapy (proACT) may be an option but seems less efficacious than AUS [1455]. For a more detailed overview of management of urinary incontinence in these men see Chapter 5.6 in the EAU Guidelines for Management of Non-neurogenic Male LUTS [1456]. The use of PDE5 inhibitors in penile rehabilitation has been subject to some debate. A single-centre, double-blind RCT of 100 men undergoing nerve-sparing surgery reported no benefit of nightly sildenafil (50 mg) compared to on-demand use [1457]. However, a multi-centre double-blind RCT (n = 423) in men aged < 68 years, with normal pre-treatment erectile function undergoing either open, conventional or robot-assisted laparoscopic nerve-sparing RP, tadalafil (5 mg) once per day improved participants EPIC sexual domain-scores (least squares mean difference +9.6, 95% CI: 3.1–16.0) when compared to 20 mg ‘on demand’ or placebo at nine months of follow-up, even though the difference vanished after the end of study [1458]. Therefore, based on discordant results, no clear recommendation is possible, even if a trend exists for early use of PDE5 inhibitors after RP for penile rehabilitation [1459]. A detailed discussion can be found in the EAU Sexual and Reproductive Health Guidelines [1460]. In a SR of genitourinary cancers with mostly prostate cancers it is evident that sexual well-being concerns for men and their partners are evident from diagnosis and into survivorship. Both (patient and partners) benefited from interventions but many articulated difficulties with initiating the topic due to embarrassment and limited access to interventions in cancer services [1461]. Testosterone Regarding supplementation of testosterone there seems to be some hesitation by HCP. Although the evidence is limited, men who are managed expectantly for PCa, or who received radical local therapy, do not have worse outcomes when receiving testosterone supplementation [77]. We therefore advise to not hesitate to give testosterone substitution to symptomatic hypogonadal men with prostate cancer where ADT is not the treatment of choice. 8.3.2.2. Men undergoing systemic treatments Similar to men treated with a radical approach (see above), in men with T1-T3 disease undergoing RT and ADT, a combined nurse-led psychological support and physiotherapist-led multi-disciplinary rehabilitation has reported improvements in QoL. Specifically, this intervention involved action planning around patients’ needs related to lifestyle changes, weight control, toilet habits, sexuality, and psychological problems. This was complemented with pelvic floor muscle therapy. Improvements in urinary (adjusted mean 4.5, 95% CI: 0.6–8.4), irritative (adjusted mean 5.8, 95% CI: 1.4–10.3) and hormonal (adjusted mean 4.8, 95% CI: 0.8–8.8) EPIC domains were found up to 22 weeks of follow-up [1462]. In a three-year follow-up with 92% response rate from the initial study, fewer participants had moderate-severe bowel problems in the intervention (n = 2; 3%) vs. control group (n = 10; 14%) (p = 0.016) but the benefits in terms of urinary function were maintained only in those participants with moderate-severe urinary problems at baseline [1463]. Providing supervised aerobic and resistance exercise training of a moderate intensity improves EORTC QLQ-C30 role (adjusted mean 15.8, 95% CI: 6.6–24.9) and cognitive domain outcomes (adjusted mean 11.4, 95% CI: 3.3–19.6) as well as symptom scales for fatigue (adjusted mean 11.0, 95% CI: 20.2–1.7), nausea (adjusted mean 4.0, 95% CI: 7.4–0.25), and dyspnoea (adjusted mean 12.4, 95% CI: 22.5–2.3) up to three months in men treated with ADT [1464]. Such interventions have also reported clinically relevant improvements in FACT-P (mean difference 8.9, 95% CI: 3.7–14.2) in men on long-term ADT [1465,1466]. These findings are supported by a SR which reported improvements up to twelve weeks in cancer-specific QoL in a meta-analysis of high-quality trials (SMD 0.33, 95%, CI: 0.08–0.58) [1416]. Supervised exercise interventions delivered over twelve months are effective in reducing psychological distress; particularly in those men with highest levels of baseline anxiety and depression [1467]. In untrained older men, SR suggests lower volume exercise programs at moderate-to-high intensity are as effective as higher volume resistance training for enhancing body composition, functional capacity and muscle strength and may reduce barriers to exercise and enhance adherence [1468]. Another SR and meta-analysis of randomised trials shows that exercise interventions for patients on ADT result in higher lean body mass (mean difference: 0.88, 95% CI 0.4 to 1.36, p < 0.01), a lower body fat mass (mean difference: -0.93, 95% CI: -1.10 to -0.10, p < 0.05), and a lower body fat rate (mean difference:-0.93, 95% CI: -1.39 to -0.47, p < 0.01). Greater efficacy was noted for exercise duration of ≥ six months (vs. < six months) and exercise immediately after starting ADT (vs. delayed exercise) [1469]. A SR and meta-analysis in patients with prostate cancer undergoing ADT, on supervised exercise therapy vs. no therapy shows that supervised exercise therapy is probably superior to no exercise therapy in improving ‘disease-specific quality of life’ 0.43 (95%CI: 0.29, 0.58) and ‘walking performance’ −0.41 (95% CI: −0.60, −0.22) with a moderate certainty of evidence [1470]. A SR and meta-analysis on determining the factors that affect adherence to exercise programs, found that exercise had no effects (p < 0.05) on quality of life and fatigue. For aerobic fitness, and upper- and lower-body strength significant effects (all p < 0.05) were observed. Adherence to exercise-based interventions was 80.38%, with improvements observed in aerobic fitness and strength. Subgroup analysis revealed exercise adherence impacted fatigue and strength, with greater improvements observed in programs > twelve weeks [1471]. If dietary intake is not adequate, vitamin D and calcium supplementation should be offered, as there is evidence that vitamin D and calcium have modest effects on bone in men on ADT [1457]. Online tools are available to calculate daily calcium intake for individual patients. For vitamin D deficiency a dose of at least 800 IU/day colecalciferol can be recommended. Use of a 25(OH) assay may be helpful to measure vitamin D levels [1472,1473]. Anti-resorptive therapy is recommended for men on ADT for > six months with either a BMD T-score of < -2.5 or with an additional risk factor for osteoporosis or annual bone loss confirmed to exceed 5%, or in cases of severe fracture. Referral to a bone specialist should be considered in complex cases with severe fracture and/or multiple risk factors. Alendronate, risedronate, zoledronate and denosumab have all been shown to prevent bone loss in men with hormone-sensitive locally-advanced and metastatic PCa on ADT [1474-1477]. Patients should be warned about the < 5% risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw and/or atypical femoral fractures associated with these drugs. Bisphosphonates increase BMD in the hip and spine by up to 7% in one year [1476,1478]. The optimal regimen for zoledronic acid for men on ADT with hormone-sensitive locally-advanced and metastatic PCa remains unclear: quarterly [1479] or yearly [1480] injections. The question is relevant as the risk of jaw necrosis is both dose- and time-related [1481]. A quarterly regimen should be considered for a BMD ≤ 2.5 as a yearly injection is unlikely to provide sufficient protection [1482,1483]. Care should be taken when discontinuing treatment as rebound increased bone resorption can occur. In M0 patients, denosumab has been shown to increase the lumbar BMD by 5.6% compared to a 1% decrease in the placebo arm after two years, using 60 mg subcutaneous regimen every six months [1421]. This was associated with a significant decrease in vertebral fracture risk (1.5% vs. 3.9%, p = 0.006). The benefits were similar whatever the age (< or > 70 years), the duration or type of ADT, the initial BMD, the patient’s weight, or the initial BMI. This benefit was not associated with any significant toxicity, e.g., jaw osteonecrosis or delayed healing in vertebral fractures. In M0 patients, with the use of a higher dosage (120 mg every four weeks), a delay in bone metastases of 4.2 months has been shown [1280] without any impact on OS, but with an increase in side effects. Therefore, this later regimen cannot be recommended. In the SPARTAN phase III study (apalutamide in nmCRPC) [1267], patients receiving apalutamide experienced falls more frequently vs. those receiving placebo (15.6% vs. 9.0%). In the final multivariable model, the baseline patient characteristics of older age, poor ECOG, history of neuropathy, and α-blocker use before study treatment, remained significantly associated with fall. After-baseline clinical characteristics significantly associated with time to fall were development of neuropathy, arthralgia, and weight loss before fall. Preventive interventions should be considered when the identified baseline conditions and post-treatment neuropathy, arthralgia, or weight decrease are present, to reduce risk of fall. 8.3.2.3. Decision regret Several treatments with curative intent for localised PCa are available all with comparable ten-year OS [489]. They vary in terms of the incidence of major side effects, including urinary symptoms, bowel symptoms and compromised sexual functioning [1364,1365,1484]. For this reason, patients’ treatment preferences, in which they weigh expected benefits against likely side effects, are a central consideration in shared decision-making and in making informed treatment decisions [1485-1487]. It remains challenging, however, to evaluate whether the decision-making process can be viewed as successful; that is, whether the choice of treatment best reflects the patient’s preferences and expectations [1488,1489]. According to Decision Justification Theory (DJT), it is the more specific information on which treatment experiences lead to regret that decision regret needs to be better understood and to minimise it in future patients [1490]. About 25% of men with PCa undergoing either single or combined modality treatments report experiencing worse side effects than expected [1491]. Urinary incontinence most strongly correlates with regret after prostatectomy [1492]. Unmet expectations are comparable among the treatment groups, except for fatigue. Fatigue is less frequently reported as worse than expected by patients who received BT when compared to patients who received RP or EBRT. This could be explained by the less invasive treatment course of BT in comparison to EBRT with or without ADT and RP [1493]. Unmet expectations were more frequently reported by patients with positive surgical margins following surgery; having had a passive role in the decision-making process; and who had higher scores on the decisional conflict scale (i.e., more uncertainty about the treatment decision). Interestingly, positive surgical margins are not directly associated with an increased risk of PC-related mortality [960]. Active participation and support in the process of forming a preference increases the chance of choosing a treatment that is in line with patients’ expectations [1487,1494-1496]. While it may seem desirable to tailor the patients’ role in decision-making to their initial preference, and particularly to a preference for deferring to the advice of the clinician, this does not result in less decisional conflict or regret. Increasing patients’ knowledge regardless of initial preference may actually be preferable [1492]. 8.3.2.4. Decision aids in prostate cancer Shared decision-making can increase patients’ comfort when confronted with management decisions but has been shown to improve health outcome [1497] and more training seems needed for health care professionals guiding patients [1498]. Patient education decreased PSA testing [1499] and increased adherence to AS protocols [1500,1501]. Autonomous active decision-making by patients was associated with less regret after prostatectomy regardless of the method chosen and decision aids reduce decisional conflict [1502]. Still, guidance is needed to optimise patients’ understanding of the options [1503]. Patients prioritised effectiveness and pain control over mode of administration and risk of fatigue when confronted with treatment choice in metastasised PCa [1504]. When implementing decision aids clinical validity and utility should be carefully evaluated and distinguished [1505]. A decision aid should educate as well as promote shared decision-making to optimise efficacy [1506] and pay attention to communicative aspects [1507]. 8.3.2.5.
