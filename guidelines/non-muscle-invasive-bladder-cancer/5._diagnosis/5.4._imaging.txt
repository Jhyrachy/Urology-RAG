5.4. Imaging. 5.4.1. Computed tomography urography and intravenous urography Computed tomography (CT) urography is used to detect papillary tumours in the urinary tract, indicated by filling defects and/or hydronephrosis [89]. Intravenous urography (IVU) is an alternative if CT is not available [90], but CT urography provides more information particularly in muscle-invasive tumours of the bladder and in UTUCs (including status of lymph nodes and neighbouring organs). The necessity to perform a baseline CT urography once a bladder tumour has been detected is questionable due to the low incidence of significant findings which can be obtained [91-93]. The incidence of UTUCs is low (1.8%), but increases to 7.5% in tumours located in the trigone [92]. The risk of UTUC during follow-up increases in patients with multiple and high-risk tumours [94]. 5.4.2. Ultrasound Ultrasound (US) may be performed as an adjunct to physical examination as it has moderate sensitivity to a wide range of abnormalities in the upper- and lower urinary tract. It permits characterisation of renal masses, detection of hydronephrosis, and visualisation of intraluminal masses in the bladder, but cannot rule out all potential causes of haematuria [95,96]. It cannot reliably exclude the presence of UTUC and cannot replace CT urography. 5.4.3. Multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging The role of multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) has not yet been established in BC diagnosis and staging. A standardised methodology of MRI reporting (Vesical Imaging-Reporting and Data System [VI-RADS]) in patients with BC has recently been published and requires further validation [97]. A systematic review of 8 studies showed that the VI-RADS scoring system can accurately differentiate NMIBC from MIBC with high inter-observer agreement rates [98]. A diagnosis of CIS cannot be made with imaging methods alone (CT urography, IVU, US or MRI).
