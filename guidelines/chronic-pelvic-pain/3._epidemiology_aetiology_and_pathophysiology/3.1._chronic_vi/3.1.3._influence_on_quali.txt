3.1.3. Influence on Quality of Life. Assessing QoL in pelvic pain patients is challenging due to the complex pathology, the multi-faceted nature of the complaints and the overlap between the different pelvic pain syndromes. Pelvic pain syndromes have an impact in terms of QoL [24,25], depression, anxiety, impaired emotional functioning, insomnia and fatigue [24,26]. If these aspects are identified and targeted early in the diagnostic process, the associated pain symptoms may also improve. Addressing comorbidities will help in further improving QoL. Quality of life assessment is therefore important in patients with pelvic pain and should include physical, psychosocial behavioural and emotional aspects, using standardised instruments where possible. Chronic pain is, in many countries, the leading cause of years lost to disability [21], although these figures are dominated by musculoskeletal pain and headache. Chronic pain is often associated with depression and other psychological problems; with loss or reduction of work and of ability to carry out domestic tasks; and, with substantial use of healthcare, often with disappointing outcomes.
