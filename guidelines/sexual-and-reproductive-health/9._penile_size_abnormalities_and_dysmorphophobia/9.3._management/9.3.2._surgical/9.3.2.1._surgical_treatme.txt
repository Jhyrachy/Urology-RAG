9.3.2.1. Surgical treatment of adult acquired buried penis. 9.3.2.1.1. Adult acquired buried penis surgical procedures classification According to the classification proposed by Pariser et al. different procedures may range from low complexity (including un-burying of penile shaft, reconstruction of penile shaft with the use of skin flaps or grafts, plastic surgical techniques to reconstruct the scrotum) to high complexity [including surgical removal of the suprapubic fat pad (escutcheonectomy) and operations to skin and subcutaneous fat layers of the abdominal wall (apronectomy] [1191]. The purpose of any surgical approach is to unbury the penile shaft, reconstruct genital teguments and eventually remove peri-genital or excess abdominal tissue in order to reduce the risk of recurrence. The goal is to balance an effective surgical procedure aiming to improve patient QoL, while minimising the incidence of postoperative complications. Lifestyle changes and risk factors modification, particularly weight loss, are widely considered as a proactive approach to minimise AABP surgical complications and should be encouraged before surgical intervention is undertaken. The broad spectrum of surgical interventions described to manage AABP is summarised in Table 27.
