3.1.7.2. Haemorrhage. Haematomas are usually a minor complication in renal transplantation. Their incidence is reported to be between 0.2-25% [178,179]. Small and asymptomatic haematomas do not usually require any intervention. In case of larger haematomas, clinical signs and symptoms due to external pressure with graft dysfunction and/or thrombotic graft vessel complications can be present. These cases may be treated by percutaneous drainage under computed tomography (CT) or ultrasound (US) guidance or may require surgical treatment [178].
