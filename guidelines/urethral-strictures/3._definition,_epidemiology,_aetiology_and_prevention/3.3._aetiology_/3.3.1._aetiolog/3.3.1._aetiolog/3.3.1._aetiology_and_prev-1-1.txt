er monopolar TURP [89]. Meanwhile, Tao et al., found total prostate volume (< 46.2 g) (OR: 1.5), but not resected gland weight, to be an independent risk factor [84]. d.2.2 Incidence of urethral stricture and bladder neck stenosis with different energy modalities A SR and meta-analysis by Cornu et al., showed no significant differences in urethral stricture and BNS rates by energy modality (monopolar, bipolar, holmium laser enucleation, photoselective vaporisation) [76]. In another meta-analysis assessing outcomes of thulium (Tm:Yag) laser and bipolar TURP, no difference in urethral stricture and BNS rates were found between the two modalities [90]. The presence of potentially confounding factors such as endoscopic sheath diameter, energy setting used, procedural length and length of follow-up make inter-study comparisons between energy modalities problematic. Overall, there is no strong evidence that any single modality is associated with a clinically significant higher incidence of urethral stricture and BNS than others. Selection of modality should be based on a comprehensive evaluation of clinical safety and efficacy. A summary of incidences of urethral stricture and BNS with different modalities is presented in Table 3.1. A systematic review analysing different techniques used for BPH surgery, showed the lowest incidence of urethral strictures in enucleation procedures, followed by B-TURP and ablation, and M-TURP. However, after twelve months of follow-up there were no significant differences in stricture rate [91].

At twelve months follow-up a urethral stricture was found in 17% and 0% of cases in the placebo and rofecoxib groups, respectively (p=0.0039) [92]. Chung et al., conducted a single blinded RCT (n=180) evaluating the effect of urethral instillation of hyaluronic acid (HA) and carboxymethylcellulose (CMC). Urethral stricture on urethrography was diagnosed in 1.25% and 8.64% of patients in the treatment and placebo group respectively (p=0.031). Further RCTs are needed to confirm these findings and the safety of the pharmacological interventions. Several earlier comparative studies assessed whether routine preliminary urethrotomy with an Otis urethrotome prevented the incidence of stricture following TURP [93-96]. Only one of these reported at least twelve month follow-up, finding no significant difference in stricture rate in patients undergoing TURP alone vs. Otis urethrotomy followed by TURP (21% vs. 14%) [97]. Others have suggested performing internal urethrotomy where there are pre-existent meatal or urethral strictures [98]. Adjunctive transurethral incision of the prostate (TUIP) at the end of TURP to reduce the rates of BNS was studied by Lee et al. [89]. A total of 1,135 patients of whom 667 underwent TURP and 468 underwent TURP plus TUIP were retrospectively studied. At median follow-up of 38 months, the incidence of BNS was 12.3% for the TURP group vs. 6.0% for the TURP plus TUIP group (p < 0.001). In glands < 30 g, the incidence of BNS in the TURP vs. the TURP plus TUIP group was 19.3% and 7.7%, respectively (p < 0.05). The clinical efficacy and safety of additional surgical interventions to prevent urethral stricture and BNS need to be confirmed in larger prospective RCTs before their use can be recommended. Summary of evidenceLEAn RCT with more than twelve months follow-up failed to demonstrate a significant reduction in stricture rate using routine urethrotomy prior to TURP.1b RecommendationStrength ratingDo not routinely perform urethrotomy when there is no pre-existent urethral stricture.Strong d.3 Radical prostatectomy Radical prostatectomy has been associated with vesico-urethral anastomosis stricture (VUAS) in 0.5-30% of patients [77], though most modern series report it in the range of 1-3% [99]. The risk of stricture formation after salvage RP is notably higher (22-40%) [100]. Most VUAS develop within the first two years [100,101]. A 2012 meta-analysis by Tewari et al., showed no significant difference in VUAS between open-, laparoscopic and robotic RP [102]. In contrast, a more recent analysis of a national cohort in the UK found that VUAS rate after robotic RP was 3.3%, which is significantly lower than following laparoscopic (5.7%) or open RP (6.9%) [103]. These findings are consistent with an earlier similar study conducted in the USA [104]. The difference in VUAS rates may be explained by the level of experience and surgical volume of surgeons [105].
