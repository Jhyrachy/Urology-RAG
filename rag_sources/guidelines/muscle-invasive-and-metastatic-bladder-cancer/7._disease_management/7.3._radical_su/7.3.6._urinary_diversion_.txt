advantages disadvantages terms qol, sexual function, urinary continence body image different urinary diversions , research evaluating impact tumour stage, functional- socio-economic status needed. 7.3.6.1. different types urinary diversion choice urinary diversion, comorbidity, cardiac, pulmonary cognitive function important factors considered, along patient’s social support preference (see section patient selection/comorbidities). age > 80 years often considered threshold neobladder reconstruction recommended. however, exact age strict contraindication . randomised controlled trials comparing conduit diversion neobladder continent cutaneous diversion performed. 7.3.6.1.1. uretero-cutaneostomy ureteral diversion abdominal wall simplest form cutaneous diversion. operating time, complication rate, blood loss, transfusion rate, stay intensive care length hospital stay lower patients treated ureterocutaneostomy compared ileal conduit . frail patients and/or solitary kidney need supravesical diversion, uretero-cutaneostomy preferred procedure. case patients kidneys need uretero-cutaneostomy, either one ureter, shorter one attached end-to-side, connected skin (trans-uretero-cutaneostomy) ureters may directly anastomosed abdominal wall creating stoma. due smaller diameter ureters, stoma stenosis ascending utis observed frequently technique compared using small large bowel create intestinal stoma . 7.3.6.1.2. ileal conduit ileal conduit established option well-known/predictable results. early complications (30-day cut off, used publications) include utis, pyelonephritis, ureteroileal leakage stenosis occur 48% patients . 7.3.6.1.3. orthotopic neobladder according dutch-, german- spanish bladder cancer registry data, orthotopic bladder substitution urethra used approximately 10–20% male female patients. emptying reservoir anastomosed urethra requires abdominal straining, sphincter relaxation. terminal ileum gi segment often used orthotopic bladder substitution. early late morbidity 22% patients reported . various forms uut reflux protection, including simple isoperistaltic tunnel, ileal intussusception, tapered ileal prolongation implanted subserosally, direct (sub)mucosal subserosal ureteral implantation, described . according long-term results, uut protected sufficiently either method . study comparing cancer control patterns disease recurrence patients neobladder ileal conduit showed difference css two groups adjusting pathological stage . urethral recurrence neobladder patients seems rare (0.8–13.7% [pooled estimate 4.6% male female patients, also considering significantly higher recurrence rates male patients]) . results indicate neobladder male female patients compromise oncological outcome cystectomy. 7.3.6.1.4. continent cutaneous urinary diversion continent cutaneous urinary diversion (a low-pressure detubularised ileal reservoir self-catheterisation) uretero-rectosigmoidostomy rarely

patient selection ensuring patients make well-informed decision type urinary diversion associated less decision regret post-operatively, independent method selected . therefore, applicable forms urinary diversion discussed, taking account patient preference, comorbidities, age tumour characteristics. diagnosis invasive urethral tumour prior cystectomy leads urethrectomy contraindication

oncological results orthotopic neobladder illial conduit similar terms local distant metastasis recurrence, secondary urethral tumours seem less common patients neobladder compared conduits continent cutaneous diversions . patients undergoing continent urinary diversion must motivated learn diversion manually skilful able deal diversion. contraindications continent urinary diversions include: debilitating neurological psychiatric illnesses;limited life expectancy;severe impaired liver renal function. relative contraindications orthotopic neobladder high-dose pre-operative rt, complex urethral strictures severe urethral sphincter-related incontinence . retrospective study including 1,383 patients showed risk decline estimated glomerular filtration rate (egfr) significantly differ ileal conduit vs. neobladder patients pre- operative chronic kidney disease 2 (egfr 60–89 ml/min/1.73 m2) 3a (egfr 45–59 ml/min/1.73 m2) . age anastomotic strictures found associated decline egfr. currently, possible recommend particular type urinary diversion. however, institutions prefer ileal orthotopic neobladders ileal conduits based clinical experience. selected patients, patients single
