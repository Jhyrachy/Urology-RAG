4.5.7.9. Removal/excision/section/loosening of mid-urethral sling. In women who develop BOO after placement of a mid-urethral sling, surgical management may include tape loosening, incision or division, and excision and/or removal of the tape [462]. Several small retrospective reviews of cases using different techniques of sling revision (incision, partial excision, or excision) showed good success rates in terms of symptom reduction, resumption of voiding with significant reduction in PVR volume and improvement of urodynamic parameters. Stress urinary incontinence recurs in a small proportion of patients and often to a lesser degree than prior to the sling procedure. Studies have shown long-term efficacy, including preservation of continence. In a series of 63 women who presented with voiding dysfunction and persistent PVR volume > 100 mL after tape surgery for UI, different techniques were compared. Comparisons involved sling revision: sling division (n = 46) vs. partial sling excision (n = 13) vs. sling revision (division or excision) with an additional anti-SUI procedure (n = 4). The authors reported an overall success rate of 87% (PVR volume < 150 mL). No significant difference in success rates was demonstrated among the different revision techniques. There was a greater need for surgery for recurrent SUI in the partial sling excision group without an anti-SUI procedure (23% vs.2.2 and 0) [579]. One study showed that patients who underwent surgical release > 180 days after initial anti-UI surgery had significantly less recurrent SUI compared with patients who underwent the release sooner (15% vs. 46%) [580].
