3.5.1. Introduction. Recurrent UTIs (rUTIs) are recurrences of uncomplicated and/or complicated UTIs, with a frequency of at least three UTIs/year or two UTIs in the last six months. Although rUTIs include both lower tract infection (cystitis) and upper tract infection (pyelonephritis), repeated pyelonephritis should prompt consideration of a complicated aetiology. Recurrent UTIs negatively impact patient quality of life leading to a reduction in the quality of social and sexual relationships, self-esteem and capacity for work [143].
