6.1. TaT1 tumours. Treatment should take into account a patient’s prognosis. In order to predict the risk of disease recurrence and/or progression, several prognostic models for specified patient populations have been introduced. 6.1.1. Scoring models using the WHO 1973 classification system 6.1.1.1. The 2006 European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) scoring model To be able to predict both the short- and long-term risks of disease recurrence and progression in individual patients, the EORTC Genito-Urinary Cancer Group (GUCG) published a scoring system and risk tables based on the WHO 1973 classification in 2006 [221]. The scoring system is based on the 6 most significant clinical and pathological factors in patients mainly treated by intravesical chemotherapy: number of tumours;tumour diameter;prior recurrence rate;T category;concurrent CIS;WHO 1973 tumour grade. Using the 2006 EORTC scoring model, individual probabilities of recurrence and progression at 1 and 5 years may be calculated (https://www.omnicalculator.com/health/eortc-bladder-cancer). 6.1.1.2. The model for patients with Ta G1/G2 (WHO 1973) tumours treated with chemotherapy Patients with Ta G1/G2 tumours receiving chemotherapy were stratified into 3 risk groups for recurrence, taking into account the history of recurrences, history of intravesical treatment, tumour grade (WHO 1973), number of tumours and adjuvant chemotherapy [222]. 6.1.1.3. Club Urologico Español de Tratamiento Oncologico (CUETO) scoring model for BCG-treated patients A model that predicts the risk of recurrence and progression, based on 12 doses of intravesical BCG over a 5 to 6 months period following TURB, has been published by the CUETO (Spanish Urological Oncology Group). It is based on an analysis of 1,062 patients from 4 CUETO trials that compared different intravesical BCG treatments. No immediate post-operative instillation or second TURB was performed in these patients. The scoring system is based on the evaluation of seven prognostic factors: gender;age;prior recurrence status;number of tumours;T category;associated CIS;WHO 1973 tumour grade. Using this model, the calculated risk of recurrence is lower than that obtained by the EORTC tables. For progression, probability is lower only in high-risk patients [223] (LE: 2a). The lower risks in the CUETO tables may be attributed to the use of BCG in this study. The prognostic value of the EORTC scoring system has been confirmed by data from the CUETO patients treated with BCG [224] and by long-term follow-up in another patient population [225]. 6.1.1.4. The 2016 EORTC scoring model for patients treated with maintenance BCG In 1,812 intermediate- and high-risk patients without CIS treated with 1 to 3 years of maintenance BCG, the EORTC found that the prior disease-recurrence rate and number of tumours were the most important prognostic factors for disease recurrence, stage and WHO 1973 grade for disease progression and disease- specific survival, while age and WHO 1973 grade were the most important prognostic factors for OS. T1 G3 patients did poorly, with 1- and 5-year disease-progression rates of 11.4% and 19.8%, respectively. Using these data, EORTC risk groups and nomograms for BCG-treated patients were developed [226]. 6.1.2. Scoring model using the WHO 2004/2016 and WHO 1973 classification systems 6.1.2.1. EAU NMIBC 2021 scoring model To update the risk of disease progression and create new prognostic factor risk groups using both the WHO 1973 and WHO 2004/2016 classification systems (without central pathology review), individual patient data from 3,401 primary patients treated from 1990 to 2018 were used [227] (see Section 4.5). Only patients treated with TURB ± intravesical chemotherapy were included, those treated with adjuvant intravesical BCG were excluded because BCG may reduce the risk of disease progression. From the multivariate analyses, tumour stage, WHO 1973 grade, WHO 2004/2022 grade, concomitant CIS, number of tumours, tumour size and age were independent predictors of disease progression [227]. This is the only available model where the WHO 2004/2022 classification system is included as one of the parameters to calculate an individual patient’s risk group and probability of progression. As the WHO 2004/2022 classification system is the main grading classification system used by pathologists, the Guidelines Panel recommends to use the 2021 EAU NMIBC scoring model for risk groups definition (see Section 6.3). The 2021 EAU NMIBC scoring model determines the risk of tumour progression, but not recurrence; therefore any of the models mentioned in Section 6.1.1 may be used for calculation of an individual’s risk of disease recurrence. 6.1.3. Further prognostic factors Further prognostic factors have been described in selected patient populations: In T1 HG/G3 tumours, important prognostic factors were female sex, CIS in the prostatic urethra in men treated with an induction course of BCG, and age, tumour size and concurrent CIS in BCG-treated patients (62% with an induction course only) [177,228].Attention must be given to patients with T1 HG/G3 tumours in bladder diverticulum because of the absence of muscle layer in the diverticular wall [229].In patients with T1 tumours, the finding of residual T1 disease at second TURB is an unfavourable prognostic factor [212-214].In patients with T1G2 tumours treated with TURB, recurrence at 3 months was the most important predictor of progression [230].The prognostic value of pathological factors has been discussed elsewhere (see Section 4.6). More research is needed to determine the role of molecular markers in improving the predictive accuracy of currently available risk tables [225,231].
