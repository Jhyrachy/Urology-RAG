5.2.1. Digital rectal examination. In ~18% of cases, PCa is detected by suspect DRE alone, irrespective of PSA level [156]. A suspect DRE in patients with a PSA level ≤ 2 ng/mL has a positive predictive value (PPV) of 5–30% [156]. In the ERSPC trial, an abnormal DRE in conjunction with an elevated PSA more than doubled the risk of a positive biopsy (48.6% vs. 22.4%) [157]. An abnormal DRE is associated with an increased risk of a higher ISUP grade, predicts clinically significant PCa in men under AS (active surveillance) [158] and is an indication for MRI and biopsy [157,159]. Clinical T-staging is dependent on DRE, and it remains a strong predictor of advanced PCa (OR: 11.12 for cT3 and OR: 5.28 for cT4) [160].
