infection typically spread sexual contact. 3.10.2. epidemiology, aetiology pathogenesis therapeutic clinical point view, gonorrhoeal urethritis (gu) caused neisseria gonorrhoeae must differentiated non-gonococcal urethritis (ngu). non-gonococcal urethritis non-specific diagnosis many infectious aetiologies. causative pathogens include chlamydia trachomatis, mycoplasma genitalium, ureaplasma urealyticum trichomonas vaginalis. role ureaplasma spp. urethritis causative pathogens controversial. recent data suggests u. urealyticum, u. parvum aetiological agent ngu . prevalence isolated causative pathogens are: c. trachomatis 11-50%; m. genitalium 6-50%; ureaplasmas 5-26%; t. vaginalis 1-20%; adenoviruses 2-4% . causative agents either remain extracellularly epithelial layer penetrate epithelium (n. gonorrhoeae c. trachomatis) cause pyogenic infection. although arising urethritis, chlamydiae gonococci spread urogenital tract cause epididymitis men cervicitis, endometritis
