8.2. Which imaging investigations for which patients, and when?. The sensitivity of chest radiography and US for detection of small RCC metastases is poor. The sensitivity of chest radiography is significantly lower than CT-scans, as proven in comparative studies including histological evaluation [654-656]. Therefore, follow-up for recurrence detection with chest radiography and US are less sensitive [657].Positron-emission tomography and PET-CT as well as bone scintigraphy should not be used routinely in RCC follow-up, due to their limited specificity and sensitivity [117,131].Surveillance should also include evaluation of renal function and cardiovascular risk factors [644].Outside the scope of regular follow-up imaging of the chest and abdomen, targeted imaging should be considered in patients with organ-specific symptoms, e.g., CT or MRI imaging of the brain in patients experiencing neurological symptoms [658]. Controversy exists on the optimal duration of follow-up. Some authors argue that follow-up with imaging is not cost-effective after five years; however, late metastases are more likely to be solitary and justify more aggressive therapy with curative intent. In addition, patients with tumours that develop in the contralateral kidney can be treated with NSS if the tumours are detected early. Several authors have designed scoring systems and nomograms to quantify the likelihood of patients to develop tumour recurrences, metastases, and subsequent death [250,252,659,660]. These models, of which the most utilised are summarised in Chapter 6 - Prognosis, have been compared and validated [661] (LE: 2). Using prognostic variables, several stage-based follow-up regimens have been proposed, although, none propose follow-up strategies after ablative therapies [662,663]. A post-operative nomogram is available to estimate the likelihood of freedom from recurrence at five years [247]. Recently, a pre-operative prognostic model based on age, symptoms and TNM staging has been published and validated [664] (LE: 3). A follow-up algorithm for monitoring patients after treatment for RCC is needed, recognising not only the patient’s risk of recurrence profile, but also the efficacy of the treatment given (Table 8.1). These prognostic systems can be used to adapt the follow-up schedule according to predicted risk of recurrence. Ancillary to the above, life-expectancy calculations based on comorbidity and age at diagnosis may be useful in counselling patients on duration of follow-up [665].

The table above provides recommendations on follow-up strategies for low, intermediate and high risk ofrecurrence in patients curatively treated for localised RCC either with NSS or RN. Computed tomography in the table refers to imaging of both chest and abdomen. Alternatively, MRI of the abdomen can be performedinstead of a CT-scan.* Risk of recurrence profiles should be based on validated prognostic models. The EAU RCC Guidelines Panel recommends the 2003 Leibovich model for ccRCC [250]. However, other validated models can be used by physicians based on their own national/regional recommendations. In a similar fashion, for curatively treated localised non-ccRCC, the Panel recommends the use of the University of California Los Angeles integrated staging system (UISS) to determine risk of recurrence [251].** For all risk of recurrence profiles, functional follow-up, mainly monitoring renal and cardiovascular function, may continue according to specific clinical needs irrespective of the length of the oncological follow-up.*** For low-risk profiles at > 3 years and intermediate-risk at > 5 years of follow-up respectively, consider counselling patients about terminating oncological follow-up imaging based on assessment of comorbidities, age, life expectancy and/or patient wishes.
