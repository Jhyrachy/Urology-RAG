4.6. Prostate-specific antigen. 4.6.1. Prostate-specific antigen and the prediction of prostatic volume Pooled analysis of RCTs, of men with LUTS and presumed BPO, showed that prostate-specific antigen (PSA) has a good predictive value for assessing prostate volume, with areas under the curve (AUC) of 0.76-0.78 for various prostate volume thresholds (30 mL, 40 mL, and 50 mL). To achieve a specificity of 70%, whilst maintaining a sensitivity between 65-70%, approximate age-specific criteria for detecting men with prostate glands exceeding 40 mL are PSA > 1.6 ng/mL, > 2.0 ng/mL, and > 2.3 ng/mL, for men with BPH in their 50s, 60s, and 70s, respectively [56]. A strong association between PSA and prostate volume was found in a large community-based study in the Netherlands [57]. A PSA threshold value of 1.5 ng/mL could best predict a prostate volume of > 30 mL, with a positive predictive value (PPV) of 78%. The prediction of prostate volume can also be based on total and free PSA. Both PSA forms predict the TRUS prostate volume (Â± 20%) in > 90% of the cases [58,59]. 4.6.2. Prostate-specific angtigen and the probability of PCa The role of PSA in the diagnosis of PCa is presented by the EAU Guidelines on Prostate Cancer [60]. The potential benefits and harms of using serum PSA testing to diagnose PCa in men with LUTS should be discussed with the patient. 4.6.3. Prostate-specific antigen and the prediction of BPO-related outcomes Serum PSA is a stronger predictor of prostate growth than prostate volume [61]. In addition, an RCT showed that PSA also predicted the changes in symptoms, QoL/bother, and maximum flowrate (Qmax) [62]. In a longitudinal study of men managed conservatively, PSA was a highly significant predictor of clinical progression to urinary retention [63,64]. In the placebo arms of large double-blind studies, baseline serum PSA predicted the risk of acute urinary retention (AUR) and BPO-related surgery [65,66]. An equivalent link was also confirmed by the Olmsted County Study. The risk for treatment was higher in men with a baseline PSA of > 1.4 ng/mL [67]. Patients with BPO seem to have a higher PSA level and larger prostate volumes. The PPV of PSA for the detection of BPO was recently shown to be 68% [68]. Furthermore, in an epidemiological study, elevated free PSA levels could predict clinical BPE, independent of total PSA levels [69]. Summary of evidenceLEProstate-specific antigen (PSA) has a good predictive value for assessing prostate volume and is a strong predictor of prostate growth.1bBaseline PSA can predict the risk of AUR and BPO-related surgery.1b RecommendationsStrength ratingMeasure prostate-specific antigen (PSA) if a diagnosis of prostate cancer will change management.StrongMeasure PSA if it assists in the treatment and/or decision-making process.StrongCounsel patients about PSA testing and the implications of a raised PSA test.Strong
