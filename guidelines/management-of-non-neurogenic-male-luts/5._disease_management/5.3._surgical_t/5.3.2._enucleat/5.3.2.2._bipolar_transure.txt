5.3.2.2. Bipolar transurethral enucleation of the prostate. Mechanism of action: Following the principles of bipolar technology (section 5.3.1.1), the obstructive adenoma is enucleated endoscopically by the transurethral approach. Currently, two technologies exist, namely plasmakinetic (PK) enucleation of the prostate (PKEP) and bipolar plasma enucleation of the prostate (BPEP) [378,383,384]. Bipolar transurethral enucleation of the prostate is followed by either morcellation [378,385] or resection [383,386-390] of the enucleated adenoma. Efficacy: Two meta-analyses, reported similar efficacy at twelve months in terms of IPSS, QoL score and Qmax for B-TUEP (PKEP or BPEP) vs. B-TURP [391,392]. Another meta-analysis evaluating B-TUEP vs. B-TURP, reported similar efficacy at 36 months in terms of IPSS, and Qmax [340]. One RCT evaluating PKEP vs. M-TURP reported a significant improvement in IPSS, QoL score, and Qmax, with urodynamically proven de-obstruction favouring PKEP at 36-months follow-up [387]. One RCT evaluating PKEP vs. B-TURP in patients with prostate volume > 80 mL reported no clinically relevant differences in IPSS, QoL score, and Qmax, at six months follow up [393]. Another RCT evaluating BPEP vs. B-TURP in patients with prostate volume > 80 mL reported not clinically relevant differences in IPSS, QoL score, Qmax and PVR at 24-months follow-up [394] Two RCTs evaluated the mid-term efficacy of PKEP vs. B-TURP at 36 months [388,389] and one RCT evaluated long-term efficacy at 60 months [390]. Efficacy was significantly better for PKEP in patients with large prostates at 36, 48 and 60 months [388,390]. Comparative data on efficacy for B-TUEP vs. OP and the various forms of laser enucleation are presented in section 5.3.2.1 – 5.3.2.5, respectively. Tolerability and safety: Two meta-analyses evaluating B-TUEP vs. B-TURP reported similar operation, catheterisation and hospitalisation times; lower acute urine retention rates; significantly reduced haemoglobin drop and blood transfusion rates; no difference in ED; and no difference in all other reported complication rates including urethral stricture/BNC rates for B-TUEP at 24-months follow-up [391,392]. [394]. A meta-analyses evaluating PKEP vs. TURP reported that mid-term IIEF-5 scores were comparable [395]. Another meta-analyses reported less bleeding with B-TUEP compared to M-TURP but similar UI rates and AUR after catheter removal [340]. An RCT evaluating PKEP vs. M-TURP in patients with prostate volume < 80 mL and 36-month follow-up reported that PKEP is superior to M-TURP in terms of catheterisation, and hospitalisation time [387]. No significant differences between the arms were reported in operation time, blood transfusion rates, sexual function, or any other reported complications (TUR-syndrome, clot retention, incontinence, retrograde ejaculation, urethral structures/BNC) [387]. One RCT evaluating PKEP vs. B-TURP in patients’ prostate volume > 80 mL and six months follow-up reported that PKEP is superior to B-TURP in terms of operation, catheterisation and hospitalisation time [393]. Significant differences were reported in blood transfusion, BNC and retrograde ejaculation rates favouring PKEP, but no differences in urethral stricture and ED rates were reported [393]Another RCT evaluating BPEP vs. B-TURP in patients with prostate volume > 80 mL reported that BPEP had longer operative time but shorter catheterisation, hospitalisation time with no differences in blood transfusion, urethral stricture and UI rates at 24-months follow-up [394]. No difference in urethral stricture/BNC rates was reported at 60 months follow-up [390]. Comparative data on efficacy for B-TUEP vs. OP and the various forms of laser enucleation are presented in section 5.3.2.1 – 5.3.2.5, respectively. Summary of evidenceLEBipolar transurethral PKEP shows favourable mid- to long-term efficacy compared to TURP.1bBipolar transurethral PKEP has a favourable peri-operative safety profile and demonstrates similar mid- to long-term safety compared to TURP.1b RecommendationStrength ratingOffer bipolar transurethral (plasmakinetic) enucleation of the prostate to men with moderate-to-severe LUTS as an alternative to transurethral resection of the prostate.Weak
