3.7. Pad testing. Measurement of urine loss using an absorbent pad worn over a set period of time or during a protocol of physical exercise can be used to quantify the presence and severity of UI, as well as provide objective evidence of response to treatment. The clinical utility of pad tests in woman with UI has been assessed in three SRâ€™s [92-94]. One SR included eighteen studies and concluded that 1-hour pad test was more accurate but less reproducible when compared to the longer duration pad tests. A 1-hour pad test using a standardised exercise protocol and a diagnostic threshold of 1.4 g shows good specificity but lower sensitivity for symptoms of SUI and MUI. A 24-hour pad test using a threshold of 4.4 g is more reproducible but is difficult to standardise, with variation according to activity level [95]. A pad test with a specific short graded exercise protocol also has diagnostic value but a negative test should be repeated with the degree of provocation increased [96]. The usefulness of pad tests in quantifying severity and predicting outcome of treatment is uncertain [92,97,98]. Pad tests are responsive to change following successful treatment [99]. Pad testing using a standardised bladder volume (50% of cystometric capacity) was suggested to allow for a more reliable assessment of UI in a small study of 25 women [100]. There is no evidence that one type of pad test is superior to another. 3.7.1. Summary of evidence and recommendations for pad testing Summary of evidenceLEA pad test can diagnose UI accurately.2Standardisation of bladder volume and degree of provocation improves reproducibility.2Twenty-four hours is sufficient duration for home-based testing balancing diagnostic accuracy and adherence.1aChange in leaked urine volume on pad tests can be used to measure treatment outcome.2Pad tests can be a useful tool in the research setting and are an optional investigation in clinical practice.4 RecommendationsStrength ratingWhen a pad test is performed, use a standardised duration and activity protocol.StrongUse a pad test when quantification of urinary incontinence is required, especially to assess response to treatment.Weak
