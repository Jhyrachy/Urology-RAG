4.5.3. Classification. 4.5.3.1. Anatomic bladder outlet obstruction Anatomical BOO involves a physical or mechanical obstruction of the outflow of urine not related to urethral or pelvic muscle tone. 4.5.3.2. Functional bladder outlet obstruction Functional BOO involves a non-anatomical, non-neurogenic obstruction of the outflow of urine resulting from non-relaxation or increased tone in the bladder neck and/or urethral sphincter complex or the PFMs (Table 5). Neurological causes of functional BOO are not considered in these guidelines and are covered in the EAU Guidelines on Neuro-urology [9].

Recommendation for classification of bladder outlet obstruction RecommendationStrength ratingUse standardised classification of bladder outlet obstruction in women (anatomical or functional), and research populations should be fully characterised using such classification.Strong
