5.3. Summary of evidence and guidelines for the diagnosis and staging of penile cancer. Summary of evidenceLEFor distinguishing T1 from T2 disease, MRI does not outperform clinical staging.2bFor predicting corporal invasion (T3 disease), MRI showed a pooled sensitivity and of 80% (95% CI: 70–87%) and 96% (95% CI: 85–99%), respectively.2bMagnetic resonance imaging with and without artificial erection showed similar accuracy in local staging.2bComputed Tomography, PET/CT and MRI imaging cannot detect micro-metastases and are therefore of limited value in clinically node-negative patients in which the aim is to identify small sub-clinical LN metastasis.2aInguinal US + FNAC of sonographically abnormal nodes can reduce the need of DSNB when tumour positive, allowing for earlier therapeutic treatment of node-positive disease.2aFor surgical staging of cN0 patients, DSNB has shown a high diagnostic accuracy.2aSentinel node biopsy has been shown to lower complication rates compared to modified-, superficial-, or video-endoscopic inguinal LND.2bImaging with 18FDG-PET/CT in clinically node-positive patients showed higher sensitivity/specificity than CT alone in the pre-operative staging of the pelvic LNs and distant metastasis.2b RecommendationsStrength ratingPrimary tumourPerform a detailed physical examination of the penis and external genitalia, recording morphology, size and location of the penile lesion, including extent and invasion of penile (adjacent) structures.StrongPerform magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the penis/primary tumour (artificial erection not mandatory) when there is uncertainty regarding corporal invasion and/or the feasibility of (organ-sparing) surgery. If MRI is not available, offer ultrasound (US) as alternative option.WeakObtain a pre-treatment biopsy of the primary lesion when malignancy is not clinically obvious, or when non-surgical treatment of the primary lesion is planned (e.g., topical agents, laser, radiotherapy).StrongInguinal lymph nodes (LN)Perform a physical examination of both groins. Record the number, laterality and characteristics of any palpable/suspicious inguinal nodes.StrongClinically node-negative (cN0)If there are no palpable/suspicious nodes (cN0) at physical examination, offer surgical LN staging to all patients at high risk of having micro-metastatic disease (T1b or higher).StrongIn case of T1a G2 disease, also discuss surveillance as an alternative to surgical staging with patients willing to comply with strict follow-up.WeakWhen surgical staging is indicated, offer dynamic sentinel node biopsy (DSNB). If DSNB is not available and referral is not feasible, or if preferred by the patient after being well informed, offer inguinal lymph node dissection (ILND) (open or video-endoscopic).StrongIf DSNB is planned, perform inguinal US first, with fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) of sonographically abnormal LNs.StrongClinically node-positive (cN+)If there is a palpable/suspicious node at physical examination (cN+), obtain (image-guided) biopsy to confirm nodal metastasis before initiating treatment.StrongIn cN+ patients, stage the pelvis and exclude distant metastases with 18F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography (18FDG-PET) computed tomography (CT) or CT of the chest and abdomen before initiating treatment.Strong
