3.13.4.2. medical therapy. antimuscarinic/anticholinergic medication reduces/prevents detrusor overactivity lowers intravesical pressure . effects side effects depend distribution m1-m5 receptors . bladder, subtype m2 m3 present . oxybutynin frequently used children neurogenic bladder success rate 93% . dose-dependent side-effects (such dry mouth, facial flushing, blurred vision heat intolerance etc.) limit use. intravesical administration gives significant higher bioavailability due circumvention intestinal first pass metabolism, well possible local influence c-fiber-related activity responsible different clinical effect . intravesical administration considered patients severe side-effects, long-term results demonstrated well-tolerated effective . transdermal administration also leads substantially lower ratio n-desethyloxybutynin oxybutynin plasma levels, however, treatment-related skin reactions 12 41 patients . concerns central anticholinergic adverse effects associated oxybutynin . double blinded cross-over trial, well case control study, showed deleterious effect children’s attention memory . tolterodine, solifenacine, fesoterodin, trospium chloride propiverine combinations also used children [746-754]. oral dosage oxybutynin 0.2 mg/kg given three times daily. intravesical dosage 0.7 mg/kg/daily transdermal 1.3-3.9 mg/daily. dosage drugs is: tolterodine 0.5 – 4 mg/day divided two doses, solifenacin 1.25 10 mg per day (single dose), fesoterodine 4-8 mg per day (single dose) propiverin 0.8 mg/kg/day divided two dosages trospium chloride 3 times 15 mg starting 3 times 5 mg. except oxybutynin, anticholinergic drugs off-label use, explained caregivers. early prophylactic treatment anticholinergics showed lower rate renal deterioration well lower rate progression bladder augmentation . beta-3 agonists like mirabegron adjuvant treatment shown effective safe recent studies children (> five years) adolescents [756-759]. alpha-adrenergic antagonists may facilitate emptying children neurogenic bladder . doxazosin initial dose 0.5 1.0 mg tamsulosin hydrochloride medium (0.0002-0.0004 mg/kg/day) high dose (0.0004-0,0008 mg/kg/day) given children neurogenic bladders [760-762]. well tolerated effective least one study . botulinum toxin injections: neurogenic bladders refractory anticholinergics, off-label use suburothelial intramuscular injection onabotulinum toxin detrusor muscle treatment option . children, continence could achieved 32-100% patients, decrease maximum detrusor pressure 32% 54%, increase maximum cystometric capacity 27% 162%, improvement bladder compliance 28%-176% . onabotulinum toxin seems effective bladders obvious detrusor muscle over-activity, whereas non-compliant bladders without obvious contractions unlikely respond . also, injections trigone seems save regard reflux upper tract damage; benefit investigated . patients failed augmentation cystoplasty, 43% responded well intra-detrusor onabotulinum toxin injections recent series 30 patients . used dose onabotulinum toxin 10 12 u/kg maximum dose 200 u 360 u . randomized trail demonstrated, 200ie greater efficacy reducing bladder pressure increasing bladder capacity compared 50 100ie . onabotolinum toxin effective three twelve (0-25) months repeated injections effective ten years one study [768-770]. urethral sphincter onabotulinum toxin injection shown effective decreasing urethral resistance improve voiding. evidence still low recommend routine use decreasing outlet resistance, could considered alternative refractory cases . neuromodulation intravesical electrical stimulation bladder [773-775], sacral nerve stimulation transcutaneous neuromodulation still experimental cannot recommended outside clinical trials. true intradural somatic-to-autonomic nerve anastomosis. urethral dilatation aim lower pop-off pressure lowering detrusor leak-point pressure dilatation external sphincter general anaesthesia 36 charr. studies showed, especially females, procedure safe selected patients, effective [780-782]. vesicostomy vesicostomy - preferably blocksom stoma - option reduce bladder pressure children/new-borns, caregivers incompliant ic and/or ic urethra extremely difficult impossible . especially young infant severe upper tract dilatation infections, vesicostomy considered. patients may also good long-term solution prevent infection renal deterioration . drawbacks difficulty fitting maintaining collecting appliance older patients. cystostomy button may alternative, complication rate (mostly uti) 34% within mean follow-up 37 months .
