6.1.2.1. Width of negative surgical margins. The concept of organ-preserving surgery is based on observations of how the distance between tumour and resection margin affects local recurrence. A study found that most lesions do not spread > 5 mm beyond the macroscopic margin and, in line with this finding, subsequent reports show that an excision margin of between 5 mm and 10 mm results in acceptably low recurrence rates [148-150]. Another study from a supra-regional referral centre found that local recurrence rates only increased considerably when the distance from tumour to margin was < 1 mm [151]. However, comparative evidence is lacking for this topic and there is no clear evidence as to what constitutes an oncologically safe width of macroscopic negative surgical margins. Based on the observation that in lower-risk tumours (1) a local recurrence does not impact survival and (2) minimal section margins > 1 mm do not result in a higher risk for local recurrence, macroscopic margins can indeed be minimal, specifically in smaller and less aggressive lesions. Hence, to ensure complete removal with histologically negative margins, standard excision must include a margin of clinically normal-appearing skin around the tumour and surrounding erythema. However, for bulky or higher-grade lesions where local recurrence may have an impact on survival, adoption of a wider margin or partial penectomy may be prudent and should be discussed with the patient [145,150].
