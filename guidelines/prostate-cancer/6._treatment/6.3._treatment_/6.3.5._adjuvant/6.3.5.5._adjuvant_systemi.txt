6.3.5.5. Adjuvant systemic therapy in N0 disease. Adjuvant androgen ablation with bicalutamide 150 mg daily did not improve PFS in localised disease while it did for locally-advanced disease after RT. However, this never translated to an OS benefit [848]. A SR showed a possible benefit for PFS but not OS for adjuvant androgen ablation [786]. The TAX3501 trial comparing the role of leuprolide (18 months) with and without docetaxel (6 cycles) ended prematurely due to poor accrual. A phase III RCT comparing adjuvant docetaxel against surveillance after RP for locally-advanced PCa showed that adjuvant docetaxel did not confer any oncological benefit [849]. Consequently, adjuvant chemotherapy after RP should only be considered in a clinical trial [850].
