3.4.8. General recommendations and precautions for stone removal. 3.4.8.1. Antibiotic therapy Urinary tract infections should always be treated if stone removal is planned. In patients with clinically significant infection and obstruction, drainage should be performed for several days before starting stone removal. A urine culture or urinary microscopy should be performed before treatment [301]. Peri-operative antibiotic prophylaxisThe available evidence for prevention of infection following URS and percutaneous stone removal, remains limited [302]. Administration of a single dose of prophylactic antibiotics prior to ureteroscopy was found to be sufficient [302-304]. In a review of a large database of patients undergoing PCNL, it was found that in patients with negative baseline urine culture, antibiotic prophylaxis significantly reduced the rate of postoperative fever and other complications [305]. Based on three meta-analyses, pooling data from small series with varying quality an extended course of pre-operative prophylactic antibiotics prior to PCNL compared to a single dose before anaesthesia significantly reduced post-operative sepsis and fever in patients with an a priori increased risk of infection [288,306,307]. In an RCT including only moderate to high-risk infection patients (patients with pre-operative stents/nephrostomy or positive urine culture), a seven-day course of pre-operative antibiotics reduced the risk of post-PCNL sepsis threefold in comparison to a two-day course [308]. In studies that did not specify the risk of the patient population, a single dose of antibiotic prophylaxis administered at induction was equivalent to an extended pre-operative course [307,309]. In contrast to this, a prolonged course of post-operative antibiotics was not superior to a single dose pre-operatively [288,307]. As national and regional antibiotic resistance patterns can differ significantly, the choice of antibiotic prophylaxis should be tailored to institutional or regional antimicrobial susceptibility [304]. RecommendationsStrength ratingObtain a urine culture or perform urinary microscopy before any treatment is planned.StrongExclude or treat urinary tract infections prior to stone removal.StrongOffer peri-operative antibiotic prophylaxis to all patients undergoing endourological treatment.Strong 3.4.8.2. Antithrombotic therapy and stone treatment Patients with a bleeding disorder, or receiving antithrombotic therapy, should be referred to an internist for appropriate therapeutic measures before deciding on stone management [310-314]. In patients with an uncorrected bleeding disorder, the following are at elevated risk of haemorrhage or perinephric haematoma (PNH) (high-risk procedures): SWL (hazard ratio of PNH up to 4.2 during anti-coagulant/anti-platelet medication) [315]PCNL;percutaneous nephrostomy;laparoscopic surgery;open surgery [310]. Shock wave lithotripsy is feasible and safe after correction of the underlying coagulopathy [316,317]. In the case of an uncorrected bleeding disorder or continued antithrombotic therapy, URS, in contrast to SWL and PCNL, might offer an alternative approach since it is associated with less morbidity [318-320]. Despite the appropriate cessation of anti-platelet agents, following standardised protocols, prolonged haematuria in tube drainage after PCNL has been reported [321]. Only data on flexible URS are available which support the superiority of URS in the treatment of proximal ureteral stones [322,323]. Although URS is safe in patients with bleeding disorders or anticoagulation, an individualised patient approach is necessary [320].

Obesity A high BMI can pose a higher anaesthetic risk and a lower success rate after SWL and PCNL and may influence the choice of treatment [325]. 3.4.8.4. Stone composition Stones composed of brushite, calcium oxalate monohydrate, or cystine are particularly hard, as well as homogeneous stones with a high density on NCCT [326,327]. Percutaneous nephrolithotomy or RIRS and URS are alternatives for removal of large SWL-resistant stones. RecommendationsStrength ratingConsider the stone composition before deciding on the method of removal, based on patient history, former stone analysis of the patient or Hounsfield unit on unenhanced computed tomography.StrongAttempt to dissolve radiolucent stones.Strong 3.4.8.5. Contraindications of procedures Contraindications of extracorporeal SWLThere are several contraindications to the use of extracorporeal SWL, including: pregnancy, due to the potential effects on the foetus [328];bleeding disorders, which should be compensated for at least 24 hours before and 48 hours after treatment [329];uncontrolled UTIs;severe skeletal malformations and severe obesity, which prevent targeting of the stone;arterial aneurysm in the vicinity of the stone [330];anatomical obstruction distal to the stone. Contraindications of URSApart from general problems, for example with general anaesthesia or untreated UTIs, URS can be performed in all patients without any specific contraindications. Contraindications of PCNLPatients receiving anti-coagulant therapy must be monitored carefully pre- and post-operatively. Anti-coagulant therapy must be discontinued before PCNL [320]. Other important contraindications include: untreated UTI;tumour in the presumptive access tract area;potential malignant kidney tumour;pregnancy (Section 3.4.14.1). General contraindication for endourological proceduresEndourological interventions do not adversely affect renal function although care must be taken in those with poor pre-operative renal function, diabetes and hypertension [331]. However, a meta-analysis, based on low quality evidence, suggests that patients with impaired renal function and stone disease, may in fact benefit from the procedure to preserve or increase their renal function [332].
