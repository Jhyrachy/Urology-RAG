6.3.2. Residual tumour resection. 6.3.2.1. Seminoma A residual mass of seminoma should initially be monitored with imaging and tumour markers [198-200]. As FDG-PET has a high NPV, in patients with residual masses > 3 cm in largest diameter, this should be considered in order to provide more information on disease viability [201-203]. It should not be performed until at least two months after completion of chemotherapy, as inflammation and the desmoplastic reaction induced by chemotherapy may result in a false positive result [204]. The NPV for active disease is > 90% which can be reassuring [201,202]. In contrast PPV ranges from 23-69% and thus caution is advised on initiating active therapy driven only by positive findings on FDG-PET-CT [205]. When a post-chemotherapy mass remains positive at reclassification with FDG-PET with no volume increase, repeat FDG-PET should be performed six weeks later. A recent publication shows a low PPV for vital tumours in residual lesions (generally > 3 cm) after chemotherapy in metastatic seminoma (11-38% depending on sub-group). Therefore, caution is recommended with FDG-PET as a single parameter to drive clinical decisions in a persistent mass [205]. In patients with progressive disease on radiological criteria (i.e., a growing mass which enhances with CECT or is FDG-PET avid), salvage therapy is indicated [206-208]. Patients with persistently high and/or progressing β-hCG elevation after first-line chemotherapy should proceed to salvage chemotherapy. Progressing patients without β-hCG progression should undergo histological verification (e.g., by percutaneous or surgical biopsy) before salvage chemotherapy is given. When RPLND is indicated, this should be performed in referral centres, as residual seminoma masses may be extremely difficult to remove due to intense fibrosis [207]. 6.3.2.2. Non-seminoma Following first-line BEP it has be reported that about 7% of residual masses contain active cancer, 33% post-pubertal teratoma, and 40% necrotic-fibrotic tissue only [209]. The remainder comprise rarer entities including malignant transformation of teratoma. Restaging patients following chemotherapy with FDG-PET is not indicated [54,55,204]. With complete radiological remission, RPLND is not indicated [210,211]. Usual timing for restaging is three to four weeks after the beginning of the last cycle. No diagnostic or risk calculator can accurately predict histology of the residual masses. Thus, resection is mandatory in all patients with a residual mass > 1 cm in transaxial long axis at cross-sectional CECT imaging until novel predictive models are externally validated [212-215]. Surgery when indicated should be performed within six to eight weeks after the last chemotherapy cycle. The role of surgery with residual retroperitoneal lesions < 1 cm is uncertain. It is difficult to distinguish between a true residual node below 10 mm and a complete remission, and many authors consider these situations as equivalent. Residuals containing cancer or teratoma are possible, but the vast majority of patients have fibro-necrotic tissue only [216]. Whilst post-chemotherapy RPLND with residuals < 10 mm in transaxial long axis or complete remission is an option [217], the alternative option is close surveillance with recurrence risk of 6-9% depending on the follow-up duration [209-211,218]. In the series with the longest follow-up of 15.5 years, twelve (9%) of 141 patients relapsed despite a complete response following primary treatment [211,218]. Eight of the twelve relapsing patients were cured with subsequent treatment. These cases should be discussed on individual basis considering the orientation and expectations of the patient. Residual masses after salvage chemotherapy or HDCT in first or subsequent salvage situations have a greater risk of active disease [219]. Surgery is therefore indicated even with residual masses < 1 cm [210,211]. When resection is indicated, bilateral nerve sparing RPLND is the standard option. Ipsilateral template resection avoids contralateral nerve dissection and may be considered for residuals with a diameter < 5 cm [220], as well as unilateral lymph node metastases on pre- and post-chemotherapy CT scans, left-sided tumours only require para-aortic resection whereas right-side tumours need paracaval and inter-aortocaval resection down to the iliac arteries [221,222]. Mapping studies indicate the potential risk of contralateral disease with this approach is low at around 1-3% [221,223]. The mere resection of the residual tumour (so called lumpectomy) should not be performed [211,215,216,219,220,222,224]. Laparoscopic or robotic RPLND may yield comparable outcomes to open procedures in selected cases, with low-volume residual disease and when undertaken by highly experienced surgeons. This should only be considered in specialist TC centres with expertise in open RPLND and minimally invasive surgery to ensure appropriate case selection. In this setting, up to 30% of post-chemotherapy RPLND have been reported via a laparoscopic approach [225-227]. Experience with robot-assisted laparoscopic RPLND, and specifically long-term outcomes remains limited [228]. Atypical recurrences have been reported and occur more often with this approach [128].
