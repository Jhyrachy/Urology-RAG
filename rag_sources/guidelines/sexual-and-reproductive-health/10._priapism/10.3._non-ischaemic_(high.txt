10.3. non-ischaemic (high-flow arterial) priapism. non-ischaemic priapism persistent erection caused unregulated cavernous arterial inflow . according aetiology, non-ischaemic priapism categorised four types: traumatic, neurogenic, iatrogenic idiopathic origin. 10.3.1. epidemiology/aetiology/pathophysiology epidemiological data non-ischaemic priapism almost exclusively derived small case series [1336,1364,1478-1480]. non-ischaemic priapism significantly less common ischaemic type, comprising 5% priapism cases . frequent cause non-ischaemic priapism blunt perineal penile trauma . injury results laceration cavernosal artery branches, leading fistula artery lacunar spaces sinusoidal space . resultant increased blood flow results persistent prolonged erection . often delay trauma development priapism may two three weeks . suggested reflect either spasm ischaemic necrosis injured artery, fistula developing spasm resolves ischaemic segment “blows up”. priapism typically occurs nocturnal erection erection related sexual activity, resulting sudden increase blood flow pressure cavernous arteries . patient typically reports erection fully rigid associated pain venous drainage compromised penile tissue become ischaemic . non-ischaemic priapism occur acute spinal cord injury, presumably due loss sympathetic input, leading predominant parasympathetic input increased arterial flow . also reported occur following internal urethrotomy , nesbit procedure , circumcision , transrectal prostate biopsy , brachytherapy prostate cancer . cases also described following shunting procedures performed ischaemic priapism due lacerated cavernosal artery (conversion low-flow high-flow priapism) [1492-1494]. although scd usually associated ischaemic priapism, occasional cases high-flow priapism reported; however, pathophysiological mechanism remains unclear . finally, metastatic malignancy penis also rarely cause non-ischaemic priapism . 10.3.2. diagnostic evaluation
