Posterior stenosis after surgery for benign prostatic obstruction. 6.3.5.1.3.2.1.Bladder neck reconstruction for bladder neck stenosis after surgery for benign prostatic obstruction The bladder neck is augmented by advancement of local bladder flaps (Y-V or T-plasty) with or without resection of scar tissue. They are used for BNS refractory to endoscopic treatments [409,416-418]. Patency rates vary between 83-100% with fourteen to 45 months follow-up [409,416-418]. There is a trend to perform bladder neck reconstruction by minimally invasive approach (laparoscopic, robot-assisted) [409,417,418]. De novo incontinence rate ranges from 0-14% [409,416-418]. Satisfaction among patient is high with 88.5% of patients stating that they are pleased with the surgery, with an improvement of QoL in 75% of patients [416,418]. Recently, a robot-assisted augmentation technique with subtrigonal buccal mucosa inlay has been successfully reported in a case report, but this technique requires further investigation [419]. See supplementary Table S6.14 for further information. 6.3.5.1.3.2.2.Bulbomembranous strictures after surgery for benign prostatic obstruction Bulbomembranous urethral strictures (BMS) after TURP or simple prostatectomy are managed as bulbar strictures and can be treated by EPA or augmentation urethroplasty with a graft, taking into account the length and tightness of the stricture [82]. Kulkarni et al. reported a similar patency rate for dorsal and ventral onlay urethroplasty (resp. 81.8% versus 84.6% after mean follow-up of 14 months) [420]. As reconstruction is in the proximity of the external sphincter and the bladder neck was already damaged during BPO surgery, the risk of incontinence (up to 25%) is present [82]. Summary of evidenceLEBladder neck reconstruction with Y-V or T-plasty for treatment refractory BNS has patency rates of 83-100%.3Incontinence occurs in up to 14% with bladder neck reconstruction and up to 25% after reconstruction of BMS after previous surgery for BPO.3 RecommendationsStrength ratingPerform bladder neck reconstruction with Y-V or T-plasty for treatment refractory bladder neck stenosis (BNS).WeakWarn patients about de novo urinary incontinence after reconstruction for BNS or bulbomembranous urethral strictures with previous benign prostatic obstruction surgery as aetiology.Strong
