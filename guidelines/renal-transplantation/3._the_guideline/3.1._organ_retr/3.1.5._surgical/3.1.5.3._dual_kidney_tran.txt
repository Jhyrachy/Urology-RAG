3.1.5.3. Dual kidney transplants. Dual kidney transplant (DKT) is performed when the quality of a single deceased donor kidney is thought to be insufficient for appropriate long-term graft function and that the outcome with both kidneys would be better. A variety of surgical techniques have been described to implant the pair of donor kidneys [129]. These include unilateral extra-peritoneal (UEP) or intra-peritoneal (UIP) and bilateral extra-peritoneal (BEP) or intra-peritoneal (BIP) that can be via a midline [130] or two lateral incisions. The aim of a unilateral approach is to leave the contralateral iliac fossa intact for future transplantation in the event of graft loss and to reduce CIT for the second kidney transplant [131]. The unilateral approach may require mobilisation and division of the internal iliac vein to facilitate the two renal veins to iliac vein anastomoses. Modifications of the unilateral technique include single renal artery and vein anastomoses (with bench reconstruction) to further reduce CIT for the second kidney [132-134]. Dual kidney transplant takes longer and has higher blood loss than SKT regardless of the technique used. Data suggest shorter operative time and hospital stay with UEP compared to BEP [135] but other data suggest similar outcomes from all DKT techniques. No RCT exists to recommend one technique for all patients or situations. En-bloc retrieval is performed when kidneys are retrieved from children weighing < 15 kg. Depending on the size of the donor kidney and size and weight of the adult recipient(s), en-bloc transplantation of the two kidneys may be performed or, if appropriate, the aorta and IVC patch may be divided for SKT [136].
