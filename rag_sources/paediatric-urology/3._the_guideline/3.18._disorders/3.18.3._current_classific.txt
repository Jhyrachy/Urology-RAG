3.18.3. current classification dsd conditions. number published updates since international consensus conference ‘intersex’ subsequent publications classification various conditions dsd. latest published global dsd update consortium 2016 . field dsd continuously developing, knowledge viewpoints change time, effort made consider diversity, inclusion, equality, therefore representatives support advocacy groups continue invited, aim focus patient care best possible quality life. according international consensus 2005, dsds defined congenital conditions within development chromosomal, gonadal and/or anatomic sex atypical. changes made according terminology follows: 46xx dsd – formerly termed female pseudohermaphrodite, over-virilisation xx female, masculinisation xx female. group vast majority due classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia (cah) various degrees masculinisation. among dsd conditions together, 46xx cah patients comprise approximately 80% cases. conditions extremely important since potentially life threatening days birth due salt-loss phenomenon, immediate medical care mandatory. 46xy dsd – previously termed male pseudohermaphroditism, undervirilisation xy male, undermasculinisation xy male. group often quite heterogenous includes partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (pais), well complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (cais) formerly called testicular feminisation. sex chromosome mosaicism dsd (45x; 45x/46xy; 47xxy) – cohort consists multiple variants mixed gonadal dysgenesis important one. many normal male phenotype others may asymmetric genitalia. one scrotal half often contains gonad likely testis whereas side keeping labia majora usually palpable gonad, likely streak gonad. ovotesticular dsd – previously described ‘true hermaphrodite’ presence ovarian testicular tissue co-existing individual meaning. great variability phenotype uni- bilateral undescended gonads, present one ovary one testis, one two ovotestes. non-hormonal/non-chromosomal dsd – cohort introduced well, including newborns cloacal exstrophy bladder intestines exposed midline mesenchymal defect resulting failure clocal membrane retract, rutpures. others cohort include patients aphallia, severe micropenis. latter one normally formed penis stretched length < 2.5 standard deviation mean . micropenis distinguished buried webbed penis, usually normal size. length penis measured dorsal aspect, stretching penis, pubic symphysis tip glans .
