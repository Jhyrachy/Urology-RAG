11.3.7. Summary of evidence and recommendations for the diagnostic work-up of male infertility. Summary of evidenceLESemen analysis alone cannot distinguish fertile from infertile men.2aDiagnosis of male infertility is associated with an increased risk of death and comorbidities.2aMale infertility evaluation should include a medical, reproductive and family history, assessment of lifestyle and behavioural risk factors, physical examination, semen analysis and hormonal evaluation.2aGenetic analysis and imaging may be required depending on the clinical features and semen parameters.2aTesticular volume can be measured with a Prader orchidometer or using testicular ultrasound.2aSemen analyses is described in the latest edition of the WHO Manual for the Examination and Processing of Human Semen. Abnormal semen characteristics are expressed as below the 5th percentiles of a reference population of 3500 men who contributed to a natural conception within 12 months.3Oxidative stress has a detrimental impact on sperm quality but there is a lack of validated assays to measure ROS and oxidative stress in the evereday clinical practice.2bHigh sperm DNA fragmentation index (SDF) is associated with reduced pregnancy rates via natural conception or intra-uterine insemination, poor assisted reproductive techniques (ART) outcomes, recurrent pregnancy loss and unexplained infertility.2aA possible advantage of the use of testicular sperm for ICSI in patients with high SDF in ejaculated sperm has not been confirmed in large scale RCTs.3Gonadotropins and total testosterone measurement are useful to diagnose testicular deficiency and to classify the type of hypogonadism.2aFollicle-stimulating hormone values have been negatively associated with sperm count.2aChromosomal abnormalities are frequently found in men with severe oligozoospermia (spermatozoa <5 million/mL) or azoospermia.2aKlinefelter syndrome is associated with non-obstructive azoospermia, hypogonadism and general health problems, including metabolic, cardiovascular and oncologic diseases.2aCystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene mutations may be associated with congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens CBAVD and obstructive azoospermia.2aThe prevalence of renal anomalies is rare for patients with unilateral and bilateral absence of the vas deferens and CFTR mutations.2aThe highest frequency of Y-microdeletions is found in azoospermic men followed by oligospermic men but is extremely rare with a sperm concentration > 5 million/mL.2aComplete deletions that include the AZFa and AZFb regions are of poor prognostic significance for retrieving sperm with surgery.2aTesticular sperm can be found in 50-75% of men with AZFc microdeletions.2aMale offspring of men with AZF microdeletions will inherit the deletion.2aGenetic abnormalities found during the diagnostic work-up might impact on the psychological and overall health of the couple and the offspring.2aScrotal ultrasound is used to measure testicular volume, assess testicular anatomy including detecting signs of obstruction and testicular dysgenesis.2aInfertile men have a higher risk of testicular cancer compared to fertile controls.2aAn essential approach for infertile men with US-detected indeterminate testicular lesion is a multidisciplinary discussion with focus on the size of the lesion, echogenicity, vascularity and previous patient’s history (e.g., cryptorchidism, previous history of germ cell tumour [GCT]).2aScrotal ultrasound is useful in assessing venous reflux and diameter of the spermatic vein, mostly when palpation is unreliable or in detecting recurrence/persistence after surgery2aIn patients with a low seminal volume, acidic pH and either severe oligozoospermia or azoospermia in the absence of CBAVD, transrectal ultrasound should be used to detect complete or partial ejaculatory duct obstruction2b RecommendationsStrength ratingInclude a parallel assessment of the fertility status, including ovarian reserve, of the female partner during the diagnosis and management of the infertile male, since this might determine decision making in terms of timing and therapeutic strategies (e.g., assisted reproductive technology (ART) versus surgical intervention).StrongExamine all men seeking medical help for fertility problems, including men with abnormal semen parameters.StrongTake a complete medical reproductive and family history, assessment of lifestyle and behaviour risk factors, physical examinationand semen analysisStrongCounsel infertile men or men with abnormal semen parameters on the associated health risks.WeakAssess testicular volume with a Prader’s orchidometer or testicular ultrasound (US).WeakPerform semen analyses according to the latest edition of the WHO Manual for the Examination and Processing of Human Semen. Perform at least two consecutive semen analyses if the baseline analysis was abnormal.StrongDo not routinely use reactive oxygen species (ROS) testing in the diagnosis and management of the male partner of an infertile couple.WeakPerform sperm DNA fragmentation (SDF) testing in the assessment of couples with recurrent pregnancy loss from natural conception and failure of ART or men with unexplained infertility.StrongConsider the use of testicular sperm for ICSI in patients with high SDF in ejaculated sperm as experimentalWeakPerform a hormonal evaluation including serum total testosterone and Follicle Stimulating Hormone/Luteinising Hormone at least in all cases of oligozoospermia and azoospermia.StrongOffer standard karyotype analysis and genetic counselling to all men with azoospermia and oligozoospermia (spermatozoa < 5 million/mL) for diagnostic purposes.StrongProvide long-term endocrine follow-up and appropriate medical treatment to men with Klinefelter syndrome.StrongPerform Y-chromosome microdeletion testing in men with sperm concentrations of ≤ 1 million sperm/mL. Considerit in men with sperm concentrations of < 5 million sperm/mL.StrongInform men with Yq microdeletion and their partners who wish to proceed with intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) that microdeletions will be passed to sons.StrongDo not perform testicular sperm extraction in patients with complete deletions that include the AZFa and AZFb regions.StrongTest men with structural abnormalities of the vas deferens (unilateral or bilateral absence with no renal anomalies) and their partners for cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene mutations.StrongProvide genetic counselling in all couples with a genetic abnormality found on clinical or genetic investigation and in patients who carry a (potential) inheritable disease.StrongPerform scrotal US in patients with infertility, as there is a higher risk of testis cancer.WeakDiscuss invasive diagnostic modalities (e.g., US-guided testicular biopsy with frozen section versus radical orchidectomy versus surveillance) in infertile men with US-detected indeterminate testicular lesions, especially if additional risk factors for malignancy are present in a multidisciplinary team setting.WeakPerform transrectal US if a partial or complete distal obstruction is suspected.Strong
