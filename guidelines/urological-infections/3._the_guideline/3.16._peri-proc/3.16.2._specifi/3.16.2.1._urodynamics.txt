3.16.2.1. Urodynamics. The literature search identified one systematic review for antibiotic prophylaxis in women only [529]. This included 3 RCTs (n=325 patients) with the authors reporting that prophylactic antibiotics reduced the risk of bacteriuria but not clinical UTI after urodynamics [529]. A previous Cochrane review identified nine RCTs enrolling 973 patients with overall low quality and high or unclear risks of bias [530]. The outcome of clinical UTI was reported in four trials with no benefit found for antibiotic prophylaxis vs. placebo [RR (95%CI) 0.73 (0.52-1.03)]. A meta-analysis of nine trials showed that use of antibiotics reduced the rate of post-procedural bacteriuria [RR (95%CI) 0.35 (0.22-0.56)] [530].
