5.3. Serum tumour markers. 5.3.1. Pre-operative serum tumour markers Serum AFP, beta subunit of human Chorionic Gonadotropin (β-hCG) and LDH should be determined before orchidectomy as they support the diagnosis of TC and may be indicative of GCT histology. Up to 90% of NSGCT’s have elevated AFP or β-hCG at diagnosis with 39% having an increased level of both [48,61]. Pure seminomas may also have elevated β-hCG level at diagnosis in up to 30% of cases [61]. Significant elevation of AFP in patients with seminomas should raise concerns of a NSGCT component. Modest stable marker elevations may be considered ‘normal’ and of no clinical significance [45]. Thus, current tumour markers have limitations due to their low sensitivity as normal levels do not exclude the presence of disease. 5.3.2. Serum tumour markers after orchidectomy Tumour markers need to be repeated following orchidectomy providing staging and prognostic information [45]. If elevated pre-operatively normalisation may take several weeks as the serum half-lives of AFP and β-hCG are five to seven days and one to three days respectively. If these remain elevated or increase metastatic disease is likely [61]. Marker normalisation after orchiectomy however does not exclude the possibility of metastatic disease. In addition to staging marker levels are used to define risk stratification and prognosis (Table 4). They are also used to monitor treatment response and detect disease relapse [61]. With follow-up the precise frequency of testing is not well defined [62]. 5.3.3. Other tumour markers Micro RNAs (miRNAs) are emerging as potential new biomarkers. Pre-operative elevation has been reported in 80-90% of both SGCT and NSGCT with higher levels in metastatic compared to localised disease [63]. A number of studies suggest higher discriminatory accuracy for micro-RNA (miRNAs) (particularly miR-371a-3p) compared to conventional GCT markers in diagnosis, clinical staging, treatment monitoring, and predicting of residual or recurrent viable disease [63-65]. Furthermore, they may differentiate between GCT and other (stromal/non-germ cell originated) tumours [65]. Issues which need to be resolved for use in routine clinical practice include laboratory standardisation, availability of the test and, importantly, prognostic validation [66]. As with both AFP and β-hCG miRNA is not expressed in teratoma which will limit its use in NSGCT.
