8.3. sex cord-stromal tumours. sex cord–stromal tumours relatively uncommon represent second largest group primary testicular tumours gct’s . small subset tumours clinically malignant, thorough evaluation morphological features associated malignancy performed guide management. two following features associated malignant potential: size > 5 cm, infiltrative borders, cytological atypia, three mitotic figures per ten high-power fields, vascular invasion necrosis . 8.3.1. leydig cell tumours leydig cell tumours comprise 4% adult testicular tumours . mainly present localised tumours metastases occurring 2.5% . may present hormonal manifestations, including gynaecomastia rarely accompanied cushing’s syndrome . testis-sparing surgery local recurrence rate 7% reported although adjuvant treatment options recommended . several risk factors metastatic disease proposed may guide image-guided follow-up intensity . survival men metastatic disease poor occasional responses surgical resection, feasible, lesser extent systemic treatment reported . 8.3.2. sertoli cell tumours sertoli cell tumours account approximately 1% testicular neoplasms . risk metastases unclear. testis sparing surgery local recurrence rate < 1% reported although adjuvant treatment options recommended . several risk factors metastatic disease proposed may guide image guided follow-up intensity . survival men metastatic disease poor although response surgery occasionally reported . 8.3.3. granulosa cell tumour granulosa cell tumours, include adult juvenile variants, extremely rare metastatic potential unclear . testis sparing surgery local recurrence rate 5% reported although adjuvant treatment options recommended . whereas metastatic disease never reported juvenile granulosa cell tumours, men adult type may occasionally present metastatic disease . survival men metastatic disease poor although rare instances response surgical systemic treatment reported . 8.3.4. thecoma/fibroma group tumours tumours derive testicular parenchymal stroma tunica albuginea. seem uniformly benign . 8.3.5. paratesticular tumours epididymis spermatic cord majority epididymal masses benign cystic inflammatory conditions. solid epididymal tumours rare comprise numerous benign neoplastic lesions. population-based analyses , majority neoplastic lesions epididymis spermatic cord sarcomas, metastases organs primary adenocarcinomas similar proportions reported institutional studies . benign lesions, may comprise majority clinical practice include lipomas, adenomatoid tumours leiomyomas papillary cystadenomas. robust criteria differentiate neoplastic benign lesions defined although ultrasonography without fine needle aspiration mri surgical exploration fse histopathological confirmation considered. clear recommendation provided regarding surgical approach, extent resection neo- adjuvant treatment given.
