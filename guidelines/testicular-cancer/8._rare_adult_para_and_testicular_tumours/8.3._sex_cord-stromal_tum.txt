8.3. Sex cord-stromal tumours. Sex cord–stromal tumours are relatively uncommon but represent the second largest group of primary testicular tumours after GCT’s [292]. As a small subset of these tumours are clinically malignant, a thorough evaluation of those morphological features associated with malignancy should be performed to guide management. Two or more of the following features are associated with malignant potential: size > 5 cm, infiltrative borders, cytological atypia, three or more mitotic figures per ten high-power fields, vascular invasion and necrosis [292]. 8.3.1. Leydig cell tumours Leydig cell tumours comprise about 4% of adult testicular tumours [293]. These mainly present as localised tumours with metastases occurring in only 2.5% [294]. They may present with hormonal manifestations, including gynaecomastia and more rarely are accompanied by Cushing’s Syndrome [389]. With testis-sparing surgery a local recurrence rate of 7% has been reported although no adjuvant treatment options can be recommended [295]. Several risk factors for metastatic disease have been proposed which may guide image-guided follow-up intensity [295]. Survival of men with metastatic disease is poor but occasional responses to surgical resection, if feasible, and to a lesser extent systemic treatment have been reported [295]. 8.3.2. Sertoli cell tumours Sertoli cell tumours account for approximately 1% of testicular neoplasms [292]. The risk of metastases is unclear. With testis sparing surgery a local recurrence rate of < 1% has been reported although no adjuvant treatment options can be recommended [296]. Several risk factors for metastatic disease have been proposed which may guide image guided follow-up intensity [296]. Survival of men with metastatic disease is poor although response to surgery has been occasionally reported [296]. 8.3.3. Granulosa cell tumour Granulosa cell tumours, which include adult and juvenile variants, are extremely rare and metastatic potential is unclear [292]. With testis sparing surgery a local recurrence rate of 5% has been reported although no adjuvant treatment options can be recommended [297]. Whereas metastatic disease has never been reported in juvenile granulosa cell tumours, men with adult type may occasionally present with metastatic disease [297]. Survival of men with metastatic disease is poor although rare instances of response to surgical or systemic treatment has been reported [297]. 8.3.4. Thecoma/fibroma group of tumours These tumours derive from the testicular parenchymal stroma or from the tunica albuginea. They seem to be uniformly benign [292,298]. 8.3.5. Paratesticular tumours of the epididymis or spermatic cord The majority of epididymal masses are benign cystic or inflammatory conditions. Solid epididymal tumours are rare and comprise numerous benign and neoplastic lesions. In the only population-based analyses [299], the majority of neoplastic lesions of the epididymis or spermatic cord were sarcomas, metastases from other organs or primary adenocarcinomas similar to proportions reported in institutional studies [300,301]. Benign lesions, which may comprise the majority in clinical practice include lipomas, adenomatoid tumours leiomyomas and papillary cystadenomas. Robust criteria to differentiate between neoplastic benign lesions have not been defined although ultrasonography with or without fine needle aspiration [302] MRI [53,303] or surgical exploration with FSE or histopathological confirmation can be considered. No clear recommendation can be provided regarding surgical approach, extent of resection and neo- or adjuvant treatment can be given.
