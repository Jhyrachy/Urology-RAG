4.1.4.2.3.1. Applicability of evidence to the general elderly population. It is not clear how much the data from pooled and subgroup analyses from large RCTs can be extrapolated to a general ageing population. Community-based studies of the prevalence of anticholinergic adverse effects may be the most helpful [226]. When starting anticholinergics in elderly patients, mental function should be assessed and monitored [227]. No consensus exists as to the best mental function test to detect changes in cognition [207,228].
