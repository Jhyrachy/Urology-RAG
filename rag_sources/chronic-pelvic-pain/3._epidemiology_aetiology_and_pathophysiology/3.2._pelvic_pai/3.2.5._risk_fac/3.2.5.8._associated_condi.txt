infection, trauma, surgical incisions post-operative scarring may result nerve injury . pudendal neuralgia often mentioned form nerve damage literature. anatomical variations may pre-dispose patient developing pudendal neuralgia time repeated low-grade trauma (such sitting prolonged periods time cycling) . pudendal nerve may damaged level of: piriformis muscle. example, part piriformis syndrome: cases, nerve may pass muscle hence trapped; cases, muscle hypertrophy spasm implicated.the sacrospinal/sacrotuberous ligaments, possibly accounting 42% cases.within alcock’s canal (medial obturator internus muscle, within fascia muscle), possibly accounting 26% cases.multiple levels 17% cases.the site injury determines location perceived pain nature associated symptoms (e.g., distal damage, less likely anal region involved). clinical presentation depends different factors. wide age range, one would expect, condition many potential causes. suggested that, younger patient, better prognosis. essentially, sooner diagnosis made, compression nerve injury, better prognosis, older patients may protracted problem . six ten cases observed women. special situations listed: orthopaedic hip surgery, pressure positioning patient, perineum placed hard brace, result pudendal nerve damage . surgery may also directly damage nerve. pelvic surgery sacrospinous fixation clearly associated pudendal nerve damage cases . many types surgery, including colorectal, urological gynaecological, pudendal nerve injury may implicated.fractures sacrum pelvis may result pudendal nerve/root damage pain. falls trauma gluteal region may also produce pudendal nerve damage associated significant tissue injury prolonged pressure.tumours pre-sacral space must considered. tumours invading pudendal nerve may occur may also damage surgery pelvic cancer .the pudendal neuralgia birth trauma thought resolve cases period months. however, rarely, appears continue painful neuropathy. multiple pregnancies births may predispose stretch neuropathy later life. difficult certain .child birth repeated abdominal straining associated chronic constipation thought pre-dispose elderly women post-menopausal pelvic floor descent stretching pudendal nerve associated pain. changes hormone status may also factor. urogenital pain management centres, commonest associations pudendal neuralgia appear be: history pelvic surgery; prolonged sitting; post-menopausal older women. sexual dysfunction chronic pelvic pain clinical condition results complex interactions physiological psychological factors direct impact social, personal professional lives men women. men chronic pain well treatment impair ability express sexuality. england study, 73% patients chronic pain degree sexual problems result pain . problems occur several factors. psychological factors like pain catastrophising, decrease self-esteem, depression anxiety contribute problem severity . physiological factors like fatigue, nausea pain cause sexual dysfunction. pain medications (opioids, selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors [ssris]) also decrease libido delay ejaculation. number studies effects cppps sexual function limited. sexual dysfunction often ignored lack standardised measurements. present, commonly used tool iief questionnaire . presence pelvic pain may increase risk ed independent age . hand, cross-sectional data suggest improvement lower urinary tract symptoms (luts) increased frequency ejaculation . although mental distress impaired qol related illness could contribute sexual dysfunction observed patients ppps, presence erectile ejaculatory disorders frequently related symptoms suggestive severe inflammatory condition . arguments important understanding close relationship cppps symptoms, disturbed sexuality, impact qol, psychological implications including depression failure anticipation thoughts [104-106,200-202]. sexual dysfunction heightens anger, frustration depression, place strain patients’ relationships. female partners men sexual dysfunction depression often present similar symptoms including pain upon intercourse depressive symptoms. men cppps reported high frequency sexual relationship dissolution psychological symptoms, depression suicidal thinking . hand, found men ppps report significantly decreased sexual satisfaction compared controls . consensus therapeutic strategies reducing symptoms pelvic pain relevance relation changes sexual function. also intimacy sex yield positive experiences reduce pain. cns plays important role mechanism. women chronic pelvic pain leads substantial impairment qol several sexual dysfunctions . seems reasonable expect pain, extreme fatigue, depressive mood pain drugs affect women’s sexuality. women cppps reported significantly pain, depression, anxiety symptoms physically impaired women control group. comparison controls, women cppps reported significantly sexual avoidance behaviour, non-sensuality, complaints “vaginismus” . patients cppps reported sexual problems women type chronic pain problem . quality intimate relationships closely connected sexual function . satisfaction sexual relationships appears associated higher marital functioning . addition sexual dissatisfaction related sexual dysfunction. one partner suffers chronic pain, ability partners cope pain extent partners supportive chronic pain sufferer found predictor sexual functioning . approximately two-thirds patients another study reported reduced frequency sexual relations result cppps . one study demonstrated cppps patients reported worse sexual function regard desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction, frequent severe pain vaginal penetration women without cppps . interview 50 chronic pain sufferers spouses, 78% pain sufferers 84% partners described deterioration, including cessation sex life . study patients back pain, half reported decreased frequency sex since onset chronic pain . female sexual function index (fsfi) developed brief, multi-dimensional self-report instrument assessing key dimensions sexual function women, includes desire, subjective arousal, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction, pain. using fsfi, women cppps reported worse sexual function subscales total score women without cppps. largest differences women cppps without cppps, seen domains pain arousal. total

often overlooked form chronic pelvic pain. pelvic floor adjacent muscles used abnormal way. studies field chronic prostatitis support idea patients cppps muscle spasm increased muscle tone report pain pelvic floor muscles palpated . learning pelvic floor muscle relaxation diminish spasm pain . repeated chronic muscular overload activate trigger points pelvic floor muscles. report chronic prostatitis cohort study showed 51% patients prostatitis 7% controls muscle tenderness. tenderness pelvic floor muscles found cppps group . first ideas neurological aspects pelvic floor muscles relation chronic pelvic pain published 1999. possibility cns changes regulation pelvic floor function suggested mechanism development cppps. patients presenting pelvic pain, 88% poor absent pelvic floor muscle function . animal studies role neurogenic inflammation also elucidated important phenomena. irritation prostate, bladder pelvic floor muscles results expression c-fos-positive cells cns. appears convergence afferent information onto central pathways. central changes become established, become independent peripheral input initiated . repeated chronic muscular overload activate trigger points muscle. trigger points defined hyper-irritable spots within taut band. criteria trigger points recognition pain ‘familiar’, pain stretching muscle. apart pain, trigger points prevent full lengthening muscle, thereby restricting range movement. pain result trigger points aggravated specific movements alleviated certain positions. positions movements shortened muscle stretched painful. patients know activities postures influence pain. trigger points located within pelvic floor muscles adjacent muscles abdominal, gluteal iliopsoas muscles. pain aggravated pressure trigger point (e.g., pain related sexual intercourse). pain also worsens sustained repeated contractions pelvic floor muscles (e.g., pain related voiding defecation).
