3.5.2. Carcinoma associated with end-stage renal disease; acquired cystic disease-associated RCC. Cystic degenerative changes (acquired cystic kidney disease [ACKD]) and a higher incidence of RCC, are typical features of ESRD. Renal cell carcinomas of native end-stage kidneys are found in approximately 4% of patients with ESRD. Their lifetime risk of developing RCCs is at least ten times higher than in the general population. Compared with sporadic RCCs, RCCs associated with ESRD are generally multicentric and bilateral, found in younger patients (mostly male), and are less aggressive. Whether the relatively indolent outcome of tumours in ESRD is due to the mode of diagnosis or a specific ACKD-related molecular pathway still has to be determined. Although the histological spectrum of ESRD tumours is like that of sporadic RCC; pRCC occur relatively more frequently [28,36]. A specific subtype of RCC occurring only in end-stage kidneys has been described as “acquired cystic disease-associated RCC” (ACD-RCC). Tumours present exclusively in patients with ACKD, usually after long-term dialysis. The vast majority occur in men. Tumours are often multiple and bilateral and, in most cases, have an indolent clinical behaviour; although, aggressive courses have been documented [22].
