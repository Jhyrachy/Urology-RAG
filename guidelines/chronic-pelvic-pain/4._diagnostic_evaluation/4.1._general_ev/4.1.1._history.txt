4.1.1. History. History is very important for the evaluation of patients with chronic pelvic pain. Pain syndromes are symptomatic diagnoses, which are derived from a history of pain perceived in the region of the pelvis, and absence of other pathology, for a minimum of three months. This implies that specific disease-associated pelvic pain caused by bacterial infection, cancer, drug-induced pathology (e.g., ketamine use) [225], primary anatomical or functional disease of the pelvic organs, and neurogenic disease must be ruled out. 4.1.1.1. Anxiety, depression, and overall function Distress is best understood in the context of pain and of the meaning of pain to the individual and is best assessed ideographically rather than normatively. Almost all diagnostic measures and standardised instruments of anxiety and depression are designed for people without significant physical problems, so are difficult to interpret in chronic pelvic pain [226]. Anxiety about pain often refers to fears of missed pathology (particularly cancer) as the cause of pain [37], or to uncertainties about treatment and prognosis. These can drive healthcare seeking behaviour. The question: “What do you believe or fear is the cause of your pain?” has been suggested [227]. Anxiety may also concern urinary urgency and frequency that are problematic in social settings. Depression or depressed moods are common in chronic pain [228], often related to losses consequent to chronic pain (work, leisure activities, social relationships, etc.). Due to the lack of suitable assessment instruments, it is better to ask a simple question such as “How does the pain affect you emotionally?” If the answer gives cause for concern about the patient’s emotional state, further assessment should be undertaken by an appropriately qualified colleague. Most measures of restricted function are designed primarily for musculoskeletal pain and may emphasise mobility problems rather than the difficulties of the individual with pelvic or urogenital pain. A promising specific measure, UPOINT, was introduced and in a later version the sexological aspects were added [229]. However, it may underassess relevant psychological variables [44]. Generic QoL measures are helpful. If such an instrument is not already used in the clinic, the Brief Pain Inventory [230] provides a broad and economical assessment of interference of pain with various aspects of life, and is available in multiple languages. (For further suggested instruments see [231]). 4.1.1.2. Urological aspects Pain may be associated with urological symptoms. A detailed history of LUT functions should be taken. Dysfunctions of the LUT may exacerbate symptoms, as pain may interfere with the function of the LUT. Micturition in all its aspects should be addressed. Special attention should be paid to the influence of micturition on the experience of pain. Primary prostate pain syndrome Primary prostate pain syndrome is diagnosed from a history of pain perceived in the region of the prostate (convincingly reproduced by prostate palpation), and absence of other LUT pathology, for a minimum of three months. As mentioned above, specific disease-associated pelvic pain must be ruled out. A thorough history is an important first step in the evaluation of PPPS. It should include type of pain and localisation. Pain is often reported in other pelvic areas outside the prostate such as perineum, rectum, penis, testicles and abdomen [50]. In addition, associated LUT symptoms, sexual function, psychological, social and economic factors should be addressed. Determination of the severity of disease, its progression and treatment response can be assessed only by means of a validated symptom-scoring instrument (see Section 4.2.3). These subjective outcome measures are recommended for the basic evaluation and therapeutic monitoring of patients in urological practice. Primary bladder pain syndrome Primary bladder pain syndrome should be diagnosed on the basis of pain, pressure or discomfort associated with the urinary bladder, accompanied by at least one other symptom, such as daytime and/or night-time increased urinary frequency, the exclusion of confusable diseases as the cause of symptoms, and if indicated, cystoscopy with hydrodistension and biopsy (Table 4) [16]. The nature of pain is key to disease definition: pain, pressure or discomfort perceived to be related to the bladder, increasing with increasing bladder content;located suprapubically, sometimes radiating to the groins, vagina, rectum or sacrumrelieved by voiding but soon returns [232,233];aggravated by food or drink [233]. Primary bladder pain syndrome type 3 can lead to a small capacity fibrotic bladder with or without upper urinary tract outflow obstruction. 4.1.1.3. Gynaecological aspects A detailed medical history outlining the nature, frequency and site of pain; its relationship to precipitating factors and the menstrual cycle, may help define the aetiology. A menstrual and sexual history, including a history of sexually transmitted diseases, vaginal discharge, as well as previous sexual trauma is mandatory as well as up to date cervical cancer screening. A history of obstetric and/or gynaecological surgery is also warranted, particularly if devices such as synthetic mesh were used. 4.1.1.4. Gastrointestinal aspects The predominant symptoms that patients are interviewed about are discomfort or pain in relation to their bowel habits, daily activities, and eating. A precise history of dysfunctional voiding or defecation should be asked, ideally applying symptom questionnaires for urinary and anorectal symptoms (e.g., Rome IV criteria for anorectal pain). Excessive straining at most defecations, anal digitations in dyssynergic defecation, and a sensation of anal blockage may be found in patients with chronic anal pain. History of anxiety and depression with impaired QoL is often encountered in anorectal functional disorders and should be evaluated. Diagnostic criteria for primary chronic anal pain syndrome (chronic proctalgia) according to the Rome IV criteria are as follows and must include all of the following: chronic or recurrent rectal pain or aching, episodes last at least thirty minutes and exclusion of other causes of rectal pain such as ischaemia, inflammatory bowel disease, cryptitis, intramuscular abscess and fissure, haemorrhoids, prostatitis, and Coccyx Pain Syndrome. These criteria should be fulfilled for the past three months with symptom onset at least six months before diagnosis [17,234]. The primary chronic anal pain syndrome includes the above diagnostic criteria and exhibits exquisite tenderness during posterior traction on the puborectalis muscle (previously called “Levator Ani Syndrome”). Pathophysiology of pain is thought to be due to over-activity of the pelvic floor muscles and probably recto-anal incoordination. Primary intermittent chronic anal pain syndrome (proctalgia fugax) consists of all the following diagnostic criteria, which should be fulfilled for three months: recurrent episodes of pain localised to the anus or lower rectum, episodes last from several seconds to minutes and there is no anorectal pain between episodes. Stressful life events or anxiety may precede the onset of the intermittent chronic anal pain syndrome. The attacks may last from a few seconds to as long as 30 minutes. The pain may be cramping, aching or stabbing and may become unbearable. However, most patients do not report it to their physicians and pain attacks occur less than five times a year in 51% of patients. 4.1.1.5. Peripheral nerve aspects A proportion of patients will be able to relate the onset of pain to an acute event such as surgery, sepsis or trauma, and occasionally, cycling for a prolonged period. Chronic injury is more frequent, such as associated with sitting for prolonged periods over time. Many will be idiopathic. The pain is classically perceived in the perineum from anus to clitoris/penis. However, less-specific pain distribution may occur, and this may be due to anatomical variation, involvement of branches of the nerve rather that the main nerve, CNS central sensitisation, and consequently, the involvement of other organs and systems in a regional pain syndrome. Other nerves in the vicinity may also be involved, for example, inferior cluneal nerve and perineal branches of the posterior femoral cutaneous nerve. The musculoskeletal system may become involved, confusing the pain picture as aches and pain developing in the muscles due to immobility and disability, possibly magnified by the CNS changes. Burning is the most predominant adjective used to describe the pain. Crushing and electric may also be used, indicating the two components - a constant pain often associated with acute sharp episodes. Many patients may have the feeling of a swelling or foreign body in the rectum or perineum, often described as a golf or tennis ball. The term pain has different meanings to patients and some would rather use the term discomfort or numbness. Aggravating factors include any type of pressure being applied, either directly to the nerve or indirectly to other tissue, resulting in pudendal traction. Allodynia is pain on light touch due to involvement of the CNS, and may make sexual contact and the wearing of clothes difficult. These patients often remain standing, and as a consequence, develop a wide range of other aches and pains. Soft seats are often less well-tolerated, whereas sitting on a toilet seat is said to be much better tolerated. If unilateral, sitting on one buttock is common. The pain may be exacerbated by bowel or bladder evacuation. Pudendal nerve damage may be associated with a range of sensory phenomena. In the distribution of the nerve itself, as well as unprovoked pain; the patient may have paraesthesia (pins and needles); dysaesthesia (unpleasant sensory perceptions usually but not necessarily secondary to provocation, such as the sensation of running cold water); allodynia (pain on light touch); or hyperalgesia (increased pain perception following a painful stimulus, including hot and cold stimuli). Similar sensory abnormalities may be found outside of the area innervated by the damaged nerve, particularly for visceral and striated muscle hyperalgesia. The cutaneous sensory dysfunction may be associated with superficial dyspareunia, but also irritation and pain associated with clothes brushing the skin. There may also be a lack of sensation and pain may occur in the presence of numbness. Visceral hypersensitivity may result in an urge to defecate or urinate. This is usually associated with voiding frequency, with small amounts of urine being passed. Pain on visceral filling may occur. Anal pain and loss of motor control may result in poor bowel activity, with constipation and/or incontinence. Ejaculation and orgasm may also be painful or reduced. Many of those suffering from pudendal neuralgia complain of fatigue and generalised muscle cramps, weakness and pain. Being unable to sit is a major disability, and over time, patients struggle to stand and they often become bedbound. The immobility produces generalised muscle wasting, and minimal activity hurts. As a consequence of the widespread pain and disability, patients often have emotional problems, and in particular, depression. Patients with chronic pelvic pain are also often anxious and have the tendency to catastrophise. Depression, catastrophising and disability are all poor prognostic markers. Cutaneous colour may change due to changes in innervation but also because of neurogenic oedema. The patient may describe the area as swollen due to this oedema, but also due to the lack of afferent perception. 4.1.1.6. Myofascial aspects When taking a history from a patient with pelvic pain, it is important to address the function of all the organs in the pelvic area. The following items certainly should be addressed: lower urinary tract function, anorectal function, sexual function, gynaecological items, presence of pain and psychosocial aspects. One cannot state that there is a pelvic floor dysfunction based only on the history. But there is a suspicion of pelvic floor muscle dysfunction when two or more pelvic organs show dysfunction, for instance a combination of micturition and defecation problems.
