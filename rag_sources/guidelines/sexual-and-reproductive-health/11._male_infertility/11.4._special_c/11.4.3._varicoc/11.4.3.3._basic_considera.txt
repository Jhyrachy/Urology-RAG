11.4.3.3. basic considerations. 11.4.3.3.1. varicocele fertility varicocele present almost 15% normal male population, 25% men abnormal semen analysis 35-40% men presenting infertility [1522,1721-1723]. incidence varicocele among men primary infertility estimated 35–44%, whereas incidence men secondary infertility 45–81% . worsening semen parameters associated higher grade varicocele age . exact association reduced male fertility varicocele unknown. increased scrotal temperature, hypoxia reflux toxic metabolites cause testicular dysfunction infertility due increased overall survival dna damage . exact association reduced male fertility varicocele unknown. increased scrotal temperature, hypoxia reflux toxic metabolites cause testicular dysfunction infertility due increased . 11.4.3.3.2. varicocelectomy varicocele repair subject debate several decades. meta-analysis rcts observational studies men clinical varicoceles shown surgical varicocelectomy significantly improves semen parameters men abnormal semen parameters, including men noa hypo-spermatogenesis late maturation (spermatid) arrest testicular pathology [1721,1725-1728]. meta-analysis showed improvements semen parameters usually observed surgical correction men abnormal semen parameters . varicocelectomy also reverse sperm dna damage improve os levels . pain resolution varicocelectomy occurs 48-90% patients . systematic review shown greater improvement higher-grade varicoceles taken account patient counselling . rcts, varicocele repair men subclinical varicocele ineffective increasing chances spontaneous pregnancy . also, randomised studies included mainly men normal semen parameters benefit found favour treatment observation. also reported systematic review meta-analysis including prospective randomised non-randomised studies . studies including patients abnormal semen parameters pregnancy rates (or 1.29, 95% ci 1.00–1.65, p = 0.04) total sperm count (mean difference: 12.34 million/ml, 95% ci 3.49–21.18, p = 0.006) significantly improved varicocele treatment compared observation. benefit varicocele treatment found sperm progressive motility normal sperm morphology . pre- versus post-treatment values considered varicocele treatment arm benefit terms sperm count, progressive motility, normal morphology found . another systematic review meta-analysis evaluated change conventional semen parameters varicocele repair (n=1,426) compared untreated controls (n=996) . significantly improved post-operative semen parameters reported treated patients compared controls regards sperm concentration (smd 1.73; 95% ci 1.12 2.34; p<0.001), total sperm count (smd 1.89; 95% ci 0.56 3.22; p < 0.05), progressive sperm motility (smd 3.30; 95% ci 2.16 4.43; p < 0.01), total sperm motility (smd 0.88; 95% ci 0.03 1.73; p=0.04) normal sperm morphology (smd 1.67; 95% ci 0.87 2.47; p < 0.05) . cochrane review 2012 concluded evidence suggest treatment varicocele men couples otherwise unexplained subfertility may improve couple’s chance spontaneous pregnancy . similarly, cochrane review 2021 including 5,384 participants showed varicocele treatment may improve pregnancy rates compared delayed treatment (rr 1.55, 95% ci 1.06 2.26) . two meta-analyses rcts comparing treatment observation men clinical varicocele, oligozoospermia otherwise unexplained infertility, favoured treatment, combined 2.39-4.15 (95% ci: 1.56-3.66) (95% ci: 2.31-7.45), respectively . average time improvement semen parameters two spermatogenic cycles spontaneous pregnancy occurring six twelve months varicocelectomy . meta-analysis reported varicocelectomy may improve outcomes following art oligozoospermic men 1.69 (95% ci: 0.95-3.02) . 11.4.3.3.3. prophylactic varicocelectomy adolescents varicocele, significant risk over-treatment adolescents varicocele problem achieving pregnancy later life . prophylactic treatment advised case documented testicular growth deterioration confirmed serial clinical doppler us examinations and/or abnormal semen analysis . varicocelectomy noa several non-randomised studies suggested varicocelectomy may lead sperm appearing ejaculate men azoospermia. one study, microsurgical varicocelectomy men noa led sperm ejaculate post-operatively increase ensuing natural assisted pregnancies . meta-analyses corroborated findings; 468 patients diagnosed noa varicocele underwent surgical varicocele repair percutaneous embolisation. patients underwent varicocelectomy, srrs increased compared without varicocele repair (or: 2.65; 95% ci: 1.69-4.14; p < 0.001). 43.9% patients (range: 20.8%-55.0%), sperm found post-operative ejaculate. findings indicate varicocelectomy patients noa clinical varicocele associated improved srr, sperm retrieval may avoided sperm reappear ejaculate following varicocelectomy. 1397256787however, quality evidence available low risks benefits varicocele repair must discussed fully patient noa clinically significant varicocele prior embarking upon treatment intervention . current understanding underlying genetic defects noa must taken account interpreting contemporary literature. varicocelectomy hypogonadism evidence also suggests men clinical varicoceles hypogonadal may benefit varicocele intervention. one meta-analysis studied efficacy varicocele intervention comparing pre-operative post-operative serum testosterone 712 men. combined analysis seven studies demonstrated mean post-operative serum testosterone improved 34.3 ng/dl (95% ci: 22.57-46.04, p < 0.00001, i² = 0%) compared pre-operative levels. analysis surgery vs. untreated control results showed mean testosterone among hypoganadal patients increased 105.65 ng/dl (95% ci: 77.99-133.32 ng/dl), favouring varicocelectomy . however, results must treated caution adequate cost-benefit analysis must undertaken determine risks benefits surgical intervention testosterone therapy setting. although, varicocelectomy may offered hypogonadal men clinically significant varicoceles, patients must advised full benefits treatment setting must evaluated prospective rcts. 11.4.3.3.4. varicocelectomy assisted reproductive technology raised sdf varicocelectomy improve sperm dna integrity . systematic review meta-analysis analysed data 1,070 infertile men clinical varicocele showed varicocelectomy associated reduced post-operative sdf rates (weighted mean difference 7.23%; 95% ci: 8.86 5.59) . improvement dna integrity independent assay used (scsa vs. tunel vs. scd) surgical technique performed. estimated weighted mean difference greater studies pre-operative mean fragmentation index ≥ 20% studies sdf < 20%, suggesting varicocelectomy might beneficial men elevated baseline sdf values . magnitude effect size increased function preoperative sdf levels (coefficient: 0.23; 95%ci: 0.07 0.39). increasing evidence varicocele treatment may improve dna fragmentation outcomes art . consequence, recently suggested indications varicocele intervention expanded include men raised dna fragmentation. patient failed art (e.g., failure implantation, embryogenesis recurrent pregnancy loss) argument dna damage raised, consideration could given varicocele intervention extensive counselling , exclusion causes raised sdf .the dilemma remains whether varicocele treatment indicated men raised sdf normal semen parameters. decision would need full open discussion infertile couple, taking consideration female partners ovarian reserve surgical risks potential delays art associated varicocele intervention. meta-analysis non-azoospermic infertile men clinical varicocele estevez et al., four retrospective studies included men undergoing icsi, included 870 cycles (438 subjected icsi prior varicocelectomy, 432 without prior varicocelectomy). significant increase clinical pregnancy rates (or 1.59, 95% ci: 1.19-2.12, i2 = 25%) live birth rates (or 2.17, 95% ci: 1.55-3.06, i2 = 0%) varicocelectomy group compared group subjected icsi without previous varicocelectomy . study evaluated effects varicocele repair impact pregnancy live birth rates infertile couples undergoing art male partners oligo-azoospermia azoospermia varicocele . 1,241 patients, meta-analysis demonstrated varicocelectomy improved live birth rates oligospermic (or = 1.699) men combined oligo-azoospermic/azoospermic groups (or = 1.761). pregnancy rates higher azoospermic group (or = 2.336) combined oligo-azoospermic/azoospermic groups (or 1.760). live birth rates higher patients undergoing iui intervention (or 8.360).
