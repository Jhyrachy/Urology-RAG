3.2. Comorbidities associated with male hypogonadism. 3.2.1. Obesity Low testosterone levels are common in men with obesity. Male hypogonadism is associated with a greater percentage of fat mass and a lower lean mass compared to men with adequate testosterone levels [25,26]. Low levels of testosterone are strongly linked to heightened visceral adiposity. Additionally, they result in lipid accumulation in the liver and muscle, correlating with atherosclerosis [25,26]. 3.2.2. Metabolic Syndrome/Type 2 Diabetes Hypogonadism is frequently associated with MetS or its related components, including central obesity, hyperglycaemia, insulin resistance and dyslipidaemia and arterial hypertension [27]. Several randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have demonstrated that testosterone therapy may improve insulin resistance and hyperglycaemia and lower total and low-density protein (LDL) cholesterol [28-33]. Testosterone therapy in hypogonadal T2DM improved glycaemic control in some RCTs and registry trials; however, there is no conclusive evidence [29,34,35]. A large placebo-controlled RCT, including 1,007 patients with impaired glucose tolerance or newly-diagnosed T2DM and total testosterone < 14 nmol/L showed that testosterone therapy for two years reduced the proportion of patients with T2DM regardless of a lifestyle programme [33]. Similarly, a registry study reported that testosterone therapy was associated in time with remission of T2DM [34]. High-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol may decrease, remain unchanged or increase with testosterone therapy. Testosterone therapy in men with MetS and low testosterone has been shown to reduce mortality compared to untreated men [36,37], although no conclusive evidence is available. Erectile dysfunction (ED) is common in men with MetS and T2DM (up to 70% of patients). The causes of ED are multi-factorial and 30% of men with ED have co-existing testosterone-deficiency/hypogonadism. Some evidence has suggested that ED is only found in men with T2DM and clearly reduced testosterone levels(< 8 nmol/L or 2.31 ng/mL) [38]. From a pathophysiological perspective, it has been reported that this is because ED is predominantly caused by vascular and neuropathic disease, and therefore not likely in men who do not have established vascular disease. Therefore, men presenting with ED should be screened for MetS. Likewise, patients with ED and diabetes may be offered testosterone measurement. Placebo-controlled RCTs of testosterone therapy in T2DM have demonstrated improved sexual desire and satisfaction, although data on erectile function were limited [29,38]. Similar results were derived from a meta-analysis of published trials [39]. Accordingly, a large two-year RCT of testosterone undecanoate vs. placebo showed that testosterone therapy significantly improved sexual function and ED in men with impaired glucose tolerance or newly-diagnosed T2DM low testosterone (< 14 nmol/L) [33]. Testosterone therapy has been associated with a reduced percentage of body fat and increase in lean body mass [40]. Data from a registry study have suggested that testosterone therapy with long-acting intramuscular testosterone undecanoate over eleven years was associated with a substantial but gradual loss of weight, along with a reduction in waist circumference [41] 3.2.3. Sars-CoV-2 / COVID-19 Data seem to suggest that low circulating testosterone levels are more frequently associated with worse clinical outcomes in men with COVID-19 [42-49]. Accordingly, a cohort study, analysing two large academic health systems databases, including 723 men with a history of COVID-19 reported that hypogonadal men had a higher risk of being hospitalised [50]. In addition, a meta-analysis suggested that reduced testosterone levels detected at hospital admission for COVID-19 are associated with a four- five-fold increased risk of being admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or dying, after adjustment for potential confounders [51]. Although no information on the role of testosterone therapy in the acute phase of the disease is available currently, data also showed that the hypogonadal patients under testosterone therapy had a reduced risk to be hospitalised after SARS-CoV-2 infection [50]. However, whether or not low testosterone can directly contribute to worse COVID-19 outcomes is still under investigation. The possibility that low testosterone in the acute phase of COVID-19 infection represents an adaptive response mechanism to dampen non-essential activities non conducive to recovery (physical and sexual activities) by turning off testosterone-dependent functions, cannot be excluded [52,53]. Accordingly, a meta-analysis showed that secondary or mixed hypogonadism is more frequently observed in the acute phase of the infection [51]. Studies evaluating patients in the recovery phase of COVID-19 have documented either restored [54,55] or persistently low testosterone levels in the majority of cases [56]. A longitudinal evaluation study showed that during the recovery phase a further improvement of testosterone levels can be observed up to twelve months after COVID-19. Male subjects who have recovered from COVID-19 should be accurately followed-up to exclude any long-term andrological consequences including impairment in sperm and testosterone production [51].
