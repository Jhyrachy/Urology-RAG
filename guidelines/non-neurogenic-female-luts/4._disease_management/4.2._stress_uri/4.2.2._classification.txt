4.2.2. Classification. Patients with SUI can be classified as uncomplicated and complicated [286]. The Panel has reached a consensus on the definition to be used throughout this guideline document: Women with uncomplicated SUI: no prior surgery for SUI, extensive pelvic surgery, or pelvic radiotherapy; no neurogenic LUT dysfunction; no bothersome genitourinary prolapse; absence of voiding symptoms; and no medical conditions that affect the LUT. In cases where additional significant storage symptoms, especially OAB, are present, consider a possible diagnosis of MUI (see Section 4.3).Women with complicated SUI: previous surgery for incontinence or extensive pelvic surgery; history of pelvic irradiation; presence of anterior or apical POP; presence of voiding symptoms or neurogenic LUT dysfunction; significant OAB/UUI; congenital abnormalities such as bladder exstrophy. Neurogenic LUT dysfunction is reviewed in the EAU Guidelines on Neuro-Urology and will not be considered further in these guidelines [9]. The treatment of LUTS associated with genitourinary prolapse has been included in these guidelines (see Section 4.7).
