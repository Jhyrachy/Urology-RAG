7.1.3.2. Partial nephrectomy techniques. 7.1.3.2.1. Open versus laparoscopic approach Studies comparing laparoscopic and open PN found no difference in PFS [319-322] and OS [321,322] in centres with laparoscopic expertise. However, the oncological safety of laparoscopic vs. open PN has, so far, only been addressed in studies with relatively limited follow-up [323]. However, the higher number of patients treated with open surgery in this series might reflect a selection bias by offering laparoscopic surgery in case of a less complex anatomy [323]. The mean estimated blood loss was found to be lower with the laparoscopic approach [319,321,324], while post-operative mortality, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism events were similar [319,321]. Operative time is generally longer with the laparoscopic approach [320,322] and warm ischaemia time is shorter with the open approach [319,321,324,325]. The results for GFR decline are debatable, an RCT reported greater 3-12 months kidney function reduction in the open group [326] whilst in a matched-pair comparison, GFR decline was greater in the laparoscopic PN group in the immediate post-operative period [322], but not after 3.6 years follow-up. In another comparative study, the surgical approach was not an independent predictor for post-operative CKD [325]. Retroperitoneal and transperitoneal laparoscopic PN have similar peri-operative outcomes [327]. Simple tumour enucleation also had similar PFS and CSS rates compared to standard PN and RN in a large study [328]. The feasibility of laparo-endoscopic single-site PN has been shown in selected patients, but larger studies are needed to confirm its safety and clinical role [329]. 7.1.3.2.2. Open versus robotic approach One study prospectively compared the peri-operative outcomes of a series of robot-assisted and open PN performed by the same experienced surgeon. Robot-assisted PN was superior to open PN in terms of lower estimated blood loss and shorter hospital stay. Warm ischaemia time, operative time, immediate- early- and short-term complications, variation in creatinine levels and pathologic margins were similar between groups [330]. A multicentre French prospective database compared the outcomes of 1,800 patients who underwent open PN and robot-assisted PN. Although the follow-up was shorter, there was a decreased morbidity in the robot-assisted PN group with less overall complications, less major complications, less transfusions and a much shorter hospital stay [331]. A SR and meta-analysis comparing RAPN and OPN demonstrated similar short-term functional outcomes, however results are inconsistent [332]. OPERA, a prospective RCT comparing open (OPN) vs. robotic partial nephrectomy (RAPN) in intermediate/high complexity renal tumours (RENAL Score > = 7) prematurely closed due to poor accrual and data have not been fully published [333]. The single-centre, open-label feasibility ROBOCOP II RCT enrolled patients with suspected localised RCC referred for PN and randomised them at a 1:1 ratio to either RAPN or OPN [334]. The primary outcome was the feasibility of recruitment, assessed as the accrual rate. Secondary outcomes included perioperative and post-operative data. Overall, 50 patients underwent RAPN or OPN (accrual rate 65%). In comparison to OPN, RAPN had lower blood loss, less need for opioids, and fewer complications according to the mean Comprehensive Complication Index. OPN has a shorter operative time and warm ischemia time. There were no differences between RAPN and OPN regarding post-operative functional outcomes. Considering the limitations of both prospective trials, the clinical impact of robotic PN is still controversial. 7.1.3.2.3. Open versus hand-assisted approach Hand-assisted laparoscopic PN (HALPN) is rarely performed. A comparative study of open vs. HALPN showed no difference in OS or RFS at intermediate-term follow-up. The authors observed a lower rate of intra-operative and all-grade post-operative 30-day complications in HALPN vs. open PN patients, but there was no significant difference in high Clavien grade complications. Three months after the operation, GFR was lower in the HALPN than in the open PN group [335]. 7.1.3.2.4. Open versus laparoscopic versus robotic approaches In a retrospective propensity-score-matched study, comparing open-, laparoscopic- and robot-assisted PN, after five years of median follow-up, similar rates of local recurrence, distant metastasis and cancer-related death rates were found [336]. 7.1.3.2.5. Laparoscopic versus robotic approach Another study included the 50 last patients having undergone laparoscopic and robotic PN for T1-T2 renal tumours by two different surgeons with an experience of over 200 procedures each in laparoscopic and robotic PN and RAPN, respectively, at the beginning of the study. Peri-operative and short-term oncological and functional outcomes appeared broadly comparable between RAPN and LPN when performed by highly experienced surgeons [337]. A meta-analysis, including a series of NSS with variable methodological quality compared the peri-operative outcomes of robot-assisted- and laparoscopic PN. The robotic group had a significantly lower rate of conversion to open surgery and to radical surgery, shorter warm ischaemia time, smaller change in estimated GFR after surgery and shorter length of hospital stay. No significant differences were observed between the two groups regarding complications, change of serum creatinine after surgery, operative time, estimated blood loss and positive surgical margins (PSMs) [338]. A multi-institutional prospective study of 105 patients with hilar tumours demonstrated a reduced warm ischaemia time (20.2 min vs. 27.7 min) and a comparable rate of 1.9% when compared with a historical laparoscopic control group which was defined by literature research and meta-analysis for warm ischaemia time and PSM, respectively [339]. 7.1.3.2.6. Laparoscopic transperitoneal versus retroperitoneal approach Data from the Italian RECORD 2 project, a multi-institutional prospective observational project, compared the transperitoneal vs. the retroperitoneal approach for laparoscopic PN. After propensity score matching (each group n = 413) no differences in post-operative complications (surgical and medical), PSMs, early and late eGFR levels were observed. Intra-operative and surgical complications were slightly higher and operative times lower in the transperitoneal vs. the retroperitoneal approach [340]. In terms of peri-operative complications, retroperitoneal and transperitoneal PN have similar outcomes [327]. A SR assessed the outcomes of retroperitoneal vs. transperitoneal RAPN. Seventeen studies, published between 2013 and 2021, were retrieved; none of which an RCT. Among the 6,266 patients included 2,261 (36.1%) and 4,005 (63.9%) underwent retroperitoneal vs. transperitoneal RAPN, respectively. Both retroperitoneal and transperitoneal RAPN offered similar surgical outcomes, while retroperitoneal RAPN was associated with shorter surgical time and length of hospital stay [341]. 7.1.3.2.7. Tumour enucleation, standard partial nephrectomy and single-port approach Simple tumour enucleation also had similar PFS and CSS rates compared to standard PN and RN in a large study [328]. The feasibility of laparo-endoscopic single-site PN has been shown in selected patients but larger studies are needed to confirm its safety and clinical role [329]. The only prospective multi-centre study available to date assessing the impact of resection technique (enucleation vs. enucleoresection vs. resection) during PN using a standardised reporting score to classify the resection technique after surgery found that the resection technique significantly impacts surgical complications, early functional outcomes and positive surgical margins after PN of localised renal masses [342]. A SR and pooled analysis found heterogeneity in the reporting of resection techniques across robotic PN series [343]. Out of 20 studies retrieved, nine compared “standard” resection versus enucleation. A pooled analysis did not reveal significant differences in terms of operative time, ischemia time, blood loss, transfusions, or positive margins. Significant differences favoring enucleation were found for clamping management (odds ratio [OR] for renal artery clamping 3.51, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.13-10.88; p = 0.03), overall complications (OR for occurrence 0.55, 95% CI 0.34-0.87; p = 0.01) major complications (OR for occurrence 0.39, 95% CI 0.19-0.79; p = 0.009), length of stay (weighted mean difference [WMD] -0.72 d, 95% CI -0.99 to -0.45; p < 0.001), and decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate (WMD -2.64 ml/min, 95% CI -5.15 to -0.12; p = 0.04). 7.1.3.2.8. Off-clamp versus On-clamp PN The use of a off-clamp and selective-clamping approaches for PN has increased in recent years with the aim to minimise/avoid warm ischemia time and improve functional outcomes. One RCT (CLOCK study) showed a comparable safety profile of off-clamp vs. on-clamp PN in terms of intra- and peri-operative complications as well as comparable absolute eGFR variation and split renal function at 6 months from surgery in patients with regular baseline function and two kidneys. However, 40% of the patients randomised in the off-clamp group, were intraoperatively shifted to on-clamp (median ischemia time of 15 minutes) [344,345]. Due to the selective inclusion criteria of the RCT, off-clamp techniques may still be indicated in patients with chronic kidney disease, single kidney or multifocal disease [346,347]. In a contemporary cohort of 1359 patients from the prospectively maintained database of the French national network of research on kidney cancer (UROCCR), PSM rate was not statistically different between the off-clamp group (5.6%) and the on-clamp group (11%) (p = 0.1). With short median follow-up, no statistical differences between the two groups were seen in OS, local RFS and metastasis-free survival (MFS) [348]. 7.1.3.2.9. Surgical volume In a analysis of 8,753 patients who underwent PN, an inverse non-linear relationship of hospital volume with morbidity of PN was observed, with a plateauing seen at 35-40 cases per year overall, and 18-20 cases for the robotic approach [349]. A retrospective study of a U.S. National Cancer Database looked at the prognostic impact of hospital volume and the outcomes of robot-assisted PN, including 18,724 cases. This study showed that undergoing RAPN at higher-volume hospitals may have better peri-operative outcomes (conversion to open and length of hospital stay) and lower PSM rates [350]. A French study, including 1,222 RAPN patients, has shown that hospital volume is the main predictive factor of Trifecta achievement (no complications, warm ischaemia time < 25 min, and negative surgical margins) after adjustment for other variables, including surgeon volume [351]. The prospective Registry of Conservative and Radical Surgery for cortical renal tumour Disease (RECORd-2) study including 2,076 patients showed that the hospital volume (> 60 PN/year) is an independent predictor for PSMs [352]. 7.1.3.2.10. Pre-operative embolisation prior to partial nephrectomy A SR and meta-analysis of 270 patients demonstrated significantly reduced blood loss in patients with selective renal artery embolisation (n = 222; 154 ± 22.6 mL vs. n = 48; 353.4 ± 69.6 mL) prior to PN [353].
