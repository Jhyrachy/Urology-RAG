9.3.2.2. Surgical treatment of congenital intrinsic penile shortness. Current literature reports a wide spectrum of possible surgical interventions aimed to address penile shortness. Nonetheless, the proposed spectrum of surgical interventions starts from less invasive procedures - such as suspensory ligament release (SLR) - to more complex genital reconstruction - such as total phallic reconstruction (TPR) [1278,1279]. 9.3.2.2.1. Suspensory ligament release (SLR) This technique involves a surgical incision and SLR of the penis which attaches the penis to the pubic bone. The surgical access is via an infrapubic incision and may be combined with an elongating V-Y skin plasty [1279]. Several authors reported outcomes of SLR in the context of a congenital intrinsic penile shortness (Table 29).

Ventral phalloplasty/scrotoplasty This intervention is based on a ventral shaft skin plasty to move the peno-scrotal angle proximally and increase the exposure of the penile shaft. A longitudinal incision or Z-plasty at the penoscrotal junction, securing the tunica albuginea to the proximal tunica dartos was performed by Xu et al. in 41 patients [1281]. The correction was successful in all patients with an improved median length of +2.1 cm in the flaccid state. 9.3.2.2.3. Suprapubic lipoplasty/liposuction/lipectomy This intervention aims to reduce the thickness of the suprapubic fat pad either with a minimally invasive approach (liposuction) or surgically (lipectomy). The flattening of the suprapubic fat pad aims to increase penile shaft exposure. Ghanem et al., performed liposuction in ten patients using a 50-cc syringe with a 3- and 6-mm liposuction needle [1195]. The amount of fat removed ranged from 325 to 850 mL with a mean of 495.50 ± 155.39 mL. Three (30%) of the patients were very satisfied with the post-operative result, five (50%) patients were satisfied, one patient (10%) was neither satisfied nor dissatisfied, and one (10%) patient was dissatisfied. No patients were very dissatisfied. Shaeer’s monsplasty technique was investigated in 20 patients [1282]. At three months post-operatively, the flaccid visible length was 7.1 ± 2.1cm, with a 57.9% improvement in length, and the erect visible length was 11.8 ± 2.1cm, with a 32% improvement in length. At final follow-up (eighteen months) a 73.1% improvement in satisfaction rate was detected. 9.3.2.2.4. Total phallic reconstruction (TPR) This represents the most complex genital reconstruction possible, aiming to create a new phallus with a neo-urethra. The operation is reserved for severe penile insufficiency cases (e.g., congenital micropenis, exstrophy-epispadias complex) as the benefit should be balanced over possible complications [1278]. Lumen et al., treated seven male patients (aged 15 to 42 years) with phalloplasty (6 with radial forearm free flap and 1 with anterolateral thigh flap) and implant surgery was offered approximately 1 year after the phallic reconstruction [1283]. There were no complications after surgical formation of the neophallus. Two complications were reported in the early post-operative period. Two patients developed urinary complications (stricture and/or fistula). Patient satisfaction after surgery was high in six cases and moderate in one case. Four patients underwent penile implant surgery and 50% were subsequently removed. Perovic et al., conducted TPR using musculocutaneous latissimus dorsi (MLD) in twelve patients [1284]. The mean (range) follow-up was 31 (6–74) months, and the penile size was 16 (14–18) cm long and 13 (11–15) cm in circumference. There was no flap loss or partial skin necrosis. Garaffa et al., reported a series of TPR using the radial artery forearm free flap in 16 patients with bladder/cloacal exstrophy and micropenis-epispadias complex [1285]. In one patient the distal third of the phallus was lost due to acute thrombosis of the arterial anastomosis immediately post-operatively. Almost all (93%) were fully satisfied in terms of cosmesis and size. Urethral stricture and fistula were the most common complications, which developed only at the native neourethral anastomosis. They were successfully managed by revision surgery. Sexual intercourse was achieved in 11 of the 12 patients who underwent PPI. 9.3.2.2.5. Summary of evidence and recommendations for surgical treatment of congenital intrinsic penile shortness Summary of evidenceLEConsidering the wide spectrum and the complexity of surgical interventions aimed at addressing penile shortness, this surgery should be reserved to high volume centres.4Suspensory ligament release, ventral phalloplasty and suprapubic lipoplasty/liposuction/lipectomy provide an objective increase in penile length.3Suspensory ligament release, ventral phalloplasty and suprapubic lipoplasty/liposuction/lipectomy are associated with a significant incidence of complications.3Total phallic reconstruction provides satisfactory surgical and functional outcomes in men with micropenis.3 RecommendationsStrength ratingPerform penile augmentation surgery in high-volume centres.StrongUse suspensory ligament release (SLR), ventral phalloplasty and suprapubic lipoplasty/liposuction/lipectomy to address penile lengthening.WeakExtensively discuss possible complications related to suspensory ligament release, ventral phalloplasty and suprapubic lipoplasty/liposuction/lipectomy.StrongUse total phallic reconstruction to restore genital anatomy in patients affected by congenital micropenis.Weak
