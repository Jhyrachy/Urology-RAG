8.1. Introduction. Quality of life and personalised care go hand in hand. Treating PCa can affect an individual both physically and mentally, as well as close relations and work or vocation. These multifaceted issues all have a bearing on an individual‘s perception of QoL [1342,1343]. Approaching care from a holistic point of view requires the intervention of a multi-disciplinary team including urologists, medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, oncology nurses, behavioural practitioners and many others including fellow patients. Attention to the psychosocial concerns of people with PCa is integral to quality clinical care, and this can include the needs of carers and partners [1344]. Prostate cancer care should not be reduced to focusing on the organ in isolation: side effects or late adverse effects of treatment can manifest systemically and have a major influence on the patient’s QoL. Psychological distress can be caused by the cancer diagnosis itself, cancer symptoms and/or treatment side effects [1345]. Taking QoL into consideration relies on understanding the patient’s values and preferences so that optimal treatment proposals can be formulated and discussed. Cross-sectional patient reported outcomes studies in general PCa populations show the impact of treatment on global and disease specific QoL is greater than that described in clinical trial populations who often have less co-morbidity and belong to higher socio-economic groups. Individuals undergoing two or more treatments have more symptoms and greater impact on QoL [1346,1347]. Subgroups of people including those with poor general health, being unmarried, older age and/or pre-existing depressive symptoms are more at risk of long-term mental health issues following treatment for PCa [1348].
