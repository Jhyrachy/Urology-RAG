3.8.1. Introduction. Catheter-associated UTI refers to UTIs occurring in a person whose urinary tract is currently catheterised or has been catheterised within the past 48 hours. The urinary catheter literature is problematic as many published studies use the term CA-bacteriuria without providing information on what proportion are CA-ABU and CA-UTI, and some studies use the term CA-UTI when referring to CA-ABU or CA-bacteriuria [235].
