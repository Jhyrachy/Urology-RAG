7.4.4.1. Treatment-naïve patients with clear-cell metastatic RCC. The combination of pembrolizumab plus axitinib as well as nivolumab plus cabozantinib and lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab is the standard of care in all IMDC-risk patients and ipilimumab plus nivolumab in IMDC intermediate- and poor-risk patients (Figure 7.1). Therefore, the role of VEGFR-TKIs alone in front-line mRCC has been superseded in IMDC intermidiate and poor risk. In IMDC Favorable group, in the absence of OS benefit both options are acceptable. Sunitinib, pazopanib, and cabozantinib (IMDC intermediate- and poor-risk disease), remain alternative treatment options for patients who cannot receive or tolerate immune checkpoint inhibition in this setting (Figure 7.1). 7.4.4.1.1. Sequencing systemic therapy in clear-cell metastatic RCC The sequencing of targeted therapies is established in mRCC and maximises outcomes [548,560]. Pembrolizumab plus axitinib, nivolumab plus cabozantinib, lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab and nivolumab plus ipilimumab are the new standard of care in front-line therapy in IMDC intermediate/poor. The impact of front-line immune checkpoint inhibition on subsequent therapies is unclear. Randomised data on patients with disease refractory to either nivolumab plus ipilimumab or TKI plus IO in a first-line setting are limited. Sequencing immune checkpoint inhibition with atezolizumab did not demonstrate ORR, PFS , OS benefit over single agent TKI in the CONTACT 03 [582,583]. Prospective data on cabozantinib, tivozanib, and axitinib are available for patients progressing on immunotherapy, but these studies do not focus solely on the front-line setting, involve subset analyses, and are too small for definitive conclusions [560,584]. The use of mTOR inhibitors can be considered in VEGF-targeted therapy refractory disease but has been outperformed by other VEGF-targeted therapies in mRCC and belzutifan [585]. Drug choice in the third-line setting, after immune checkpoint inhibitor combinations and subsequent VEGF-targeted therapy, is unknown. The Panel recommends a subsequent agent which is approved in VEGF-refractory disease, with the exception of re-challenge with immune checkpoint blockade. Cabozantinib is the only agent in VEGF-refractory disease with RCT data showing a survival advantage and should be used preferentially [518]. Axitinib has positive PFS data in VEGF- refractory disease. Both sorafenib and everolimus have been outperformed by other agents in VEGF-refractory disease and are therefore less attractive [585]. The lenvatinib plus everolimus combination appears superior to everolimus alone and has been granted EMA regulatory approval based on randomised phase II data. This is an alternative despite the availability of phase II data only [548]. As shown in a study which also included patients on ICIs, tivozanib provides PFS superiority over sorafenib in VEGF-refractory disease [586]. 7.4.4.1.2.

Re-challenge with immunotherapy requires expert support.4Patients who do not receive the full four doses of ipilimumab due to toxicity should continue on single-agent nivolumab, where safe and feasible. Re-challenge with combination therapy requires expert support.4Treatment past progression can be justified but requires close scrutiny and the support of an expert multidisciplinary team.1bNivolumab plus ipilimumab was associated with 46% grade III-IV toxicity and 1.5% treatment-related deaths. Tyrosine kinase inhibitor-based IO combination therapies were associated with grade III-V toxicity ranging between 61-72% and 1% of treatment-related deaths.1bIn the CONTACT 3 study atezolizomab plus cabozantinib offer no benefit compared to cabozantinib alone in patients who’s cancers have previously progressed on immune checkpoint inhibition therapy.1bCabozantinib as a single agent has the most robust data after first line PD1 based combination therapy.3 RecommendationsStrength ratingFirst line Treatment for metastatic clear cell RCC patientsOffer treatment with PD1 combinations in centres with experience.WeakOffer nivolumab plus ipilimumab, pembrolizumab plus axitinib, lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab or nivolumab and cabozantinib to patients with International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium (IMDC) intermediate- or poor risk-disease.StrongOffer pembrolizumab plus axitinib, lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab or nivolumab and cabozantinib or sunitinib or pazopanib for IMDC favourable risk disease.WeakOffer sunitinib or pazopanib to patients with any IMDC risk who cannot receive or tolerate immune checkpoint inhibition.StrongOffer cabozantinib to patients with IMDC intermediate- and poor-risk clear cell metastatic renal carcinoma (cc-mRCC) who cannot receive or tolerate immune checkpoint inhibition.StrongaPatients who do not receive the full four doses of ipilimumab due to toxicity should continue on single-agent nivolumab, where safe and feasible.

Renal tumours with sarcomatoid features Subset analyses have shown improved results for PD-L1 inhibitors combined with CTLA4 or VEGF-targeted therapy in renal tumours with sarcomatoid features. Ipilimumab/nivolumab, axitinib/pembrolizumab and lenvatinib/pembrolizumab avelumab/axitinib can all be recommended instead of VEFG-targeted therapy alone. These options have OS advantages over sunitinib and superseded VEGF-targeted therapy. Nivolumab/Ipilimumab provided post hoc analysis demonstrating ORR of 61%, including 23% CR rate, PFS and OS benefit over sunitinb (HR 0.50 and OS HR 0.46 respectively with median OS 48.6 vs 14.2 month [587].
