3.4. Molecular background of UTUCs. A number of studies focusing on molecular classification have been able to demonstrate genetically distinct groups of UTUC by evaluating DNA, RNA and protein expression. The most common genomic alterations included FGFR3, chromatin remodelling genes (i.e., KMT2D and KDM6A), TP53/MDM2, and other typical tumour suppressors/oncogenes such as CDKN2A or RAS [79]. Low-grade tumours are enriched for activating FGFR3 mutations (> 90% tumours) and depleted of TP53/MDM2 mutations, whereas high-grade tumours often show mutations in TP53 signalling [80]. It has also been shown that UTUC has a T-cell depleted immune contexture and activated FGFR3 signalling [81]. Five different molecular subtypes with different gene expression, tumour location and outcome have been identified, but, as yet, it is unclear whether these subtypes will respond differently to treatment and therefore, these subtypes have limited use in daily practice [82].
