8.2.3.1.1. Oral treatment. Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors were first suggested as a treatment for PD in 2003 to reduce collagen deposition and increase apoptosis through the inhibition of transforming growth factor (TGF)-b1 [892-894]. The results of a retrospective study of 65 men indicated that treatment with tadalafil was helpful in decreasing helped decrease curvature and remodel septal scars when compared to controls [895]. Another study concluded that sildenafil was able to improve erectile function and pain in PD patients. Thirty-nine patients with PD were divided into two groups receiving vitamin E (400 IU) or sildenafil 50 mg for twelve weeks with significantly better outcomes in pain and mean IIEF scores were seen in the sildenafil group [896]. Findings from a observational retrospective study including patients in the acute phase of PD and ED who had been treated with Tadalafil 5 mg once daily compared to patients with comparable baseline parameters who decided not to take the daily compound (i.e., 108 intervention vs. 83 controls) showed that treated men had lower curvature progression rates at 12 weeks (25.9% vs. 39.7%, p = 0.042) [897]. Similarly, mean SHIM score and PDQ-Overall and PDQ-Penile Pain scores significantly improved in the intervention group (p < 0.001). Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may be offered to patients in active-phase PD to ameliorate penile pain. Pain levels should be periodically reassessed whilst monitoring treatment efficacy.
