3.7.4. Diagnostic evaluation. Most hypospadias patients are easily diagnosed at birth (except for the megameatus intact prepuce variant which can only be seen after retraction of foreskin). Diagnosis includes a description of the local findings: position, shape and width of the orifice;presence of atretic urethra and division of corpus spongiosum;appearance of the preputial hood and scrotum;size of the penis;curvature of the penis on erection. The diagnostic evaluation also includes an assessment of associated anomalies, which are: cryptorchidism (in up to 10% of cases of hypospadias);open processus vaginalis or inguinal hernia (in 9-15%). Severe hypospadias with unilaterally or bilaterally impalpable testis, or with ambiguous genitalia, requires a complete genetic and endocrine work-up immediately after birth to exclude DSD, especially congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Urine trickling and ballooning of the urethra requires exclusion of meatal stenosis. The relationship between the severity of the hypospadias and associated anomalies of the upper or lower urinary tract were not confirmed [314] (LE: 3).
