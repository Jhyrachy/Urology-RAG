may located within abdominal cavity. guidelines deal management cryptorchidism adults. 11.4.1.1. classification classification cryptorchidism based duration condition anatomical position testes. undescended testis identified birth termed congenital diagnosis acquired cryptorchidism refers men testes situated within scrotum. cryptorchidism categorised bilateral unilateral location testes (inguinal, intra-abdominal ectopic). studies shown treatment congenital acquired cryptorchidism results similar hormonal profiles, semen analysis testicular volumes . however, testicular volume hormonal function reduced adults treated congenital bilateral cryptorchidism compared unilateral cryptorchidism . 11.4.1.1.1.etiology pathophysiology postulated cryptorchidism may part so-called testicular dysgenesis syndrome (tds), developmental disorder gonads caused environmental and/or genetic influences early pregnancy, including exposure endocrine disrupting chemicals. besides cryptorchidism, tds includes hypospadias, reduced fertility, increased risk malignancy, leydig/sertoli cell dysfunction . cryptorchidism also linked maternal gestational smoking premature birth .
