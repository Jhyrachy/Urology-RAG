3.7.3. classification systems. hypospadias usually classified based anatomical location proximally displaced urethral orifice: distal-anterior hypospadias (located glans distal shaft penis commo type hypospadias);intermediate-middle (penile);proximal-posterior (penoscrotal, scrotal, perineal). pathology may different skin release reclassified accordingly. anatomical location meatus may always enough explain severity complex nature pathology. therefore, simple classification related severity problem, considers penile length, glans size, shape, urethral plate quality penile curvature commonly used. classification two types: mild hypospadias (glanular penile isolated hypospadias without associated chordee, micropenis scrotal anomaly); severe hypospadias (penoscrotal, perineal hypospadias associated chordee scrotal anomalies).
