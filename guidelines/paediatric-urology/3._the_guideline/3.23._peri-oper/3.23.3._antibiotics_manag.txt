3.23.3. Antibiotics management: general information. It is well established that peri-operative antibiotics prevent infections following surgery, but limited data are available for antibiotic management in paediatric genitourinary procedures. Antibiotic prophylaxis carried the risk of developing drug-resistant bacteria and adverse effects such as allergic reactions. Furthermore, in childhood some antibiotics are not recommended and their use is discouraged except for in severe cases. In 2020 Snyder et al., conducted one of the first systematic reviews on perioperative antibiotic practices in the paediatric urology literature [1569]. They reported that the majority of the articles did not provide accurate information on peri-operative antibiotic practices. Other studies demonstrated wide variations in practice patterns for antibiotic usage among paediatric urologists [356,1570]. Perioperative prophylactic antibiotics in hypospadias repair have been widely debated in the literature. A meta-analysis demonstrated a high risk of bias and a low level of evidence, in terms of postoperative prophylactic antibiotics preventing complications following hypospadias repair [359]. On the contrary, a consensus exists for no perioperative antibiotics following circumcision [1569]. A prospective, randomized, controlled, non-blinded, non-placebo study was performed on the effectiveness of continuous antibiotic prophylaxis in patients with JJ stents, with a total of 105 patients. They concluded that continuous antibiotic prophylaxis reduced the incidence of febrile UTIs, especially in children with a history of febrile UTI and LUTS [1571]. There is a need for standardization of perioperative antibiotic usage for paediatric urological operations, however, a lack of prospective studies and RCTâ€™s are the main barriers for creating evidence-based guidelines on this particular topic.
