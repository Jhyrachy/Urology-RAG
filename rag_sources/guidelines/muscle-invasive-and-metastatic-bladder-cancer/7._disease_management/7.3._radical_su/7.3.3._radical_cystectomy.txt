neurovascular bundles. 2. capsule sparing cystectomy: capsule peripheral part prostate preserved adenoma (including prostatic urethra) removed turp en bloc bladder. seminal vesicles, vas deferens neurovascular bundles also preserved. 3. seminal sparing cystectomy: seminal vesicles, vas deferens neurovascular bundles preserved. 4. nerve-sparing cystectomy: neurovascular bundles tissue left place. systematic review oncological functional outcomes sexual function-preserving cystectomy men indentified 12 studies (n = 1,098) . majority cases, open surgical approach used urinary diversion choice orthotopic neobladder. median follow-up longer three years nine studies, three studies presenting results median follow-up longer five years. majority studies included patients potent pre-operatively organ-confined disease without tumour bladder neck and/or prostatic urethra. prostate cancer ruled sexual- preserving cystectomy (spc) techniques, except nerve-sparing approach . oncological outcomes differ groups comparative studies measured local recurrence, metastatic recurrence, dss os, median follow-up three five years. techniques preserving prostatic tissue (prostate- capsule-sparing), rates incidental prostate cancer intervention group ranged 0–15%. incidental prostate cancer isup grade ≥ 4 reported. post-operative potency significantly better patients underwent type spc technique compared conventional rc (p < 0.05), ranging 80–90%, 50–100% 29–78% prostate-, capsule- nerve-sparing techniques, respectively. urinary continence, defined use ‘no pads’ majority studies, ranged 88–100% (day-time continence) 31–96% (night-time continence) prostate-sparing cystectomy patients. major differences seen regard continence rates approaches. evidence base suggest procedures may yield better sexual outcomes standard rc without compromising oncological outcomes. however, overall quality evidence moderate, hence spc technique offered, patients must carefully
