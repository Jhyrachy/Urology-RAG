3.1. Definition of penile cancer. More than 95% of penile cancers are SCCs. There are several recognised subtypes of penile SCC with different clinical features and natural history (see Table 3.1). Penile SCC usually arises from the epithelium of the inner prepuce or the glans. Table 3.1: Histological subtypes of penile carcinomas according to the 2020 WHO Classification  [8,9], frequency and outcomes (Modified from [10]) SubtypeFrequency (% of cases)Mortality (%)Other featuresHPV-independent SCCUsual45 – 7520 – 38Diagnosis of exclusion. Various degrees of differentiationPseudohyperplastic*< 10Well-differentiated, superficially spreading simulating pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasiaPseudoglandular*< 130Poorly-differentiated carcinoma with acantholytic pseudolumina simulating glandsVerrucous3 – 80Extremely well-differentiated, broad-based, and pushing tumour front. No metastasis reportedCuniculatum< 10Endophytic labyrinthine growth pattern with broad-based pushing margins.Papillary2 – 150 – 6Papillae covered by well- to moderately differentiated cells without koilocytesSarcomatoid1 -745 – 90Biphasic epithelial and spindle cell neoplasia. Most aggressive and worse prognosis.Mixed10 – 193 – 7Two or more subtypes in the same specimen. Prognosis is related to the subtypes involved.HPV-associatedBasaloid4 – 1021 – 67Uniform basaloid cells in nests or sheets, with comedonecrosis or abrupt keratinisation.Warty5 – 100 – 10Condylomatous papillae with central fibrovascular cores and koilocytes.Clear cell< 120 – 30Nests or sheets of cells with ample, clear cytoplasm with central of geographical necrosis.Lymphoepithelioma-like< 1UnknownPoorly differentiated cells intermixed with dense lymphoplasmacytic and eosinophilic infiltrate.Mixed4 - 1030 - 50Mainly Warty-basaloid carcinoma according to the WHO 2022.OthersSCC NOS (not-otherwise specified)UnknownUnknownKeratinizing carcinoma. This must be used only when evaluation of p16 is not available.Adenosquamous1 – 20–14Squamous tumour nests intermixed with a minor mucinous glandular component.MucoepidermoidUnknownUnknownClear separation between adenosquamous and mucoepidermoid is not provided in the WHO classification. Salivary glands criteria can be applied but there is no consensus. HPV = human papillomavirus; SCC = squamous cell carcinoma; WHO = World Health Organization.* WHO 2022 classification consider these subtypes part of usual SCC.** This is considered a variant of the cuniculatum carcinoma.
