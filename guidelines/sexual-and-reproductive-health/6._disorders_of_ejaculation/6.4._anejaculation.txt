6.4. Anejaculation. 6.4.1. Definition and classification Anejaculation involves the complete absence of antegrade or retrograde ejaculation. It is caused by the failure of semen emission from the seminal vesicles, prostate, and ejaculatory ducts into the urethra [748]. True anejaculation is usually associated with a normal orgasmic sensation and is always associated with central or peripheral nervous system dysfunction or with drugs [749]. 6.4.2. Pathophysiology and risk factors Generally, anejaculation shares similar aetiological factors with DE and retrograde ejaculation (Table 13). 6.4.3. Investigation and treatment Drug treatment for anejaculation caused by lymphadenectomy and neuropathy, or psychosexual therapy for anorgasmia, is not effective. In all these cases, and in men who have a spinal cord injury, PVS (i.e., application of a vibrator to the penis) is the first-line therapy. In anejaculation, PVS evokes the ejaculation reflex [750], which requires an intact lumbosacral spinal cord segment. If the quality of semen is poor or ejaculation is retrograde, the couple may enter an in vitro fertilisation program whenever fathering is desired. If PVS has failed, electro-ejaculation can be the therapy of choice [751]. Other sperm-retrieval techniques may be used when electro-ejaculation fails or cannot be carried out [752]. Anejaculation following either retroperitoneal surgery for testicular cancer or total mesorectal excision can be prevented using unilateral lymphadenectomy or autonomic nerve preservation [753], respectively.
