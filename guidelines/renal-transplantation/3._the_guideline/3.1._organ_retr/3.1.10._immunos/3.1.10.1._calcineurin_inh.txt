3.1.10.1. Calcineurin inhibitors. Both cyclosporine and tacrolimus have significant side effects that are hazardous to the graft and patient [243-250]. Most importantly, both are nephrotoxic [251,252], and long-term use is an important cause of chronic allograft dysfunction [253], eventually leading to graft loss or severe chronic kidney disease in recipients of non-renal organs. Both CNIs are considered to be ‘critical-dose‘ drugs, so that any deviations from exposure can lead to severe toxicity or failure of efficacy. Because of the narrow therapeutic window and the potential for drug-to-drug interaction, CNIs should be monitored using trough levels, which provide a reasonable estimate for exposure [250]. Meta-analysis of tacrolimus and cyclosporine has demonstrated similar outcomes with respect to overall patient and graft survival [243-249,254-256]. Tacrolimus provided better rejection prophylaxis and was associated with better graft survival, when censored for death in some analyses. Renal function was favourable for tacrolimus treated patients, in a number of number of trials [254,257-261]. Therefore, both CNIs can be used for the effective prevention of acute rejection, but due to higher efficacy tacrolimus is recommended by current guidelines as first-line CNI [244]. For both CNIs several different formulations are available [250,262-270]. Tacrolimus once-daily dosing seems to be preferred by patients and is associated with better adherence and lower pharmacokinetic variability [250,271,272]. Precautions (e.g. close surveillance and determination of drug levels) should be instituted after conversion from one formulation to another [270,273-277]. In case of specific side effects of a CNI (e.g. hirsutism, alopecia, gingival hyperplasia, diabetes, polyoma nephropathy) conversion to another CNI can be a successful strategy to reduce side effects [243-245,278]. Due to differences in the efficacy and safety profile, the choice of CNI should include the individual risks and benefits for each patient. Despite their side effects, CNIs have been a cornerstone of modern immunosuppressive regimens for more than thirty years as they have resulted in an exemplary improvement in kidney graft survival [243,244]. Future protocols aim to minimise or even eliminate CNIs [245,248,250,279-282]. However, until such strategies provide superior outcomes, CNIs remain the standard of care [243,244,283]. For severe CNI-related side effects, CNI withdrawal, replacement, or profound reduction may be needed [243,245,248,279,280]. Special attention should be paid to maintenance patients, who may need less CNIs than previously thought [243,245,250,280,281,284]. Summary of evidenceLEMeta-analysis of tacrolimus and cyclosporine has demonstrated similar outcomes with respect to overall patient and graft survival however, tacrolimus provided better rejection prophylaxis and renal function.1aDue to differences in the efficacy and safety profile, the choice of CNI should take into account the immunological risk, characteristics, concomitant immunosuppression, and socio-economic factors of the recipient.1 RecommendationsStrength ratingUse calcineurin inhibitors for rejection prophylaxis as they represent current best practice pending publication of long-term results using newer agents.StrongUse tacrolimus as first-line calcineurin inhibitor due to its higher efficacy.StrongMonitor blood-levels of both cyclosporine and tacrolimus to allow appropriate dose adjustment of calcineurin inhibitors.Strong
