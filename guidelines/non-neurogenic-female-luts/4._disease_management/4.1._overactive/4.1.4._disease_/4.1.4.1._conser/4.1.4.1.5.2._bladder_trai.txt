4.1.4.1.5.2. Bladder training. Bladder training (BT) is a programme of patient education along with a scheduled voiding regimen with gradually increasing intervals. Specific goals are to correct faulty patterns of frequent urination, improve control over bladder urgency, prolong voiding intervals, increase bladder capacity, reduce incontinent episodes and restore patient confidence in controlling bladder function. The ideal form or intensity of a BT programme for OAB/UI is unclear. A comparison of anticholinergic treatment with BT in one Cochrane review with seven RCTs showed inconsistent results in terms of cure rates but reported significantly more patients improved with anticholinergics [143]. The same review showed that the addition of anticholinergics to BT as part of behavioural modification resulted in more subjective improvement but no difference in objective outcomes. Cognitive behavioural therapy involves the analysis of or change to a thought process related to the sensation of urgency or employment of a specified thought process during an episode of urgency. This includes mental distraction (the most common), relaxation and mindfulness practices. A SR on cognitive components of behavioural therapies for OAB concluded that they were neither well described nor rationalized. Behavioural therapy that includes cognitive component shows promise for OAB treatment, but its relative importance has not been well evaluated nor rigorously studied [144]. Another SR including 12 studies on the effect of cognitive behavioural therapy on women with UUI showed high level of evidence of its effectiveness on improving symptom severity and moderate level of evidence on QoL, psychological symptoms and patient satisfaction when compared with placebo. However, results were inconsistent with some studies showing no difference in objective parameters such as bladder capacity [145].
