9.1.2. Definition. To date short penis condition represents both a diagnostic and treatment challenge [1136,1137]. An accurate measurement of the penile shaft is a mandatory step in the assessment of patients complaining of a short penis and defining the norm [1138]. Indeed, a standard tool to address penile measurements and to counsel patients seeking penile augmentation procedures is needed. To date, the standard penile size has yet to be clearly defined. Even though several investigators have attempted to provide objective measurements to define a normal penile size, there is still no consensus on this (Table 21).

Despite the aforementioned limitations, SPL, defined as the distance between the pubic symphysis and the apex of the glans, represents the most overlapping measurement of the erect penis. Accordingly, a SPL of less than 2.5 standard deviations (SD) below the mean for the male’s age and race is considered as micropenis [1164,1165]. Summary of evidenceLEThere is a difference between true micropenis (anatomical-endocrinological)/short penis (complaint)/buried penis (complaint short penis + obesity) (panel consensus). Small penis anxiety/syndrome refers to a man’s excessive anxiety regarding his normal-sized penis.4A true micropenis is a congenital condition where the stretched penile length is 2.5 SD cm less than the average length in the population group and is the result of an underlying genetic or endocrine condition.3A buried penis is a normal-sized penis where there is a functional and visible loss of penile length due to an underlying pathological condition such as obesity or traumatic loss of length. The penis is covered by prepubic, scrotal or penile subcutaneous tissue or skin.3Penile Dysmorphic Disorder is a shorthand concept applied to Body Dysmorphic Disorder cases characterised by a strong focus on a perceived deficiency or flaw in a normal size or shape penis, resulting in mental health impairment and significant damage in important areas of the individual’s life.3
