7.3.10. Summary of evidence and guidelines for radical cystectomy and urinary diversion. Summary of evidenceLEHigher RC hospital volume is associated with lower post-operative mortality rates and higher quality of care.3Radical cystectomy includes removal of regional LNs.3There are data to support that extended vs. standard LND improves survival after RC.3No conclusive evidence exists as to the optimal extent of LND.2aEnsuring that patients are well informed about the various urinary diversion options prior to making a decision may help prevent or reduce decision regret, independent of the method of diversion selected.3The type of urinary diversion does not affect oncological outcome.3The use of extended VTE prophylaxis significantly decreases the incidence of VTE after RC.3In patients aged > 80 years with MIBC, cystectomy is an option.3Surgical complications of cystectomy and urinary diversion should be reported using a uniform grading system. Currently, the best-adapted grading system for cystectomy is the Clavien Dindo grading system.2b RecommendationsStrength ratingDo not delay radical cystectomy (RC) for > 3 months as it increases the risk of progression and cancer-specific mortality, unless the patient receives neoadjuvant chemotherapy.StrongPerform at least 10, and preferably > 20, RCs per hospital/per year.StrongBefore RC, fully inform the patient about the benefits and potential risks of all possible alternatives. The final decision should be based on a balanced discussion between the patient and the surgeon.StrongDo not offer an orthotopic bladder substitute diversion to patients who have an invasive tumour in the urethra or at the level of urethral dissection.StrongDo not offer pre-operative bowel preparation.StrongEmploy ‘Fast track’ measurements to reduce the time to bowel recovery.StrongOffer pharmacological VTE prophylaxis, such as low-molecular-weight heparin to RC patients, starting the first day post-surgery, for a period of at least 4 weeks.StrongOffer RC to patients with T2–T4a, N0M0 disease or very high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer.StrongPerform a lymph node dissection as an integral part of RC.Strong Figure 7.1: Flow chart for the management of T2–T4a N0M0 urothelial bladder cancer CT = computed tomography; MRI = magnetic resonance imaging; UUT = upper urinary tract.
