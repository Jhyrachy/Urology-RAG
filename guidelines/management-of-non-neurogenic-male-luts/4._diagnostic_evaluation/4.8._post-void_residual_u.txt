4.8. Post-void residual urine. Post-void residual (PVR) urine can be assessed by transabdominal ultrasound (US), bladder scan or catheterisation. Post-void residual is not necessarily associated with BOO, since high PVR volumes can be a consequence of obstruction and/or poor detrusor function/DU [78,79]. Using a PVR threshold of 50 mL, the diagnostic accuracy of PVR measurement has a PPV of 63% and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 52% for the prediction of BOO [80]. A large PVR is not a contraindication to watchful waiting (WW) or medical therapy, although it may indicate a poor response to treatment and especially to WW. In both the MTOPS and ALTESS studies, a high baseline PVR (PVR of ≥ 350 mL) was associated with an increased risk of symptom progression [65,66]. Monitoring of changes in PVR over time may allow for identification of patients at risk of AUR [81]. This is of importance for the treatment of patients using antimuscarinic medication. In contrast, baseline PVR has little prognostic value for the risk of BPO-related invasive therapy in patients on α1-blockers or WW [82]. However, due to large test-retest variability and lack of outcome studies, no PVR threshold for treatment decision has yet been established; this is a research priority. Since the role of PVR in males with LUTS has given inconclusive data, bladder voiding efficiency (BVE; [voided volume/total bladder capacity] × 100) has been introduced [83]. This parameter seems to be more reliable than PVR especially in patients with detrusor underactivity [84]. Together with BE, to overcome some limits of PVR, post-void residual urine ratio (PVR-R) was investigated. PVR-R represents the ratio of PVR to bladder volume (BV). This parameter indicates the non-functional bladder storage of urine after micturition and could be better related to the voiding emptying than the PVR per se. it is defined as PVR/total BV) × 100 [85].
