6.7.6. First-line treatment of metastatic CRPC. 6.7.6.1. Abiraterone Abiraterone was evaluated in 1,088 chemo-naive, asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic mCRPC patients in the phase III COU-AA-302 trial. Patients were randomised to abiraterone acetate or placebo, both combined with prednisone [1177]. Patients with visceral metastases were excluded. The main stratification factors were ECOG PS 0 or 1 and asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic disease. Overall survival and rPFS were the co-primary endpoints. After a median follow-up of 22.2 months there was significant improvement of rPFS (median 16.5 vs. 8.2 months, HR: 0.52, p < 0.001) and the trial was unblinded. At the final analysis with a median follow-up of 49.2 months, the OS endpoint was significantly positive (34.7 vs. 30.3 months, HR: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.70–0.93, p = 0.0033) [1178]. Adverse events related to mineralocorticoid excess and liver function abnormalities were more frequent with abiraterone, but mostly grade 1–2. Subset analysis of this trial showed the drug to be equally effective in an elderly population (> 75 years) [1179]. 6.7.6.2. Enzalutamide A randomised phase III trial (PREVAIL) included a similar patient population and compared enzalutamide and placebo [1180]. Men with visceral metastases were eligible but the numbers included were small. Corticosteroids were allowed but not mandatory. PREVAIL was conducted in a chemo-naive mCRPC population of 1,717 men and showed a significant improvement in both co-primary endpoints, rPFS (HR: 0.186, CI: 0.15–0.23, p < 0.0001), and OS (HR: 0.706, CI: 0.6–0.84, p < 0.001). A ≥ 50% decrease in PSA was seen in 78% of patients. The most common clinically relevant AEs were fatigue and hypertension. Enzalutamide was equally effective and well tolerated in men > 75 years [1181] as well as in those with or without visceral metastases [1182]. However, for men with liver metastases, there seemed to be no discernible benefit [1182,1183]. Enzalutamide has also been compared with bicalutamide 50 mg/day in a randomised double-blind phase II study (TERRAIN) showing a significant improvement in PFS (15.7 months vs. 5.8 months, HR: 0.44, p < 0.0001) in favour of enzalutamide [1183]. With extended follow-up and final analysis the benefit in OS and rPFS were confirmed [1184]. 6.7.6.3. Docetaxel A statistically significant improvement in median survival of 2.0–2.9 months has been shown with docetaxel based chemotherapy compared to mitoxantrone plus prednisone [1185,1186]. The standard first-line chemotherapy is docetaxel 75 mg/m2, three-weekly doses combined with prednisone 5 mg twice a day (BID), up to ten cycles. Prednisone can be omitted if there are contra-indications or no major symptoms. The following independent prognostic factors: visceral metastases, pain, anaemia (Hb < 13 g/dL), bone scan progression, and prior estramustine may help stratify the response to docetaxel. Patients can be categorised into three risk groups: low risk (0 or 1 factor), intermediate (2 factors) and high risk (3 or 4 factors), and show three significantly different median OS estimates of 25.7, 18.7 and 12.8 months, respectively [1187]. Age by itself is not a contra-indication to docetaxel [1188] but attention must be paid to careful monitoring and comorbidities as discussed in Section 5.4 - Estimating life expectancy and health status [1189]. In men with mCRPC who are thought to be unable to tolerate the standard dose and schedule, docetaxel 50 mg/m2 every two weeks seems to be well tolerated with less grade 3–4 AEs and a prolonged time to treatment failure [1190]. 6.7.6.4. Sipuleucel-T In 2010 a phase III trial of sipuleucel-T showed a survival benefit in 512 asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic mCRPC patients [1191]. After a median follow-up of 34 months, the median survival was 25.8 months in the sipuleucel-T group compared to 21.7 months in the placebo group, with a HR of 0.78 (p = 0.03). No PSA decline was observed and PFS was similar in both arms. The overall tolerance was very good, with more cytokine-related AEs grade 1–2 in the sipuleucel-T group, but the same grade 3–4 AEs in both arms. Sipuleucel-T is not available in Europe. 6.7.6.5. Ipatasertib The AKT inhibitor ipatasertib in combination with AAP was studied in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients with and without PTEN loss by IHC and previously untreated for mCRPC. The randomised phase III trial (IPAtential) showed a significant benefit for the first endpoint rPFS in the PTEN loss (IHC) 18.5 vs. 16.5 mo; p = 0.0335, HR: 0.77, 95% CI: 0.61–0,98) but not in the intention to treat (ITT) population. The OS results are still pending. Side effects of the AKT inhibitor ipatasertib include rash and diarrhoea [1077]. Grade 3 or higher AEs occurred nearly double as often in the combination group and the discontinuation rate due to AEs was four times higher. This combination is still investigational [1192]. 6.7.6.6. Combinations with PARP inhibitors Based on the suggestion that there is a synergistic antitumour effect when combining an ARPI with a PARP inhibitor, several such combination trials were conducted in first-line mCRPC patients with different trial designs, different patient selection and conflicting results. Abiraterone/prednisone plus olaparib A randomised double-blind, phase III trial (PROpel) of AAP plus olaparib (300 mg twice daily) or placebo in patients with mCRPC in the first-line setting was conducted [1193,1194]. Patients (n=796) were randomly assigned 1:1 to study treatment regardless of homologous recombination repair gene mutation (HRRm) status which was retrospectively evaluated and determined by tumour tissue and circulating tumour DNA tests. The primary end point was imaging-based PFS (ibPFS) by investigator assessment. The result was significantly positive in favour of the combination with ibPFS of 24.8 vs. 16.6 mo (HR 0.66; 95% CI: 0.54 to 0.81; p = 0.001). In the prespecified final analyses the key secondary endpoint OS had only 47.9% maturity and did not meet the prespecified 2-sided boundary for significance (HR 0.95% CI: 0.81, 0.67-1.0, p= 0,054).The subgroup of patients with positive HRRm status showed a rPFS HR of 0.50 (CI: 0.34 to 0.73). The BRCA mutated patients (11% of the ITT population) had an even larger benefit for rPFS (HR 0.24; 95% CI: 0.12, 0.45) and the OS HR in these patients was 0.30 (95% CI: 0.15, 0.59), suggesting that the improvement in rPFS observed in the ITT population was primarily driven by patients with a BRCA mutation [1195]. The most common AEs in patients receiving olaparib plus AAP were anaemia (48%; ≥G3 15%; at least one blood transfusion in 18%; multiple transfusions 12% [1195]. The most common adverse reactions with olaparib plus abiraterone were anaemia (48%), fatigue (38%), nausea (30%), diarrhoea (19%), decreased appetite (16%), lymphopenia (14%), dizziness (14%), and abdominal pain (13%); 18% of patients required at least one blood transfusion and 12% required multiple transfusions. The combination of olaparib plus AAP was approved by the EMA for the treatment of adult patients with mCRPC in whom chemotherapy is not clinically indicated [1240]. In the US, the FDA has approved olaparib with AAP for mCRPC patients with deleterious or suspected deleterious BRCA-mutations as determined by an FDA-approved companion diagnostic test [1197]. Abiraterone/prednisone plus niraparib In a randomised, double-blind, phase III trial (MAGNITUDE) AAP plus niraparib 200 mg once/daily or placebo, was evaluated [1198]. The study prospectively included 2 cohorts, an HRR-negative and an HRR-positive cohort. The HRR-negative cohort was closed early for futility after enrolling 200 patients. In the overall HRR-positive cohort, the addition of Niraparib to AAP resulted in a significant improvement in the first endpoint rPFS compared to AAP plus placebo (HR = 0.73; 95% CI 0.56-0.96; p = 0.0217) and the median rPFS was 16.5 vs. 13.7 months in favour of the combination. In particular, the 113 patients with BRCA 1/ 2 mutations [1199] who received AAP plus niraparib [1199] derived a major rPFS benefit (19.5 versus 10.9 months; HR = 0.55 [95% CI 0.39-0.78]; nominal p = 0.0007). The OS data is still immature. The most common side effects with Niraparib plus AAP in the ITT population were anemia (46.2%), fatigue (26.4%), hypertension (31.6%) and constipation (30.7%). The combination of niraparib plus AAP in a dual-action tablet has been approved by the EMA and the FDA for patients with mCRPC and BRCA 1/2 mutations in whom chemotherapy is not clinically indicated [1200]. Enzalutamide plus Talazoparib A randomised double-blind, phase III trial (TALAPRO-2) of the PARP inhibitor talazoparib (0.5mg daily) plus enzalutamide versus enzalutamide/placebo showed a significantly better median rPFS (first endpoint) in favour of the combintion regardless of homologous recombination repair pathway status [1202]. The median was not yet reached for the combination as compared to 21.9 mo in the control arm (95% CI 16.6-25.1). The HR for rPFS was 0.63 (0.51-0.78) with p<0.0001. For the subgroups of patients with HRR mutations the benefit of the combination was much more pronounced. The HRR gene-mutated population showed a median rPFS of 27.9 (16.6–not reached) for the talazoparib combination versus 16.4 (10.9–24.6) for the placebo group (0.46; 95% CI: 0.30–0.70; p=0.0003 ) and 0.70 (0.54–0.89; p=0.0039) in patients with a status of non-deficient or unknown. In an exploratory analysis, the HR for rPFS in patients with BRCA-mutated mCRPC was 0.23 (0.10–0.53; p=0.0002) and, in patients with non-BRCAm HRR gene-mutated mCRPC, it was 0.66 (0.39–1.12; p=0.12) in favour of the talazoparib combination.[1202] The OS data are still immature. The expected clinical benefit in the subgroups needs to be weighed against the potential burden of side effects. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events with the addition of talazoparib were anaemia, neutropenia, and fatigue; the most common grade 3–4 event was anaemia (46%), which improved after dose reduction, however, 39% required a blood transfusion, including 22% who required multiple transfusions, 8% discontinued treatment due to anemia and 2 patients on the combination were diagnosed with myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia [1202]. In TALAPRO-2 also an HRR-deficient-only cohort (cohort 2; N = 230) was recruited. The primary analysis for the combined HRR-deficient population (N = 399) met the rPFS endpoint with a HR 0.45 (95% CI, 0.33 to 0.61; P < 0.0001; median not reached at the time of the analysis for the talazoparib group versus 13.8 months for the placebo group). Also for this cohort data for OS are immature but favor talazoparib (HR 0.69; 95% confidence interval, 0.46 to 1.03; P = 0.07) [1203]. The FDA approved talazoparib with enzalutamide only for HRR gene-mutated mCRPC [1201]. The European commission approved talazoparib with enzalutamide for the treatment of patients with mCRPC (with or without gene mutations) in whom chemotherapy is not clinically indicated.
