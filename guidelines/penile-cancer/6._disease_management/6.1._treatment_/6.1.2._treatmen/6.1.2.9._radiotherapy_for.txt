6.1.2.9. Radiotherapy for T1 and T2 disease. Radiotherapy is an organ-preserving approach with good results in selected patients with T1–2 lesions [3]. It can be given as external radiotherapy with a minimum dose of 60 Gy EQD2 combined with a brachytherapy boost or as brachytherapy alone [160,161]. Brachytherapy has been studied only for lesions < 4 cm hence its use should be limited to tumours not exceeding this size. Reported results are best with brachytherapy with local control rates ranging from 70–90% [160,161]. The American Brachytherapy Society and the Groupe Européen de Curiethérapie-European Society of Therapeutic Radiation Oncology consensus statement for penile brachytherapy also reported good tumour control rates, acceptable morbidity, and functional organ preservation for penile brachytherapy for stages T1 and T2 disease [160]. Penile preservation rates of 70–88% have been reported [162], with overall penile conservation rates of 87% and 70% at 5 and 10 years. Pulsed-dose-rate brachytherapy can be used interchangeably with traditional low-dose rate and 15% local recurrences have been reported in one series [163]. High-dose rate brachytherapy has been introduced but experience is still limited [164-169]. The Panel’s SR identified 21 studies evaluating the efficacy of radiotherapy for the management of primary tumour in men with penile cancer. A total of 1,222 men had low-, pulse-, or high-dose rate brachytherapy after circumcision [3]. The cumulative mean 5-year RFRs were 78.6% (861/1,096) after brachytherapy and 55.2% (37/67) after EBRT. Four studies (including some EBRT and some brachytherapy cohorts) reported RFRs per disease stage, with 5-year RFRs for T1 ranging from 59–94%, 50–67% in T2, and 17–77% in T3 disease [167,170-172]. In the few studies comparing surgical treatment and radiotherapy, results of surgery were slightly better. In a meta-analysis comparing surgery and brachytherapy, 5-year OS and local control rates were 76–84% for surgery and 73–79% for brachytherapy, respectively [173]. The organ preservation rate for brachytherapy was 74% and there was no difference in survival. Local recurrence after radiotherapy can be salvaged by surgery [170]. Specific complications of radiotherapy for penile cancer are urethral stenosis (20–35%), glans necrosis (10–20%) and late fibrosis of the corpora cavernosa [174]. With brachytherapy, meatal stenosis has been reported to occur in up to 40% of cases but was much lower in a contemporary series of 73 patients with only 6.6%. In that series, 2.6% of patients reported pain with sexual intercourse and 5.3% dysuria over a follow-up of 5 years. Penile amputation for necrosis was necessary in 6.8% of patients [175]. Functional outcome after radiotherapy has not often been reported. In one report, 17/18 patients with normal erections before treatment maintained these after treatment [176]. After a minimum of 3 years (median 5.9) follow-up after brachytherapy treatment, 29/34 patients (median age 63 years) answered a self-reporting questionnaire. Urethral dilatation had been necessary in 30% of patients, self-catheterisation in 13%; erectile dysfunction was mild and 70% continued to maintain sexual activity, and QoL was good.
