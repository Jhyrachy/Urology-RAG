4.1.2. Evaluation. The evaluation of stable patients with suspected renal trauma is now based on a trauma protocol computed tomography (CT) scan, often performed prior to involvement of a urologist [39,40]. It is important to consider all parameters in the evaluation of the patient and to understand the indications for scanning when these are not absolute. Indicators of injury include a direct blow to the flank or rapid deceleration event (fall, high-speed road traffic accidents). Special consideration should be given to pre-existing renal disease [41] or the injured solitary kidney [42]. Pre-existing abnormality e.g. hydronephrosis makes injury more likely following trauma [43]. Vital signs should be recorded throughout the initial evaluation and give the most reliable indication of the urgency of the situation. Physical examination may reveal flank bruising, stab wounds, or bullet entry or exit wounds and abdominal tenderness. Urinalysis, haematocrit and baseline creatinine are required. Haematuria (visible or non-visible) is the key finding. However, major injury such as disruption of the UPJ, pedicle injuries, segmental arterial thrombosis and stab wounds may not have haematuria [44,45]. Haematuria that is out of proportion to the history of trauma may suggest pre-existing pathology [46]. Urine dipstick quickly evaluates for haematuria, but false-negative results can range from 3-10% [47]. An increased creatinine level usually reflects pre-existing renal pathology.
