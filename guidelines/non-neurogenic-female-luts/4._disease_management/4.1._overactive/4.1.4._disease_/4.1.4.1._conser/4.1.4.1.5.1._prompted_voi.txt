4.1.4.1.5.1. Prompted voiding and timed voiding. The term ‘prompted voiding’ implies that carers, rather than the patient, initiate the patient going to void with the aim of preventing or reducing UI. This applies largely to an assisted care setting. A SR (nine RCTs including mostly women with UI), comparing prompted voiding to standard care, suggested evidence of short-term benefit for management of UI [141]. Timed voiding is defined as fixed, predetermined, time intervals between voids and is applicable for those with or without cognitive impairment. A Cochrane review of timed voiding included four RCTs and found inconsistent improvement in continence compared with standard care in cognitively impaired adults [142].
