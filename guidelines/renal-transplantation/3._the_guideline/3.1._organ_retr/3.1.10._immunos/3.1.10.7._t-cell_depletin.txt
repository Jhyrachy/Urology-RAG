3.1.10.7. T-cell depleting induction therapy. Prophylactic immunosuppression regimens in many countries, particularly the U.S., use potent T-cell depleting ‘induction’ treatments [243,244,246,335,340,342-345]. Most frequently, ATG is used for prevention of rejection in immunological high-risk patients, as supported by meta-analysis [341], and recommended by guidelines [244,346]. In addition, these potent biological agents are used for the treatment of severe, steroid resistant rejection episodes [342,345]. Use of T-cell depleting antibodies in immunological low-risk patients has not been associated with improved long-term outcomes but with an increased risk of severe opportunistic infections and malignancy, particularly post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease [243,244,246,335,341-343]. Some centres use these agents to provide effective rejection prophylaxis in order to facilitate steroid withdrawal [304,340,344].
