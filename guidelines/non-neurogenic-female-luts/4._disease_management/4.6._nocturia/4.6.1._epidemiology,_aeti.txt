4.6.1. Epidemiology, aetiology, pathophysiology. The prevalence of nocturia varies according to age with 4–18% of women aged 20–40 years experiencing > 2episodes per night, compared to 28–62% of women aged > 70 years [583]. In a study of 1,000 community-dwelling older adults, female nocturia was associated with older age, African American race, history of UI, lower limb oedema and hypertension [584]. A report on > 5,000 adults aged 30–79 years identified around 28% with nocturia and found additional correlates with increased cardiac disease, type 2 diabetes, and diuretic use [585]. A SR and meta-analysis with moderate certainty evidence based on the GRADE approach, demonstrated that the higher incidence of nocturia among hypertensive patients was more strongly associated (1.2 to 1.3-fold) among Black and Asian women, unrelated to their age or BMI status [586]. Another SR with moderate certainty of evidence based on the GRADE approach showed that nocturia was associated with a 1.2-fold increased risk of falls and possibly an approximately 1.3-fold increased risk of fractures [587]. Another SR and meta-analysis concluded that nocturia is probably associated with an ~1.3-fold increased risk of death [587]. The aetiology of nocturia is multifactorial and can include both urological and non-urological causes. Urological conditions which may exhibit nocturia as a significant symptom include OAB syndrome, BOO, DU, and dysfunctional voiding. Non-urological causes include 24-hour polyuria (which includes nocturnal polyuria), congestive heart failure, sleep apnoea, restless leg syndrome, peripheral vascular disease, sleep disorders, night-time food ingestion, dependent oedema, and excessive fluid intake [588]. Given the varied aetiology of this symptom, there are a range of possible pathophysiological mechanisms, including: (1) 24-hour polyuria (e.g., diabetes mellitus, primary polydipsia, and diabetes insipidus); (2) nocturnal polyuria (e.g., behavioural, peripheral oedema, obstructive sleep apnoea, glycosuria, hormonal abnormalities and cardiac dysfunction ); (3) diminished bladder capacity (e.g., OAB syndrome/DO, PFM dysfunction, BOO, pharmaceuticals, LUT calculi or tumours, and neurological bladder dysfunction); and (4) primary or secondary sleep disorders [589]. In postmenopausal women the relative deficiency in endogenous oestrogen production is thought to exacerbate all major pathophysiological mechanisms that may underlie nocturia [590].
