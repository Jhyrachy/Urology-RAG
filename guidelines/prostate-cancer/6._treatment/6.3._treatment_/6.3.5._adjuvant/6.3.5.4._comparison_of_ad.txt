6.3.5.4. Comparison of adjuvant- and salvage radiotherapy. Two retrospective matched studies (510 and 149 patients receiving ART) failed to show an advantage for MFS [838,839]. However, both studies were underpowered for high-risk patients (pT3b/R1/ISUP grade group 4–5 PCa). In contrast to these studies, a propensity score-matched retrospective analysis of two cohorts of 366 pT3 and/or R1 patients found that compared to SRT at a PSA between 0.1 and 0.5 ng/mL, ART given at an undetectable PSA (< 0.1 ng/mL) improved all three endpoints; BCR, MFS, and OS [840]. Both approaches (ART and early SRT) together with the efficacy of adjuvant ADT are compared in three prospective RCTs: the Medical Research Council (MRC) Radiotherapy and Androgen Deprivation In Combination After Local Surgery (RADICALS) trial [841], the Trans-Tasman Oncology Group (TROG) Radiotherapy Adjuvant Versus Early Salvage (RAVES) trial [842], and the Groupe d’Etude des Tumeurs Uro- Genitales (GETUG-AFU 17) trial [843]. In addition, a pre-planned meta-analysis of all three trials has been published (Table 6.3.5.2) [844]. Two trials closed early after randomising 333/470 patients (RAVES) and 424/718 (GETUG-AFU-17) patients. RADICALS-RT included 1,396 patients with the option of subsequent inclusion in RADICALS-HT; 154/649 (24%) of patients starting in the adjuvant RT group also received neoadjuvant or adjuvant HT; 90 patients for six months/45 for 2 years/19 patients outside RADICALS-HT. From the SRT group, 61/228 (27%) received neoadjuvant or adjuvant HT for six months (n = 33) and two years (n = 13). Fifteen of these patients were treated outside the trial [841]. All men in the GETUG-AFU-17 trial (n = 424) received six months of HT. All together, 684 out of 2,153 patients received additional ADT for at least six months across both trials [844]. Radiotherapy to the pelvic lymphatics was allowed in the GETUG-AFU and in the RADICALS-RT trials. The primary endpoint for RAVES and GETUG-AFU 17 was biochemical PFS, and for RADICALS-RT MFS. So far only PFS data has been reported, and not MFS- or OS data. With a median follow-up between 4.9 years and 6.25 years there was no statistically significant difference for biochemical PFS for both treatments in all three trials (see Table 6.2.5.2) indicating that in the majority of patients adjuvant irradiation should be avoided. Additionally, there was a significant lower rate of grade ≥ 2 GU late side effects and grade 3–4 urethral strictures in favour of early SRT; which may also be caused by the low number of patients with PSA-progression and subsequent need for early SRT at the time of analysis (40% of patients). It is important to note that the indication for ART changed over the last ten years with the introduction of ultra-sensitive PSA-tests, favouring early SRT. Therefore many patients, randomised in these three trials (accruing 2006–2008) are not likely to benefit from ART as there is a low risk of biochemical progression (~20–30%) in, for example, pT3R0 or pT2R1-tumours. The median pre-SRT PSA in all 3 trials was 0.24 ng/mL. Therefore, patients with ‘low-risk factors’ of biochemical progression after RP should be closely followed up with ultra-sensitive assays and SRT should be discussed if needed as soon as PSA starts to rise, which has to be confirmed by a second PSA measurement (see Section 6.3). The proportion of patients with adverse pathology at RP (ISUP grade group 4–5 and pT3 with or without positive margins) in all three trials was low (between 10–20%) and therefore even the meta-analysis may be underpowered to show an outcome in favour of SRT [844]. In addition, the side-effect profile may have been impacted with a larger proportion of ART patients receiving treatment with older 3D-treatment planning techniques as compared to SRT patients (GETUG-AFU 17: ART, 69% 3D vs. 46% SRT) and patients treated more recently were more likely to undergo IMRT techniques with a proven lower rate of late side effects [634]. For these reasons, 10-year OS and MFS endpoints results should be awaited before drawing final conclusions. Due to the small number of patients with adverse pathology (ISUP grade group 4–5 and pT3) included in these three trials (between 10–20%), ART remains a recommended treatment option in highly selected patients with adverse pathology (‘high-risk patients’) i.e. ISUP grade group 4–5 and pT3 with or without positive margins [845,846]. This recommendation was supported by a published retrospective multi-centre study comparing ART and SRT in patients with high-risk features (pN1 or ISUP grade group 4–5 and pT3/4-tumours) after RP [847]. Aftera median follow-up of 8.2 years of the 26,118 men included in the study, 2,104 patients died, 25.62% from PCa (n = 539) and 2,424 patients had adverse pathology compared with 23.694 who did not. After excluding men with persistent PSA after RP, ART when compared with early SRT showed a significantly lower acute mortality risk(p = 0.02, HR: 0.33).
