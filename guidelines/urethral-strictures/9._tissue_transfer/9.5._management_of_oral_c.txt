9.5. Management of oral cavity after buccal mucosa harvesting. The post-operative morbidity of closure vs. non-closure of the buccal mucosa harvesting site has been evaluated by a number of prospective RCTs. The results are summarised in Table 9.4. Based on these findings, no clear recommendation can be provided as to whether or not to close the harvesting site and the decision can be left to the treating physician. Oral rinsing with chamomile [537] or chlorhexidine [523,538] solution has been suggested in the first post-operative days without any evidence that this reduces pain or other oral complications.
