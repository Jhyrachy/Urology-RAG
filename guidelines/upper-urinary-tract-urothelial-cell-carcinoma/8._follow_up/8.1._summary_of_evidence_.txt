8.1. Summary of evidence and recommendations for the follow-up of UTUC. Summary of evidenceLEFollow up should be based on risk stratification and the type of treatment.3 RecommendationsStrength ratingAfter radical nephroureterectomyLow-risk tumoursPerform cystoscopy at three months. If negative, perform subsequent cystoscopy 9 months later and then yearly, for 5 years.WeakHigh-risk tumoursPerform cystoscopy and urinary cytology at 3 months. If negative, repeat subsequent cystoscopy and cytology every 3 months for a period of 2 years, and every 6 months thereafter until 5 years, and then yearly.WeakPerform computed tomography (CT) urography and chest CT every 6 months for 2 years, and then yearly.WeakAfter kidney-sparing managementLow-risk tumoursPerform cystoscopy and CT urography at 3 and 6 months, and then yearly for 5 years.WeakPerform ureteroscopy (URS) at 3 months if no second-look ureteroscopy was performed.WeakHigh-risk tumoursPerform second-look URS and cytology in 6 weeks. If no residual tumour follow similar follow-up principles as for high-risk disease treated with radical nephroureterectomy.Weak
