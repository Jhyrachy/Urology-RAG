6.5. Molecular factors. Numerous molecular markers such as carbonic anhydrase IX (CaIX), VEGF, HIF, Ki67 (proliferation), p53, p21 [227], PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog) cell cycle [228], E-cadherin, osteopontin [229] CD44 (cell adhesion) [230,231], CXCR4 [232], PD-L1 [233], miRNA, SNPs, gene mutations, and gene methylations have been investigated (LE: 3) [234]. While the majority of these markers are associated with prognosis and many improve the discrimination of current prognostic models, there has been very little emphasis on external validation studies. Furthermore, there is no conclusive evidence on the value of molecular markers for treatment selection in mRCC [213,233,235]. Their routine use in clinical practice is therefore not recommended. Several prognostic and predictive marker signatures have been described for specific systemic treatments in mRCC. In the JAVELIN Renal 101 trial (NCT02684006), a 26-gene immunomodulatory gene signature predicted PFS in those treated with avelumab plus axitinib, while an angiogenesis gene signature was associated with PFS for sunitinib. Mutational profiles and histocompatibility leukocyte antigen (HLA) types were also associated with PFS, while programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression and tumour mutational burden were not [236]. In IMmotion151 (NCT02420821), a T effector/IFN-Î³-high or angiogenesis-low gene expression signature predicted improved PFS for atezolizumab plus bevacizumab compared to sunitinib. The angiogenesis-high gene expression signature correlated with longer PFS in patients treated with sunitinib [237]. In CheckMate 214 (NCT02231749), a higher angiogenesis gene signature score was associated with better overall response rates and PFS for sunitinib, while a lower angiogenesis score was associated with higher ORR in those treated with nivolumab plus ipilimumab. Progression-free survival > 18 months was more often seen in patients with higher expression of Hallmark inflammatory response and Hallmark epithelial mesenchymal transition gene sets [219]. Urinary and plasma Kidney-Injury Molecule-1 (KIM-1) has been identified as a potential diagnostic and prognostic marker. KIM-1 concentrations were found to predict RCC up to five years prior to diagnosis and were associated with a shorter survival time [238]. KIM-1 is a glycoprotein marker of acute proximal tubular injury and therefore mainly expressed in RCC derived from the proximal tubules such as ccRCC and pRCC [239]. While early studies are promising, more high-quality research is required. Several retrospective studies and large molecular screening programmes have identified mutated genes and chromosomal changes in ccRCC with distinct clinical outcomes. The expression of the BAP1 and PBRM1 genes, situated on chromosome 3p in a region that is deleted in more than 90% of ccRCCs, have shown to be independent prognostic factors for tumour recurrence [240-242]. These published reports suggest that patients with BAP1- mutant tumours have worse outcomes compared with patients with PBRM1-mutant tumours [241]. Loss of chromosome 9p and 14q have been consistently shown to be associated with poorer survival [243-245]. The TRACERx renal consortium has proposed a genetic classification based on RCC evolution (punctuated vs. branched vs. linear), which correlates with tumour aggressiveness and survival [244]. Additionally, a 16-gene signature was shown to predict disease-free survival (DFS) in patients with non-metastatic RCC [246]. However, these signatures have not been validated by independent researchers yet.
