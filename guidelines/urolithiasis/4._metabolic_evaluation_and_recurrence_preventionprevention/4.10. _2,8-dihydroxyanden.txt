4.10.  2,8-Dihydroxyandenine stones and xanthine stones. All 2,8-Dihydroxyadenine and xanthine stone formers are at high risk of recurrence. Both stone types are rare. Diagnosis and specific prevention are similar to those for uric acid stones [23]. 4.10.1.  2,8-Dihydroxyadenine stones A genetically determined defect of adenine phosphoribosyl transferase causes high urinary excretion of poorly soluble 2,8-Dihydroxyadenine [694]. High-dose allopurinol or febuxostat are important options but should be given with regular monitoring [695]. 4.10.2. Xanthine stones Patients who form xanthine stones usually show decreased levels of serum uric acid. There is no available pharmacological intervention. 4.10.3. Fluid intake and diet Recommendations for general preventive measures apply. Pharmacological intervention is difficult; therefore, high fluid intake ensures optimal specific weight levels of urine < 1.010 (urine specific gravity). A purine-reduced diet decreases the risk of spontaneous crystallisation in urine.
