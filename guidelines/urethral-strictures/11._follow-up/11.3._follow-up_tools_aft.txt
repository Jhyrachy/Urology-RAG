11.3. Follow-up tools after urethral surgery. 11.3.1. Diagnostic tools for follow-up after urethral surgery 11.3.1.1. Calibration during follow-up after urethral surgery The difference between calibration and urethral dilatation is usually subjective as soft strictures may be dilated during calibration [567]; therefore, urethral calibration should be used with caution for follow-up after urethroplasty. Dedicated calibration bougies should be used and not dilatators. 11.3.1.2. Urethrocystoscopy during follow-up after urethral surgery Urethrocystoscopy has been considered the most useful tool to confirm the presence or absence of a recurrent stricture [143,568], as up to 35% of patients with re-strictures remain asymptomatic [145]. Also, the cystoscope could be a measure to calibrate the strictured lumen, bearing in mind the most commonly used endoscopes: 15.7 Fr (5 mm diameter) or 17.3 Fr (5.5 mm diameter) [568]. Urethrocystoscopy allows differentiation of recurrences as diaphragm/cross-bridging – responding to simple intervention, or significant urethral restrictures – requiring repeated interventions or ReDo surgeries [569]. Endoscopic assessment at three months after anterior urethroplasty can predict the risk for further re-intervention at one year. Compared to normal endoscopy, large calibre (> 17 Fr) restrictures have a HR of 3.1 (1.35-7.29) for repeat intervention while small calibre (< 17 Fr) restrictures have a 23.7 HR (12.44-45.15) adjusted for age, stricture length, location, and aetiology [143]. The main problem with using urethrocystoscopy for routine follow-up is the low compliance of patients as only 54% of patients underwent endoscopy at one year after urethroplasty, even when it was a part of a study protocol [145]. 11.3.1.3. Retrograde urethrogram and voiding cystourethrogram during follow-up after urethral surgery Retrograde urethrogram combined with VCUG are commonly used to confirm suspected recurrence [570,571] or as part of a routine protocol to assess post-operative urethral patency [572,573]. 11.3.1.4. Urethral ultrasound – Sonourethrography during follow-up after urethral surgery The use of SUG as a follow-up tool is not very common. It would be a reliable tool for diagnostic recurrent strictures [570]. 11.3.2. Screening tools for follow-up after urethral surgery These tools are used to assess whether there is suspicion of stricture recurrence and need for subsequent diagnostic evaluation (see section 5. Diagnostic evaluation). 11.3.2.1. Flow-rate analysis during follow-up after urethral surgery Evaluating the Qmax is the commonest follow-up tool. Different cut-off points from Qmax 15 ml/s or 12 ml/s were suggested to consider the intervention as a failure or to trigger a confirmatory test for recurrence [574]. There is no clear threshold, and 19% of patients with Qmax < 14 ml/s would still have a patent urethra, allowing passage of 15 Fr cystoscope [146]. Flow rates may be affected by operator error, BPO/LUTS, bladder dysfunction, and variations in bladder capacity. Further limitations of uroflowmetry include the need for a minimum voided volume of 125-150 ml to reach a voided flow rate that reliably predicts an abnormality [567]. Even in controlled settings, the percentage of patients with adequate pre- and post-operative uroflowmetry analysis is only 31% [573]. Comparing both pre- and post-operative Qmax levels was suggested, and a difference in Qmax of 10 ml/s or less is found to be a reliable screen tool for recurrence (sensitivity 92%, specificity 78%). This measure also has strong reproducibility (R=0.52) [573]. Unfortunately, this improvement after urethroplasty is significantly different between age groups, with less than 10 ml/s average change in those over 65 years old, probably affected by BPO and/or bladder dysfunction [575]. Another parameter to consider is the shape of the voiding curve, recording it as flat (obstructed) or bell-shaped [576]. An obstructive voiding curve demonstrated 93% sensitivity to predict recurrent strictures, while a combination of urinary symptoms and obstructive voiding curve achieved 99% sensitivity and 99% NPV [576]. 11.3.2.2. Post-void residual ultrasound measure during follow-up after urethral surgery Post-void residual US measure is significantly increased in patients with recurrent strictures compared with those without recurrences [570]. Unfortunately, PVR measurement is affected by abdominal ascites, bladder diverticula and/or poor bladder function [567], with some studies reporting inconsistent correlation with obstruction in the presence of BPO. Also, US measures of PVR are user dependent, showing high interobserver variability. Combined with other tests – uroflowmetry, IPSS, and SUG – PVR achieves adequate predictive values [570], but currently there is no literature to support its solo use, to assess urethral stricture recurrence [577]. 11.3.2.3. Symptom questionnaires during follow-up after urethral surgery The IPSS questionnaire, despite being designed for BPO, showed significant improvement after successful urethroplasty and inverse significant correlation with Qmax [565,567]. The mean improvement of IPSS isaround -11 points (range -19 to -5) [575].

Combination of IPSS and Qmax analysis was suggested to diagnose recurrences. Using an IPSS cut-off point of 10 points associated with Qmax > 15 ml/s would prevent further invasive studies in 34% of patients, while only 4.3% of strictures < 14 Fr would have been missed. Using an IPSS cut-off point of 15 points associated with Qmax > 15 ml/s would prevent further invasive studies in 37% of cases, while 6% of strictures < 14 Fr would have been missed [579]. The Visual Prostate Symptom Score (VPSS) was also used to diagnose recurrent urethral strictures, offering a significantly shorter time to completion compared with IPSS, especially in cases of illiteracy or limited education. Visual Prostate Symptom Score showed a good correlation with IPSS, Qmax and urethral diameter. A combination of VPSS > 8 with Qmax < 15 ml/s had a NPV of 89% and a PPV of 87% for recurrent urethral strictures [580]. Post-micturition dribble, assessed by the specific question of the USS-PROM questionnaire, was present in 73% of patients pre-operatively and 40% after anterior urethroplasty, while only 6.3% was de novo. Incidence was not predicted by stricture location nor urethroplasty type [150]. 11.3.3. Quality of life assessment, including disease specific questionnaires during follow-up after urethral surgery Urethral stricture affects QoL evaluated by EQ-5D-3L questionnaire. Pre-operative anxiety and depression was found in 29% of patients. De novo AD after urethroplasty is uncommon (10%) and has two predictors: decreased sexual function and poor reported image of overall health [581]. A more recommended approach is the assessment of the condition-related QoL [582]. The USS-PROM proved useful to assess outcomes in anterior urethroplasty patients [562]. Its use also received criticism, as some of the individual generic QoL questions do not improve after successful urethroplasty, as they are not condition-specific [583]. Currently, there is another version of PROM, being developed and validated by a North American collaborative group, including questions related to the sexual consequences of urethral stricture disease [161]. PROM questionnaires should be implemented in each visit to check for functional success, as they are able to show improvement over time. The Core Lower Urinary Tract Symptom Score (CLSS) questionnaire was used to assess pre- and post-urethroplasty pain in the bladder, penis/urethra, and perineum/scrotum. Most of the parameters improved after urethroplasty, but up to 29% of patients reported worsening of perineal pain after surgery [584]. Sexual function should be evaluated by validated tools if not assessed in a PROM. The international index on erectile function (IIEF), SHIM, O´Leary Brief Male Sexual Function Inventory (BMFSI), SLQQ (Sexual Life Quality Questionnaire), Male Sexual Health Questionnaire (MSHQ) have all been used after urethroplasties for evaluation of erectile and ejaculatory functions. Other non-validated tools were suggested such as the Post- Urethroplasty Sexual Questionnaire (PUSQ) [585] or specific questionnaires for genital appearance (length, curvature) or sensitivity [586]. Summary of evidenceLERetrograde urethrography and urethrocystoscopy are able to identify anatomical success after a urethroplasty.2aA significant gap was demonstrated between objective and subjective outcomes after urethroplasties. PROM questionnaires are specific tools to assess subjective outcomes and patient satisfaction after urethroplasty surgeries.2aValidated questionnaires proved useful to assess the consequences of urethral surgery on sexual function.2a RecommendationsStrength ratingUse cystoscopy or retrograde urethrography to assess anatomic success after urethroplasty surgery.WeakUse PROM questionnaires to assess subjective outcomes and patient satisfaction.StrongUse validated questionnaires to evaluate sexual function after urethral stricture surgeries.Strong
