3.3.3. Diagnostic evaluation. Asymptomatic bacteriuria is defined by a mid-stream sample of urine showing bacterial growth â‰¥ 105 cfu/mL in two consecutive samples in women [26] and in one single sample in men [27] in an individual without urinary tract symptoms. Cystoscopy and/or imaging of the upper urinary tract is not mandatory if the medical history is otherwise without remark. If persistent growth of urease producing bacteria, i.e. Proteus mirabilis is detected, stone formation in the urinary tract must be excluded [28,29,235]. In men, a digital rectal examination (DRE) has to be performed to investigate the possibility of prostate diseases (see section 3.11).
