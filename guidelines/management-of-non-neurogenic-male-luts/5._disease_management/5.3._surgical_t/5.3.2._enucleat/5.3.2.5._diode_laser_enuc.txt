5.3.2.5. Diode laser enucleation of the prostate. Mechanism of action: For prostate surgery, diode lasers with a wavelength of 940, 980, 1,318, and 1,470 nm (depending on the semiconductor used) are marketed for vaporisation and enucleation. Only a few have been evaluated in clinical trials [439]. Efficacy: One RCT comparing 1,318 nm diode laser enucleation of the prostate (DiLEP) with B-TURP in patients with mean prostate volume < 80 mL reported no significant differences in IPSS, QoL score, Qmax and PVR at six months follow-up [440]. Another RCT comparing 1,470 nm DiLEP with B-TURP in patients with mean prostate volume < 80 mL also reported no significant differences in IPSS, QoL score, Qmax and PVR at twelve months follow-up [441]. In addition, three RCTs comparing 980 nm DiLEP with PKEP in patients with mean prostate volume < 80 mL [442,443] and > 80 mL [444] reported no significant differences in IPSS, QoL score, Qmax and PVR at twelve months follow-up. An RCT of DilEP (980 nm) vs. HoLEP detected no significant difference in Qmax, PVR, IPSS, and QoL within twelve months follow‚Äêup [445]. Tolerability and safety: One small RCT comparing 1,318 nm DiLEP with B-TURP in patients with mean prostate volume < 80 mL and six months follow-up reported a significantly longer operation time for DiLEP, but shorter catheterisation and hospitalisation times, as well as less blood loss (without differences in blood transfusion rates) [440]. No differences in complication rates were reported between the two arms [440]. Another RCT comparing 1,470 nm DiLEP with B-TURP in patients with prostate volume < 80 mL and twelve months follow-up reported significantly shorter operation, catheterisation, and hospitalisation times with less blood loss (without differences in blood transfusion rates) for DiLEP, with no differences in complication rates between the two arms [441]. Three RCTs comparing 980 nm DiLEP with PKEP in patients with prostate volume < 80 mL [442,443] and > 80 mL [444] and twelve months follow-up reported conflicting peri-operative outcomes. All trials reported no differences in blood transfusion rates and complication rates [442-444]. An RCT of DiLEP (980 nm) vs. HoLEP with twelve months follow-up demonstrated no significant difference in peri-operative outcomes including operation and hospitalisation times [445]. Practical considerations: Diode laser enucleation seems to offer similar efficacy and safety when compared to either B-TURP or bipolar transurethral (plasmakinetic) enucleation. Based on the limited number of mainly low-quality RCTs, and controversial data on the retreatment rate, results for DiLEP should be evaluated in further higher quality RCTs. Summary of evidenceLELaser enucleation of the prostate using the 1,318 nm or 1,470 laser showed comparable short-term efficacy and safety to B-TURP. Peri-operative parameters like blood loss, catheterisation time and hospital stay are in favour of diode enucleation.1bLaser enucleation of the prostate using the 980 nm laser showed comparable short-term efficacy and safety to bipolar transurethral (plasmakinetic) enucleation.1b RecommendationStrength ratingOffer 120-W 980 nm, 1,318 nm or 1,470 nm diode laser enucleation of the prostate to men with moderate-to-severe LUTS as a comparable alternative to bipolar transurethral (plasmakinetic) enucleation or bipolar transurethral resection of the prostate.Weak
