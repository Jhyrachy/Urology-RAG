7.1. Treatment of primary urethral carcinoma in males. Previously, treatment of male distal urethral carcinoma followed the procedure for penile cancer, with surgical excision of the primary lesion with a wide safety margin [36]. Distal urethral tumours exhibit significantly improved survival rates compared with proximal tumours [67]. Therefore, in the treatment of distal urethral carcinoma the focus of clinicians has shifted towards improving functional outcomes and quality of life (QoL), while preserving oncological safety. A retrospective series found no evidence of local recurrence, even with < 5 mm resection margins (median follow-up: 17–37 months), in men with pT1–3N0–2 distal urethral carcinoma treated with well-defined penile-preserving surgery and additional iliac/inguinal lymphadenectomy (LND) for clinically suspected LN disease [68]. Similar results for the feasibility of penile-preserving surgery have also been reported in recent series [69,70]. However, a series on patients treated with penile-preserving surgery for distal urethral carcinoma reported a higher risk of progression in patients with positive proximal margins, which was also more frequently observed in cases with lymphovascular and peri-neural invasion of the primary tumour [71]. 7.1.1. Summary of evidence and guidelines for the treatment of primary urethral carcinoma in males Summary of evidenceLEIn distal urethral tumours performing a partial urethrectomy with a minimal safety margin does not increase the risk of local recurrence.3 RecommendationsStrength ratingOffer distal urethrectomy as an alternative to penile amputation in localised distal urethral tumours, if negative surgical margins can be achieved intra-operatively.WeakEnsure complete circumferential assessment of the proximal urethral margin if penile preserving surgery is intended.Strong
