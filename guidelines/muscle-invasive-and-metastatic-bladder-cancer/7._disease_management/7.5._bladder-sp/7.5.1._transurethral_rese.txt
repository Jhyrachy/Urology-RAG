7.5.1. Transurethral resection of bladder tumour. Transurethral resection of bladder tumour alone in MIBC patients is only possible as a therapeutic option if tumour growth is limited to the superficial muscle layer and if re-staging biopsies are negative for residual (invasive) tumour [417]. In general, approximately 50% of patients will still have to undergo RC for recurrent MIBC with a disease-specific mortality rate of up to 47% in this group [418]. A disease-free status at re-staging TURB appears to be crucial in making the decision not to perform RC [419,420]. A prospective study by Solsona et al., including 133 patients after radical TURB and re-staging negative biopsies, reported a 15-year follow-up [420]. Thirty per cent of patients had recurrent NMIBC and went on to intravesical therapy, and 30% (n = 40) progressed, of which 27 died of BC. After five, ten, and fifteen years, the results showed CSS rates of 81.9%, 79.5%, and 76.7%, respectively and PFS rates with an intact bladder of 75.5%, 64.9%, and 57.8%, respectively. In conclusion, TURB alone should only be considered as a therapeutic option for muscle-invasive disease after radical TURB, when the patient is unfit for cystectomy, or refuses open surgery, or as part of a TMT bladder-preserving approach. 7.5.1.1. Guideline for transurethral resection of bladder tumour RecommendationStrength ratingDo not offer transurethral resection of bladder tumour alone as a curative treatment option as most patients will not benefit.Strong
