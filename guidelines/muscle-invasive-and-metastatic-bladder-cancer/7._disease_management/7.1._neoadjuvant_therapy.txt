7.1. Neoadjuvant therapy. 7.1.1. Introduction The standard treatment for patients with urothelial MIBC and MIBC with subtypes is RC. However, RC only provides 5-year survival in about 50% of patients [248-250]. To improve survival in patients with cN0M0 disease, cisplatin-based NAC has been used since the 1980s [248-252]. 7.1.2. Role of cisplatin-based chemotherapy There are theoretical advantages and disadvantages of administering chemotherapy before planned definitive surgery to patients with resectable muscle-invasive cN0M0 UC of the bladder: Chemotherapy is delivered at the earliest time-point, when the burden of micrometastatic disease is expected to be low.Potential reflection of in vivo chemosensitivity.Tolerability of chemotherapy and patient compliance are expected to be better pre-cystectomy.Patients may respond to NAC and have a favourable pathological response as determined mainly by achieving ypT0, ≤ ypT1, ypN0 and negative surgical margins. An analysis to identify the optimal definition of pathological response reported a significantly higher risk of recurrence in patients with ypTaN0 or ypT1N0 disease (with or without Tis) at RC and thus proposed that optimal pathological response after NAC be defined as attainment of ypT0N0/ypTisN0 at RC [253].Delayed cystectomy might compromise the outcome in patients not sensitive to chemotherapy [254-256]. A comparative survival analysis of patients treated with NAC and RC vs. RC alone based on data from the U.S. National Cancer Database showed that organ-confined disease (≤ pT2) after NAC was associated with decreased risk of death (HR: 0.85, 95% CI: 0.79–0.91) compared to RC alone, whereas > pT2 was associated with increased risk of death (HR: 1.46, 95% CI: 1.34–1.60) [257]. However, there are no prospective trials indicating that delayed surgery due to NAC has a negative impact on survival. In the phase III VESPER trial, comparing gemcitabine/cisplatin (GC) vs. high-dose-intensity methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicine and cisplatin (HD-MVAC) in the peri-operative setting, approximately 90% of patients proceeded to surgery (with median delay of 48 days for GC and 51 days for dd-MVAC) [258].Neoadjuvant chemotherapy does not seem to affect the outcome of surgical morbidity. In a recently reported large multicenter retrospective analysis, NAC did not lead to an increased risk of post-operative complications after RC [259]. In the combined Nordic trials (n = 620), NAC did not have a major adverse effect on the percentage of performable cystectomies. The cystectomy frequency was 86% in the experimental arm and 87% in the control arm with 71% of patients receiving all three chemotherapy cycles [260].Clinical staging using bimanual palpation, CT or MRI may result in over- and understaging and have a staging accuracy of only 70% [87]. Overtreatment is a possible negative consequence.Gender may have an impact on chemotherapeutic response and oncologic outcomes [261,262]. Female patients tend to have a better cancer-related response to NAC as compared to male patients.Neoadjuvant chemotherapy should only be used in patients eligible for cisplatin-combination chemotherapy; other combinations (or monotherapies) are inferior in metastatic BC and have not been fully tested in a neoadjuvant setting [263-270]. 7.1.2.1. Summary of available data Several phase III RCTs addressed the potential survival benefit of NAC administration [263-267,271-274]. The main differences in trial designs were the type of chemotherapy (i.e., single-agent cisplatin or combination chemotherapy) and the number of cycles provided. Patients had to be fit for cisplatin. Since these studies differed considerably for patient numbers, patient characteristics (e.g., clinical T-stages included) and the type of definitive treatment offered (cystectomy and/or RT), pooling of results was not possible. Three meta-analyses were undertaken to establish if NAC prolongs survival [268-270]. In a meta-analysis including updated patient data from 11 randomised trials (n = 3,005), a significant survival benefit was shown in favour of NAC [270]. The most recent meta-analysis included four additional RCTs, and used the updated results from the Nordic I, Nordic II, and BA06 30894 trials including data from 427 new patients and updated information from 1,596 patients. The results of this analysis confirmed the previously published data and showed an 8% absolute improvement in survival at five years with a number needed-to-treat of 12.5 [275]. Only cisplatin-combination chemotherapy with at least one additional chemotherapeutic agent resulted in a meaningful therapeutic benefit [268,270]; the regimens tested were methotrexate, vinblastine, adriamycin (epirubicin) plus cisplatin (MVA(E)C), cisplatin, methotrexate plus vinblastine (CMV), cisplatin plus methotrexate (CM), cisplatin plus adriamycin and cisplatin plus 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) [276]. The updated analysis of a large phase III RCT [264] with a median follow-up of eight years confirmed previous results and provided additional findings: 16% reduction in mortality risk;improvement in 10-year survival from 30% to 36% with neoadjuvant CMV;benefit with regard to distant metastases;the addition of neoadjuvant CMV provided no benefit for locoregional control and locoregional DFS, independent of the definitive treatment. More modern chemotherapeutic regimens such as GC have shown similar pT0/pT1 rates as methotrexate, vinblastine, adriamycin plus cisplatin in retrospective series and pooled data analyses [276-279]. Modified dd-MVAC was tested in two small single-arm phase II studies demonstrating high rates of pathologic complete remission [280,281]. Moreover, a large cross-sectional analysis showed higher rates of down-staging and pathological complete response for dd-MVAC [282]. In the GETUG/AFU V05 VESPER RCT of peri-operative chemotherapy, 500 patients were randomised to either 6 cycles of dd-MVAC once every 2 weeks vs. 4 cycles of GC once every 3 weeks prior to surgery (neoadjuvant group) or after surgery (adjuvant group) with a primary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS) at 3 years. In 493 patients (437 neoadjuvant and 56 adjuvant), a similar pathologic response rate (ypT0N0) in patients treated with dd-MVAC 42% and GC 36% (p = 0.2) was seen. The < ypT2N0 rate was 63% and 50% in the dd-MVAC and GC patients, respectively. Organ-confined response (< ypT3N0) was observed more frequently in the dd-MVAC arm (77% vs. 63%, p = 0.001). For all patients in the trial, 3-year PFS was improved in the dd-MVAC arm, but the study did not meet its primary endpoint (3-year rate: 64% vs. 56%, HR: 0.77 [95% CI: 0.57–1.02], p = 0.066); nevertheless, the dd-MVAC arm was associated with a significantly longer time to progression (3-year rate: 69% vs. 58%, HR: 0.68 [95% CI: 0.50–0.93], p = 0.014). In the neoadjuvant group, PFS at 3 years was significantly higher in the dd-MVAC arm (66% vs. 56%, HR: 0.70 [95% CI: 0.51–0.96], p = 0.025). Dose- dense MVAC was associated with more severe asthenia and GI side effects than GC [258,283]. In a single-center retrospective analysis in patients with MIBC, neoadjuvant accelerated MVAC was safe and efficacious irrespective of age, provided that patients were fit and deemed suitable candidates for cisplatin [284]. Another dose- dense regimen using GC was reported in two small phase II trials [285,286]. While pathological response rates (< pT2) in the range of 45%–57% were achieved, one trial had to be closed prematurely due to high rates of severe vascular events [285]. This approach is therefore not recommended outside of clinical trials. As an alternative to the standard dose of cisplatin-based NAC with 70 mg/m2 on day 1, split-dose modifications regimens are often used with 35 mg/m2 on days 1+8 or days 1+2. In a retrospective analysis the standard schedule was compared to a split-dose schedule in terms of complete and partial pathological response. A lower number of complete and partial response rates was seen in the split-dose group, but these results were not statistically significant [287]. Efforts aimed at improving the efficacy of NAC in MIBC are ongoing. In the double- blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase II NEOBLADE trial of neoadjuvant gemcitabine and cisplatin chemotherapy with nintedanib, a small molecule inhibitor that targets tyrosine kinases PDGFR, FGFR-1, and VEGFR-2, or placebo, in locally-advanced MIBC, the addition of nintedanib to chemotherapy was safe but did not improve the rate of pathological complete response [288]. There seem to be differences in the outcomes of patients treated with NAC for primary or secondary MIBC with retrospective data suggesting that patients with primary MIBC have better pathologic response rates to NAC in comparison to patients with secondary MIBC [289]. However, in the absence of prospective data, patients with secondary MIBC should be treated similarly to those presenting with primary MIBC [225]. It is unclear, if patients with non-UC histology will also benefit from NAC. A retrospective analysis demonstrated that patients with neuroendocrine tumours had improved OS and lower rates of non-organ-confined disease when receiving neoadjuvant cisplatinum/etoposide chemotherapy. In case of micropapillary differentiation, sarcomatoid differentiation and adenocarcinoma, lower rates of non-organ confined disease were found, but no statistically significant impact on OS. Patients with SCC did not benefit from NAC [290]. A 2019 systematic review showed benefit of NAC for patients with micropapillary-, plasmacytoid-, sarcomatoid-, and mixed variants but especially for patients with neuroendocrine tumours [66]. A U.S. National Cancer Database study evaluating potential associations between receipt of NAC, pathological downstaging and OS for patients with histological subtype MIBC demonstrated that NAC was associated with pathological downstaging for all MIBC histological subtypes (UC; sarcomatoid UC; micropapillary UC; SCC; neuroendocrine carcinoma; and adenocarcinoma), with improved OS for patients with UC, sarcomatoid variant UC and neuroendocrine carcinoma [291]. 7.1.3. The role of imaging and predictive biomarkers (see also section 5.2) Data from small imaging studies aiming to identify responders in patients treated with NAC suggest that response after two cycles of treatment is predictive of outcome. Although mpMRI has the advantage of better resolution of the bladder wall tissue planes as compared to CT, it is not ready yet for standard patient care. However, bladder mpMRI may be useful to inform on tumour stage after TURB and response to NAC [119]. So far PET/CT, MRI or DCE-MRI cannot accurately assess treatment response [292-295]. To identify progression during NAC, imaging is being used in many centres notwithstanding the lack of supporting evidence. For responders to NAC, especially in those with a complete response (pT0 N0), treatment has a major positive impact on OS [296,297]. Therefore, reliable predictive markers to identify patients most likely to benefit from chemotherapy are needed. A study investigated how molecular subtypes impact pathological response and survival in patients receiving pre-operative cisplatin-based chemotherapy [298]. Patients with genomically unstable (GU) and urothelial-like (Uro) tumours had higher proportions of complete pathological response (16/31 [52%] and 17/54 [31%] vs. 5/24 (21%) for the basal/squamous (Ba/ Sq) subtype) following NAC and RC. Molecular subtype was independently associated with improved survival for patients with GU tumours (HR: 0.29, 95% CI: 0.11–0.79) and UroC tumours (HR: 0.37, 95% CI: 0.14–0.94) compared with Ba/Sq tumours, adjusting for clinical stage. Molecular tumour profiling might guide the use of NAC in the future but, as yet, this is not applicable in routine practice [299-301] (see Chapter 6 - Markers). 7.1.4. Role of neoadjuvant immunotherapy and chemo-immunotherapy Inhibition of PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint has demonstrated significant benefit in patients with unresectable and metastatic BC in the second-line setting and in platinum-ineligible PD-L1+ patients as first-line treatment using different agents. Checkpoint inhibitors are increasingly tested also in the neoadjuvant setting; either as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy or CTLA-4 checkpoint inhibition. Data from two phase II trials have been presented with encouraging results [241,242]. The results of PURE-01, a phase II trial using the PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab reported a complete pathological remission (pT0) in 42% and pathological response (< pT2) in 54% of patients, whereas in the single-arm phase II trial with atezolizumab a pathologic complete response rate of 31% was reported. In an update to the ABACUS trial using single-agent atezolizumab, two-year DFS and OS were 68% (95% CI: 58–76) and 77% (95% CI: 68–85), respectively with two-year DFS in patients achieving a pathological complete response of 85% (95% CI: 65–94) [302]. In a update of PURE-01, after a median follow-up of 39 months, 36-month EFS and OS were 74% (95% CI: 68-82) and 84% (95% CI: 78-90), respectively with RFS in patients achieving a complete pathologic response of 96% (95% CI: 89-100) [303]. The combination of anti-CTLA4 and anti-PD1 therapy has also been investigated in the neoadjuvant setting. In the NABUCCO study using pre-operative ipilimumab and nivolumab, the pathologic complete response was 46% with 58% having no remaining invasive disease (pT0N0/pTisN0/pTaN0) [304]. In a second study using pre-operative tremelimumab and durvalumab in cisplatin-ineligible patients, the pathological complete response was 37.5% and downstaging to pT1 or less was seen in 58% of patients who completed surgery [305]. Three studies have been published to date investigating the use of neoadjuvant chemo-immunotherapy in patients with MIBC. In a phase II study of gemcitabine plus split-dose cisplatin and pembrolizumab in patients with MIBC, 22 of 39 patients (56% [95% CI: 40–72]) achieved < pT2N0 and 14 of 39 (36% [95% CI: 21–53]) achieved pT0N0 [306]. In a second phase II study evaluating neoadjuvant atezolizumab with gemcitabine and cisplatin; 27 of 39 patients (69%) were < pT2N0 and 16 (41%) pT0N0. No patient with < pT2N0 relapsed and four (11%) with ≥ pT2N0 relapsed with a median follow-up of 16.5 months (range: 7.0–33.7 months) [307]. A third phase II study evaluating NAC with GC plus durvalumab including adjuvant durvalumab with a primary endpoint of EFS demonstrated EFS at 3 years of 73% (95% CI, 59 to 83). Complete pathologic response was achieved in 17 of 52 patients (33%), and 31 (60%) had pathologic response <ypT2 ypN0. Overall survival (OS) was 81% (95% CI, 67 to 89) at 3 years. With the promising pathologic response rates, several larger studies are currently investigating the potential role for neoadjuvant chemo-immunotherapy in patients with MIBC [308]. At present, the results with immunotherapy alone, or in combination with chemotherapy, are promising but not yet approved in routine practice. 7.1.5. Summary of evidence and guidelines for neoadjuvant therapy Summary of evidenceLENeoadjuvant cisplatin-containing combination chemotherapy improves OS (8% at five years).1aNeoadjuvant treatment may have a major impact on OS in patients who achieve ypT0 or ≤ ypT2.2aCurrently immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors as monotherapy, or in different combinations with or without chemotherapy, is being tested in phase II and III trials. Initial results are promising.-There are still no reliable tools available to select patients who have a higher probability of benefitting from NAC. In the future, genetic markers in a personalised medicine setting might facilitate the selection of patients for NAC and differentiate responders from non-responders.- RecommendationsStrength ratingIf eligible for cisplatin-based chemotherapy, offer neoadjuvant cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy to patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (T2-T4a, cN0 M0).StrongDo not offer NAC to patients who are ineligible for cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy.StrongOnly offer neoadjuvant immunotherapy to patients within a clinical trial setting.Strong
