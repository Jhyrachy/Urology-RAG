5.2.6. Plant extracts – phytotherapy. Potential mechanism of action: Herbal drug preparations are made of roots, seeds, pollen, bark, or fruits. There are single plant preparations (mono-preparations) and preparations combining two or more plants in one pill (combination preparations) [268]. Possible relevant compounds include phytosterols, ß-sitosterol, fatty acids, and lectins [268]. In vitro, plant extracts can have anti-inflammatory, anti-androgenic and oestrogenic effects; decrease sexual hormone binding globulin; inhibit aromatase, lipoxygenase, growth factor-stimulated proliferation of prostatic cells, α-adrenoceptors, 5 α-reductase, muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, dihydropyridine receptors and vanilloid receptors; and neutralise free radicals [263,268,269]. The in vivo effects of these compounds are uncertain, and the precise mechanisms of plant extracts remain unclear. Efficacy: The extracts of the same plant produced by different companies do not necessarily have the same biological or clinical effects; therefore, the effects of one brand cannot be extrapolated to others [270]. In addition, batches from the same producer may contain different concentrations of active ingredients [271]. A review of recent extraction techniques and their impact on the composition/biological activity of available Serenoa repens based products showed that results from different clinical trials must be compared strictly according to the same validated extraction technique and/or content of active compounds [272], as the pharmacokinetic properties of the different preparations can vary significantly. Heterogeneity and a limited regulatory framework characterise the current status of phytotherapeutic agents. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has developed the Committee on Herbal Medicinal Products (HMPC). European Union (EU) herbal monographs contain the HMPC’s scientific opinion on safety and efficacy data about herbal substances and their preparations intended for medicinal use. The HMPC evaluates all available information, including non-clinical and clinical data, whilst also documenting long-standing use and experience in the EU. European Union monographs are divided into two sections: a) Well established use (marketing authorisation): when an active ingredient of a medicine has been used for more than ten years and its efficacy and safety have been well established (including a review of the relevant literature); and b) Traditional use (simplified registration): for herbal medicinal products which do not fulfil the requirements for a marketing authorisation, but there is sufficient safety data and plausible efficacy on the basis of long-standing use and experience. The HPMC periodically invites all interested parties to submit any scientific data that the Committee should consider during their periodic review of the monographs. Table 1 lists the available EU monographs for herbal medicinal products and the current calls for update.

Panel interpretation: Only hexane extracted Serenoa repens (HESr) has been recommended for well-established use by the HMPC. Based on this a detailed scoping search covering the timeframe between the search cut-off date of the EU monograph and May 2021 was conducted for HESr. A large meta-analysis of 30 RCTs with 5,222 men and follow-up ranging from four to 60 weeks, demonstrated no benefit of treatment with S. repens in comparison to placebo for the relief of LUTS [279]. It was concluded that S. repens was not superior to placebo, finasteride, or tamsulosin with regard to IPSS improvement, Qmax, or prostate size reduction; however, the similar improvement in IPSS or Qmax compared with finasteride or tamsulosin could be interpreted as treatment equivalence. Importantly, in the meta-analysis all different brands of S. repens were included regardless or not of the presence of HESr as the main ingredient in the extract. Another SR focused on data from twelve RCTs on the efficacy and safety of HESr [280]. It was concluded that HESr was superior to placebo in terms of improvement of nocturia and Qmax in patients with enlarged prostates. Improvement in LUTS was similar to tamsulosin and short-term use of finasteride. An updated SR analysed fifteen RCTs and also included twelve observational studies. It confirmed the results of the previous SR on the efficacy of HESr [281]. Compared with placebo, HESr was associated with 0.64 (95% CI: 0.98 - 0.31) fewer voids/night and an additional mean increase in Qmax of 2.75 mL/s (95% CI: 0.57 - 4.93), both were significant. When compared with α-blockers, HESr showed similar improvements in IPSS (WMD 0.57; 95% CI: 0.27 - 1.42) and a comparable increase in Qmax when compared to tamsulosin (WMD 0.02; 95% CI: 0.71 - 0.66). Efficacy assessed using IPSS was similar after six months of treatment between HESr and 5-ARIs. Analysis of all available published data for HESr showed a mean significant improvement in IPSS from baseline of 5.73 points (95% CI: 6.91 - 4.54) [281]. A network meta-analysis tried to compare the clinical efficacy of S. repens (HESr and non-HESr) against placebo and α1-blockers in men with LUTS. Interestingly, only two RCTs on HESr were included in the analysis. It was found that S. repens achieved no clinically meaningful improvement against placebo or α1-blockers in short-term follow-up. However, S. repens showed a clinical benefit after a prolonged period of treatment, and HESr demonstrated a greater improvement than non-HESr in terms of IPSS [282]. With respect to safety and tolerability data from the SRs showed that HESr had a favourable safety profile with gastrointestinal disorders being the most frequent adverse effects (mean incidence 3.8%) while HESr had very limited impact on sexual function. A cross-sectional study compared the combination of HESr with silodosin, to silodosin monotherapy in patients treated for at least twelve months (mean duration 13.5 months) [283]. It was reported that 69.9% of the combination therapy patients achieved the predefined clinically meaningful improvement (improvement more than three points in baseline IPSS) compared to 30.1% of patients treated only with silodosin. In addition, a greater than 25% improvement in IPSS was found in 68.8% and 31.2% of the patients in the combination and the monotherapy groups, respectively. These data suggest that combination of a α1-blocker with HESr may result in greater clinically meaningful improvements in LUTS compared to α1-blocker monotherapy [283]. Practical considerations: Available RCTs do not use the same endpoints (e.g., IPSS). More studies on the use of HESr in combination with other pharmacotherapeutic agents for male LUTS are pending. There is a need to define the subpopulation of patients who will benefit most from therapy with HESr. Summary of evidenceLEHexane extracted Serenoa repens improves Qmax and results in fewer voids/night (0.64 [95% CI: 0.98 to 0.31]) compared to placebo.2Hexane extracted Serenoa repens has a very limited negative impact on sexual function.2 RecommendationsStrength ratingOffer hexane extracted Serenoa repens to men with LUTS who want to avoid any potential adverse events especially related to sexual function.WeakInform the patient that the magnitude of efficacy may be modest.Strong
