3.2.5.5. Primary vaginal and vulvar pain syndromes. Pain in the vagina or the female external genital organs is often due to infection or trauma, as a consequence of childbirth or surgery. Pain is usually a precedent to dyspareunia. When the pain persists for more than three months, it can be diagnosed as primary vulvar pain syndrome previously known as “vulvodynia” or “chronic vaginal pain” with no known cause. It is still a poorly understood condition, and therefore difficult to treat. There are two main sub-types of primary vulvar pain syndrome: generalised, where the pain occurs in different areas of the vulva at different times; and focal, where the pain is at the entrance of the vagina. In primary generalised vulvar pain syndrome, the pain may be constant or occur occasionally, but touch or pressure does not initiate it, although it may make the pain worse. In primary focal vulvar pain syndrome, the pain is described as a burning sensation that comes on only after touch or pressure, such as during intercourse. The possible causes of primary vulvar pain syndrome involve a complex interplay between affective, behavioural and interpersonal factors such as: psychological factors, i.e. depressive symptoms, anxiety, pain-related fear and catastrophising [159,160] history of physical or sexual abuse;history of chronic antibiotic use;hypersensitivity to yeast infections, allergies to chemicals or other substances;abnormal inflammatory response (genetic and non-genetic) to infection and trauma;nerve or muscle injury or irritation;hormonal changes.
