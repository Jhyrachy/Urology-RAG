doxazosin mesylate (doxazosin); silodosin; tamsulosin hydrochloride (tamsulosin); terazosin hydrochloride (terazosin); naftopidil. alpha 1-blockers exist different formulations. although different formulations result different pharmacokinetic tolerability profiles, overall difference clinical efficacy difference formulations seems negligible. efficacy: indirect comparisons limited direct comparisons α1-blockers demonstrate α1-blockers similar efficacy appropriate doses . clinical effects take weeks develop fully, significant efficacy placebo occur within hours days . controlled studies show α1-blockers typically reduce ipss approximately 30-40% increase qmax approximately 20-25%. however, substantial improvements also occurred corresponding placebo arms . open-label studies, ipss improvement 50% qmax increase 40% documented . sr meta-analysis suggested qmax variation underestimates real effect α1-blockers bpo, small improvements qmax correspond relevant improvements boo index pfs . alpha 1-blockers reduce storage voiding luts. prostate size affect α1-blocker efficacy studies follow-up periods less one year, α1-blockers seem efficacious patients smaller prostates (< 40 ml) longer-term studies [65,161-164]. efficacy α1-blockers similar across age groups . pooled analysis phase iii iv trials silodosin 8 mg demonstrated improvements total, storage, voiding, qol ipss scores similar severe severe luts cohorts . addition, α1-blockers neither reduce prostate size prevent aur long-term studies [162-164];
