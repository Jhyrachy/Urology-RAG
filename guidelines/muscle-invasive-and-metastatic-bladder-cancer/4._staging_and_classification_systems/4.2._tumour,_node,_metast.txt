4.2. Tumour, node, metastasis classification. The TNM classification of malignant tumours is the method most widely used to classify the extent of cancer spread [83] (Table 4.1). Table 4.1: TNM Classification of urinary bladder cancer [83] T - Primary TumourTxPrimary tumour cannot be assessedT0No evidence of primary tumourTaNon-invasive papillary carcinomaTisCarcinoma in situ: “flat tumour”T1Tumour invades subepithelial connective tissueT2Tumour invades muscleT2aTumour invades superficial muscle (inner half)T2bTumour invades deep muscle (outer half)T3Tumour invades perivesical tissue:T3amicroscopicallyT3bmacroscopically (extravesical mass)T4Tumour invades any of the following: prostate stroma, seminal vesicles, uterus, vagina, pelvic wall, abdominal wallT4aTumour invades prostate stroma, seminal vesicles, uterus, or vaginaT4bTumour invades pelvic wall or abdominal wallN - Regional Lymph NodesNxRegional lymph nodes cannot be assessedN0No regional lymph node metastasisN1Metastasis in a single lymph node in the true pelvis (hypogastric, obturator, external iliac, or presacral)N2Metastasis in multiple regional lymph nodes in the true pelvis (hypogastric, obturator, external iliac, or presacral)N3Metastasis in a common iliac lymph node(s)M - Distant MetastasisM0No distant metastasisM1aNon-regional lymph nodesM1bOther distant metastasis Staging after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) and RC can be done, but must be mentioned as ypTNM (International Collaboration on Cancer Reporting) [86]. ypT0N0 after NAC and cystectomy is associated with better prognosis [71,87,88].
