4.2. Gleason score and International Society of Urological Pathology 2019 grade. In the original Gleason grading system, 5 Gleason grades (ranging from 1â€“5) based on histological tumour architecture were distinguished, but in the 2005 and subsequent 2014 ISUP consensus meetings Gleason grades 1 and 2 were eliminated [99,100]. The 2005 ISUP modified Gleason score (GS) of biopsy-detected PCa comprises the Gleason grade of the most extensive (primary) pattern, plus the second most common (secondary) pattern, if two are present. If only one pattern is present, it needs to be doubled to yield the GS. For three grades, the biopsy GS comprises the most common grade plus the highest grade, irrespective of its extent. In case intraductal carcinoma (IDC) is present intermixed with invasive PCa, it should be incorporated in the GS based on its underlying architectural pattern [101]. In addition to reporting of the carcinoma features for each biopsy side, an overall (or global) GS based on the carcinoma-positive biopsies can be provided. The global GS takes into account the cumulative extent of each grade from all prostate biopsies. The 2014 and 2019 ISUP endorsed a grading system limiting the number of PCa grades, ranging them from 1 to 5 (see Table 4.2) [100,102].
