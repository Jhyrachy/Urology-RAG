4.2. Premature ejaculation. The highest prevalence rate of 31% (men aged 18-59 years) was found by the National Health and Social Life Survey (NHSLS), which determines adult sexual behaviour in the USA [197]. Prevalence rates were 30% (18-29 years), 32% (30-39 years), 28% (40-49 years) and 55% (50-59 years), respectively. However, it is unlikely that the premature ejaculation (PE) prevalence is as high as 20-30% based on the relatively low number of men who seek medical help for PE. These high prevalence rates may be a result of the dichotomous scale (yes/no) in a single question asking if ejaculation occurred too early, as the prevalence rates in European studies have been significantly lower [198]. Two separate observational, cross-sectional surveys from different continents found that the overall prevalence of PE was 19.8 and 25.8%, respectively [199,200]. Further stratifying these complaints into the classifications defined by Waldinger et al., [201], rates of lifelong PE were 2.3 and 3.18%, acquired PE 3.9 and 4.48%, variable PE 8.5 and 11.38% and subjective PE 5.1 and 6.4%, respectively [199,200]. Both studies showed that men with acquired PE were more likely to seek treatment compared to men with lifelong PE.
