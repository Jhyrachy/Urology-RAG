5.4. Cytology and urinary markers. Abnormal cytology may indicate high-grade UTUC when bladder cystoscopy is normal, and in the absence of CIS in the bladder and prostatic urethra [1,97]. Voided urine cytology is less sensitive for UTUC than selectively obtained cytology from the affected upper tract [98]. In a recent study, barbotage cytology detected up to 91% of cancers [99]. Barbotage cytology taken from the renal cavities and ureteral lumina is preferred before application of a contrast agent for retrograde ureteropyelography as it may cause deterioration of cytological specimens [97,99]. Retrograde ureteropyelography remains an option to detect UTUCs [84,100,101]. The sensitivity of fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) for molecular abnormalities characteristic of UTUCs is approximately 72â€“84% [102,103]. In a systematic review, including 25 studies on cytology and urinary markers, cytology and FISH were most commonly used [104]. FISH had comparable specificity (80-100%) and a higher sensitivity (35-86%) compared to cytology (11-71%). However, considering the wide ranges in sensitivity and specificity for both cytology and FISH, the authors concluded that these test were suboptimal to rule out cancer/UTUC. A prospective study in 79 patients with suspicion of UTUC using upper tract urine collected just before URS, reported sensitivities for Xpert Bladder, FISH, Bladder Epicheck and cytology of 100%, 87%, 64% and 42% , respectively. Specificities were 4%, 82%, 79% and 94%, respectively [105]. FISH, Bladder Epicheck and cytology could be helpful as an ancillary tool to detect UTUC; however, further confirmation in well-designed prospective comparative trials is needed.
