1.1. Aims and Objectives. The European Association of Urology (EAU) Sexual and Reproductive Health Guidelines aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the medical aspects relating to sexual and reproductive health in adult men. These Guidelines cover the former EAU Guidelines on Male Sexual Dysfunction, Male Infertility and Male Hypogonadism. It must be emphasised that guidelines present the best evidence available to the experts. However, following guideline recommendations will not necessarily result in the best outcome. Guidelines can never replace clinical expertise when making treatment decisions for individual patients, but rather help to focus decisions - while taking personal values and preferences/individual circumstances of patients into account. Guidelines are not mandates and do not purport to be a legal standard of care.
