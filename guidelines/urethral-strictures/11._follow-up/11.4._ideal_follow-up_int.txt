11.4. Ideal follow-up interval after urethral surgery. The optimal follow-up strategy must allow for an objective determination of anatomic and functional outcomes to assess surgical success whilst avoiding excessive invasive testing that leads to unnecessary cost, discomfort, anxiety, and risk [560]. After anterior urethroplasty, 21% of recurrences are clinically evident, and cystoscopically confirmed, after three months [587] and 96% after one year [569]. Early recurrences are more frequent in patients with LS and older age, in longer strictures and when skin grafts were used [587].
