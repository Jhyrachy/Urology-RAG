3.3.5.3. pregnant women. 3.3.5.3.1. treatment abu beneficial pregnant women? twelve rcts comparing antibiotic treatments abu placebo controls treatment [33-44], different antibiotic doses regimens identified, ten published 1988 one 2015. eleven rcts (n=2,002) reported rate symptomatic utis [33,35-43,45]. antibiotic treatment significantly reduced number symptomatic utis compared placebo treatment (average rr 0.22, 95% ci 0.12 0.40). six rcts reported resolution bacteriuria [33-35,37,40,42]. antibiotic treatment effective resolution bacteriuria compared placebo (average rr 2.99, 95% ci 1.65 5.39; n=716). eight rcts reported rate low birthweights [33,35-38,41,44,45]. antibiotic treatment associated lower rates low birthweight compared placebo treatment (average rr 0.58, 95% ci 0.36 0.94; n=1689). four rcts reported rate preterm deliveries . antibiotic treatment associated lower rates preterm delivery compared placebo treatment (average rr 0.34, 95% ci 0.18 0.66; n=854). three additional systematic reviews meta-analyses reported treatment abu pregnancy may associated decreased rate pyelonephritis, low birthweight preterm delivery [46-48]. however, also emphasised low low quality evidence identified studies. based beneficial maternal foetal effects antibiotic treatment pregnant women screened treated abu. however, panel would like emphasise available studies low methodological quality 60s 80s. diagnostic treatment protocols accessibility medical services dramatically changed since then; therefore, quality evidence recommendation low. newer study higher methodological quality beneficial effects antibiotic treatment evident . therefore, advisable consult national recommendations pregnant women. 3.3.5.3.2. treatment duration applied treat abu pregnancy? sixteen rcts comparing efficacy different antibiotic treatments pregnant women abu identified [49-64]. significant heterogeneity amongst studies. studies compared different antibiotic regimens antibiotic regimens different durations. duration treatment ranged single dose continuous treatment (until delivery). practical purposes grouping strategy used previously published cochrane review widmer et al. adopted modifications . following treatment groups used comparison: single dose (single day);short course (2-7 days);long course (8-14 days);continuous (until delivery). nine studies compared single dose short course treatment [50,54,55,59-64], one study compared single dose long course treatment one study compared long course continuous treatment . long term continuous antibiotic treatment used current practice, studies comparing single dose standard short course treatment presented. 3.3.5.3.2.1. single dose vs. short course treatment three rcts reported rate symptomatic utis , significant difference two durations (average rr 1.07, 95% ci 0.47 2.47; n=891). nine rcts reported rate abu resolution [50,54,55,59-64], significant difference two durations (average rr 0.97, 95% ci 0.89 1.07; n=1,268). six rcts reported rate side effects . single dose treatment associated significantly less side effects compared short course treatment (average rr 0.40, 95% ci 0.22 0.72; n=458). three rcts reported rate preterm deliveries , significant difference two durations (average rr 1.16, 95% ci 0.75 1.78; n=814). one rct reported rate low birthweights . significantly babies low birthweight single dose duration compared short course treatment (average rr 1.65, 95% ci 1.06 2.57; n=714). according data analysis, single dose treatment associated significantly lower rate side effects significantly higher rate low birthweight. meta-analysis use single dose fosfomycin trometamol women lower uncomplicated utis abu reported subgroup analysis pregnant women abu . study identified five rcts involving 577 patients. resolution rate abu pregnant women treated single dose fosfomycin trometamol significantly different received antibiotics (or 1.32, 95% ci 0.78â€“2.22, p=0.30). therefore, standard short course treatment single dose fosfomycin trometamol applied treat abu pregnancy; however, emphasised overall quality scientific evidence backing recommendation low.
