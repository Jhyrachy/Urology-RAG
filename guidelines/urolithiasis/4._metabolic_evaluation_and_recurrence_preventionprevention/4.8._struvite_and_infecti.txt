4.8. Struvite and infection stones. All infection-stone formers are deemed at high risk of recurrence. Struvite stones represent 2-15% of the stones sent for analysis. Stones that contain struvite may originate de novo or grow on pre-existing stones, which are infected with urea-splitting bacteria [662]. There are several factors predisposing patients to struvite stone formation (Table 4.9) [663]. Several studies have reported that urinary metabolic alterations can be disclosed in 36-81% of patients with mixed struvite stones [664-669]. 4.8.1. Diagnosis Blood analysis requires measurement of creatinine, and urinalysis requires repeat urine pH measurements and urine culture. In cases of mixed struvite stones, the search for metabolic abnormalities in 24-hour urine after stone removal and infection control is suggested. 4.8.2. Interpretation Infection stones contain the following minerals: struvite and/or carbonate apatite and/or ammonium urate. Urine culture typically provides evidence for urease-producing bacteria, which increase ammonia ions and develop alkaline urine (Table 4.10). Carbonate apatite starts to crystallise at a urine pH level of 6.8. Struvite only precipitates at pH > 7.2 [670,671]. A mixed struvite stone, i.e., containing a high percentage of calcium oxalate and carbonate apatite, suggests the over-infection of a “metabolic” calcium oxalate or calcium phosphate stone [669]. Proteus mirabilis accounts for more than half of all urease positive UTIs [672,673]. 4.8.3. Specific treatment General preventive measures are recommended for fluid intake and diet. Specific measures include complete surgical stone removal [663], short- or long-term antibiotic treatment [674], and urinary acidification using methionine [602] or ammonium chloride [675]. For persistent infections/colonisation, acetohydroxamic acid may be an option [676,677] (Figure 4.8); however, it is not licensed/available in all European countries. Eradication of infection after complete stone removal is desirable. The evidence regarding the duration of post-operative antibiotic administration is inconclusive. Summary of evidenceLERemoving the stone material as completely as possible with surgery can reduce ongoing infection.3Antibiotics are beneficial after complete stone removal.3Ammonium chloride, 1 g, two or three times daily, can ensure urinary acidification to prevent recurrent infection.3Methionine, 200-500 mg, one to three times daily, can be used as an alternative to ammonium chloride, to ensure urinary acidification.3Treatment of underlying metabolic abnormalities reduces recurrence of mixed struvite stones.3Urease inhibitors in case of severe infection are occasionally used (if licensed).1b RecommendationsStrength ratingSurgically remove the stone material as completely as possible.StrongPrescribe antibiotics in case of persistent bacteriuria.StrongPrescribe ammonium chloride, 1 g, two or three times daily to ensure urinary acidification.WeakPrescribe methionine, 200-500 mg, one to three times daily, as an alternative, to ensure urinary acidification.Weak Table 4.9: Factors predisposing to struvite stone formation.
