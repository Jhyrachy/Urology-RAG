3.3. histology classification. 3.3.1. histological types upper urinary tract tumours almost always ucs pure non-urothelial histology rare . however, histological subtypes present approximately 25% utucs . pure squamous cell carcinoma urinary tract often assumed associated chronic inflammatory diseases infections arising urolithiasis . urothelial carcinoma divergent squamous differentiation (i.e., squamous subtype) present approximately 15% cases . keratinising squamous metaplasia urothelium risk factor squamous cell cancers therefore mandates surveillance. upper urinary tract ucs different subtypes high- grade worse prognosis compared pure uc . subtypes, although rare, include sarcomatoid inverted growth also frequent uut . collecting duct carcinomas, may seem share similar characteristics ucs, display unique transcriptomic signature similar renal cancer, putative cell origin distal convoluted tubules. therefore, collecting duct carcinomas considered renal tumours .
