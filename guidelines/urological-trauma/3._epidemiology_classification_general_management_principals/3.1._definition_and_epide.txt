3.1. Definition and Epidemiology. Trauma is defined as a physical injury or a wound to living tissue caused by an extrinsic agent. Worldwide, there are over four million injury-related deaths ever year which constitute nearly 8% of all deaths [10]. About 25% of them are violence related. For young people (5 - 29 years old), three of the top five causes of death are injury-related (road traffic injuries, homicide, and suicide). Tens of millions more people suffer non-fatal injuries each year which lead to acute care visits, hospitalizations, and often result in temporary or permanent disability and the need for long-term physical and mental health care and rehabilitation. Twice as many males than females are killed each year because of injuries and violence [10]. Trauma is therefore a serious public health problem with significant social and economic costs. Considerable variation exists in the causes and the effects of traumatic injuries between geographical areas, as well as between low, middle, and high-income countries with about 90% of injury-related deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries [10].
