3.5.2. Diagnostic evaluation. Recurrent UTIs are common. Risk factors are outlined in Table 2. Initial diagnosis of rUTI should be confirmed by urine culture. An extensive routine workup including cystoscopy, imaging, etc. is not routinely recommended as the diagnostic yield is low [144]. However, it should be performed without delay in atypical cases, for example, if renal calculi, outflow obstruction, interstitial cystitis or urothelial cancer is suspected.
