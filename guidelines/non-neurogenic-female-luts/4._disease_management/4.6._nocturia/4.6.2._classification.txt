4.6.2. Classification. Classification of nocturia is dependent on bladder diary analysis and several parameters have been defined as important [591]: nocturnal urine volume – total volume of urine passed during the night (this includes the first morning void but does not include the last void prior to sleep);maximum voided volume – largest single voided volume in 24 hours;nocturia index – nocturnal urine volume divided by maximum voided volume;nocturnal polyuria index – nocturnal urine volume divided by 24-hour urine volume;nocturnal urine production – nocturnal urine volume divided by duration of sleep, in hours. Analysis of these parameters allows clinical classification of nocturia based on physiological abnormalities that can cause nocturia: 24-hour polyuria;nocturnal polyuria;diminished bladder capacity;sleep disorders.
