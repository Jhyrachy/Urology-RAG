7.1. Unmet needs. Penile cancer has a significant impact on QoL and unfortunately there remain many unmet needs to address (see Table 1.1 in Chapter 1) [2]. The physical changes, along with the psychological and emotional stress that men with penile cancer suffer requires recognition and professional support before, during and after treatment. Holistic patient support services delivered by a multi-disciplinary team as a routine part of surveillance and follow-up should be standard of care. Patients with cancer endorse of the need for ‘adjustment’ and dealing with the ‘new normal’ as part of survivorship [302]. The extent of this and the time it takes varies from person to person and it is important to realise that some unmet needs may not become an issue until much later on.
