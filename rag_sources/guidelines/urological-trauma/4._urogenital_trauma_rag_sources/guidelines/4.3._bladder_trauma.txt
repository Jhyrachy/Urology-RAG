4.3. bladder trauma. 4.3.1. classification bladder trauma primarily classified according location injury: intraperitoneal, extraperitoneal, combined intra-extraperitoneal , guides management . bladder trauma categorised aetiology: non-iatrogenic (blunt penetrating) iatrogenic (external internal). 4.3.2. epidemiology, aetiology, pathophysiology road traffic accidents (motor vehicle accidents) common cause blunt bladder injury, followed falls accidents. main mechanisms pelvic crush blows lower abdomen . patients blunt bladder injury associated pelvic fractures (60-90%) intra-abdominal injuries (44-68.5%) . pelvic fractures associated bladder injury 3% cases ; however, high 26.5% cases severe pelvic injury . bladder injury associated urethral injury 5-20% cases . incidence extraperitoneal (22.4-61.1%), intraperitoneal (38.9-65.8%) injuries varies among series . extraperitoneal injury almost always associated pelvic fractures . usually caused distortion pelvic ring, shearing anterolateral bladder wall near bladder base (at fascial attachments), contrecoup opposite side. highest risk bladder injury found disruptions pelvic circle displacement > 1 cm, diastasis pubic symphysis > 1 cm, pubic rami fractures . occasionally, bladder directly perforated sharp bony fragment . intraperitoneal injury caused sudden rise intravesical pressure distended bladder, secondary blow pelvis lower abdomen. bladder dome weakest point bladder ruptures usually occur . penetrating injuries, mainly gunshot wounds, rare except conflict zones violent urban areas . improvised explosive devices main cause combat related bladder injuries asymmetric warfare . 4.3.2.1. iatrogenic bladder trauma (ibt) bladder urological organ commonly affected iatrogenic injury . table 4.3.1 shows incidence ibt various procedures. external ibt occurs often obstetric gynaecological procedures, followed urological general surgical operations . main risk factors previous surgery, inflammation malignancy . bladder perforations occur 4.9% mid-urethral sling operations stress urinary incontinence women. rate significantly lower obturator route compared retropubic route . internal ibt mainly occurs transurethral resection bladder (turb). reported risk factors larger tumours, older age, pre-treated bladders (previous turb, intravesical instillations) location bladder dome . tumours lateral wall pose risk factor obturator jerk . extraperitoneal perforations frequent intraperitoneal perforations , perforations requiring intervention rare (0.16-0.57%) . table 4.3.1:

4.3.3. diagnostic evaluation principal sign bladder injury visible haematuria . absolute indications bladder imaging include: visible haematuria pelvic fracture non-visible haematuria combined high-risk pelvic fracture (disruption pelvic circle displacement > 1 cm diastasis pubic symphysis > 1 cm) posterior urethral injury . bladder trauma also suspected patients blunt urethral trauma high injury severity score (iss) . absence absolute indications, imaging based clinical signs symptoms including : inability void inadequate urine output;abdominal tenderness distension due urinary ascites, signs urinary ascites abdominal imaging;uraemia elevated creatinine level due intraperitoneal re-absorption;entry/exit wounds lower abdomen, perineum, buttocks penetrating injuries. intra-operative signs external iatrogenic bladder injury include: extravasation urine, visible laceration, visible bladder catheter, blood and/or gas urine bag laparoscopy . direct inspection reliable method assessing bladder integrity . retrograde bladder filling (with without instillation dye e.g., methylene blue) helps detect smaller lesions . bladder perforation close trigone, ureteric orifices inspected . internal bladder injury recognised cystoscopic identification fatty tissue, dark space, bowel . may also detected inability distend bladder, low return irrigation fluid, abdominal distension . post-operatively, missed bladder trauma diagnosed haematuria, abdominal pain, abdominal distension, ileus, peritonitis, sepsis, urine leakage wound, decreased urinary output, increased serum creatinine . ibt hysterectomy caesarean delivery result vesicovaginal vesicouterine fistulae . 4.3.3.1. cystography cystography preferred diagnostic modality non-iatrogenic bladder injury suspected ibt post-operative setting . plain ct cystography comparable sensitivity (90-95%) specificity (100%) . however, ct cystography superior identification bony fragments bladder bladder neck injuries, well concomitant abdominal injuries . cystography must performed using retrograde filling bladder minimum volume 300-350 ml dilute contrast material . passive bladder filling clamping urinary catheter excretory phase ct ivp sufficient exclude bladder injury . intraperitoneal extravasation visualised free contrast medium abdomen outlining bowel loops abdominal viscera . extraperitoneal bladder injury typically diagnosed flame-shaped areas contrast extravasation peri-vesical soft tissues. contrast medium vagina sign vesicovaginal fistula . 4.3.3.2. cystoscopy cystoscopy preferred method detection intra-operative bladder injuries may directly visualise laceration localise lesion relation position trigone ureteral orifices . lack bladder distension cystoscopy suggests large perforation. cystoscopy recommended detect perforation bladder (or urethra) following retropubic sub-urethral sling operations . routine intra-operative cystoscopy gynaecologic procedures recommended , although threshold perform low suspected bladder injury. 4.3.4. prevention risk bladder injury reduced emptying bladder urethral catheterisation every procedure bladder risk . furthermore, catheterâ€™s balloon aid identification bladder . turb tumours lateral wall, incidence internal ibt reduced obturator nerve block adequate muscle relaxation . conflicting evidence whether bipolar turb reduce risk obturator jerk . use combat pelvic protection systems reduces risk bladder genitourinary injuries due blast mechanism improvised explosivedevices . 4.3.5. disease management 4.3.5.1. conservative management conservative treatment, comprises clinical observation, continuous bladder drainage antibiotic prophylaxis , standard treatment uncomplicated extraperitoneal injury due toblunt iatrogenic trauma . conservative treatment also chosen uncomplicated intraperitoneal injury turb operations, absence peritonitis ileus . placement intraperitoneal

absorbable sutures . evidence two-layer superior watertight single-layer closure . 4.3.5.2.1. blunt non-iatrogenic trauma extraperitoneal ruptures treated conservatively; however, bladder neck

rectal injuries, usually requiring faecal diversion . gunshot wounds associated two transmural injuries (entry exit wounds) bladder carefully checked two lesions . penetrating agent (bullet, knife) sterile, antibiotic treatment advised . selected patients (haemodynamically stable without associated injuries), penetrating well-contained extraperitoneal bladder injuries probably safely managed non-operatively . 4.3.5.2.3. iatrogenic bladder trauma perforations lacerations intra-operatively primarily closed . bladder injuries recognised surgery internal ibt managed according location. standard care intraperitoneal injuries surgical exploration repair . surgical exploration performed turb, bowel must inspected rule concomitant injury . extraperitoneal injuries, exploration needed perforations complicated symptomatic extravesical collections. requires drainage collection, without closure perforation . bladder perforation encountered mid-urethral sling transvaginal mesh procedures, sling re-insertion urethral catheterisation (two seven days) performed . 4.3.6. follow-up continuous bladder drainage required prevent elevated intravesical pressure allow bladder heal . conservatively treated bladder injuries (traumatic external ibt) followed cystography rule extravasation ensure proper bladder healing . first cystography planned approximately ten days injury . case ongoing leakage, cystoscopy performed rule bony fragments bladder, second cystography warranted one week later . operative repair simple injury healthy patient, catheter removed five ten days without cystography . cases complex injury (trigone involvement, ureteric re-implantation) risk factors impaired wound healing (e.g., steroids, malnutrition) cystography advised . conservatively treated internal ibt, catheter drainage, lasting five seven days, proposed . 4.3.7. summary evidence recommendations bladder injury summary evidencelethe combination pelvic fracture visible haematuria highly
