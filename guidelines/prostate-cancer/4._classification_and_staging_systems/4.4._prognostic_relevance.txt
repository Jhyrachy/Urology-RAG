4.4. Prognostic relevance of stratification. Tumour, Node, Metastasis (TNM) staging is a schematic representation of anatomic tumour extent and pathological grade is reflective of intrinsic features of tumour aggressiveness. EAU risk group classification, which is essentially based on D’Amico’s classification system for PCa, combines clinical information on tumour extent, PSA and pathology from systematic biopsy (Table 4.3). A more precise stratification of the clinically heterogeneous subset of intermediate-risk group patients could provide a better framework for their management [125,126]. Specifically, the NCCN Guidelines subdivide intermediate-risk disease into favourable and unfavourable intermediate-risk, with unfavourable features including ISUP grade group 3, and/or ≥ 50% positive systematic biopsy cores and/or at least two intermediate-risk factors [119]. In 2016 Cambridge Prognostic Groups representing a 5-tier model based on ISUP grade group, PSA and cT-stage were shown to have significantly better discriminative performance than current 3-tier EAU risk groups for prostate cancer specific mortality [127]. This model separates both EAU intermediate- and high-risk groups in clinically relevant subgroups and has been validated in several cohorts [127-129].
