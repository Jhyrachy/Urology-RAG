7.5. Locally-recurrent RCC after treatment of localised disease. Most studies reporting on local recurrent disease after removal of the kidney have not considered the true definition of local recurrence after RN, PN and thermal ablation, which are: local recurrence in the tumour- bearing kidney, tumour growth exclusively confined to the true renal fossa, recurrences within the renal vein, the ipsilateral adrenal gland or the regional LNs. In the existing literature the topic is weakly investigated and often regarded as local recurrent disease. RECUR is a protocol-based multicentre European registry capturing patient and tumour characteristics, risk of recurrence (RoR), recurrence patterns, and survival of those curatively treated for nonmetastatic RCC from 2006 to 2011. Per-protocol resectable disease (RD) recurrence was defined as (1) solitary metastases, (2) oligometastases, or (3) renal fossa or renal recurrence after radical or partial nephrectomy, respectively. Within the RECUR consortium, the authors assessed the effectiveness of local treatment of resectable recurrent RCC after surgical treatment of the primary kidney tumour [618]. Of 3039 patients with localised RCC treated with curative intent, 505 presented with recurrence, including 176 with RD. Of these patients, 97 underwent local treatment of recurrence (LTR) and 79 no LTR. The median OS was 70.3 mo versus 27.4 in the LTR versus no-LTR group (p < 0.001). The LTR effect on survival was consistent across risk groups. OS HR for high, intermediate, and low risks were 0.36 (0.2-0.64), 0.27 (0.11-0.65), and 0.26 (0.08-0.8), respectively. Local treatment of recurrence was associated with longer survival across groups with a risk of recurrence [618] 7.5.1. Locally-recurrent RCC after nephron-sparing approaches Locally-recurrent disease can affect the tumour-bearing kidney after PN or focal ablative therapy such as RFA and cryotherapy. Local relapse may be due to the incomplete resection of the primary tumour, in a minority of the cases to the local spread of the tumour by microvascular embolisation, or true multifocality [214,619]. The prognosis of recurrent disease not due to multifocality is poor, despite salvage nephrectomy [619]. Recurrent tumour growth in the regional LNs or ipsilateral adrenal gland may reflect metachronous metastatic spread (see Section 7.3). After treatment solely for localised disease, systemic progression is common [620,621]. There are reports that minimally invasive approaches (laparoscopic and robotic) show atypical reoccurence (e.g. peritoneal, port site, etc) [622,623]. Therefore, specific maneuvers to prevent tumour-cell contamination should be implemented. Those include the use of extraction bags, minimising trocar CO2 leakage, avoiding tumour morcellation, cleansing of instruments before reuse, changing of gloves after tumour extraction, avoiding violation of the tumor’s natural capsule, and cleansing of port sites [622,623]. A retrospective study relying on inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) and comparing percutaneous ablation (PCA) and surgical resection (SR) for an isolated local recurrence (LR) following PN [624]. A total of 81 patients with an isolated LR were included. Percutaneous ablation was associated with a lower risk of post-operative complications (odds ratio=0.22; p = 0.006) and a smaller change in eGFR. There were no significant differences in the risk of disease, new LR (HR = 1.51; p = 0.59), and distant metastasis (HR = 0.19; p = 0.09) [624]. Following thermal ablation or cryotherapy generally intra-renal, but also peri-renal, recurrences have been reported in up to 14% of cases [625]. Whereas repeat ablation is still recommended as the preferred therapeutic option after treatment failure, the most effective salvage procedure as an alternative to complete nephrectomy has not yet been defined. 7.5.2. Locally-recurrent RCC after radical nephrectomy Isolated local fossa recurrence is rare and occurs in about 1-3% after radical nephrectomy. More commonly in pT3-4 than pT1-2 and grade III-IV disease. Most patients with local recurrence of RCC are diagnosed by either CT/MRI scans as part of the post-operative follow-up [626]. The median time to recurrence after RN was 19-36 months in isolated local recurrence or 14.5 months in the group including metastatic cases as well [626-628]. Isolated local recurrence is associated with worse survival [214,629]. Based on retrospective and non-comparative data only, several approaches such as surgical excision, radiotherapy, systemic treatment and observation have been suggested for the treatment of isolated local recurrence [630-632]. Among these alternatives, surgical resection with negative margins remains the only therapeutic option shown to be associated with improved survival [629]. Open surgery has been successfully reported in studies [633,634]. One of the largest series including 2,945 patients treated with RN reported on 54 patients with recurrent disease localised in the renal fossa, the ipsilateral adrenal gland or the regional LNs as sole metastatic sites [630]. Another series identified 33 patients with isolated local recurrences and 30 local recurrences with synchronous metastases within a cohort of 2,502 surgically treated patients, confirming the efficacy of locally directed treatment vs. conservative approaches (observation, systemic therapy) [635] The 5-year OS with isolated local recurrence was 60% (95% CI: 0.44-0.73) and 10-year OS was 32% (95% CI: 0.15-0.51). Overall survival differed significantly by the time period between primary surgery and occurrence of recurrence (< 2 years vs. > 2 years: 10-year OS rate 31% (95% CI: 10.2-55.0) vs. 45% (95% CI: 21.5-65.8; HR: 0.26; p = 0.0034) [626]. Metastatic progression was observed in 60 patients (58.8%) after surgery [627]. Patient survival can be linked to the type of treatment received, as shown in a cohort of 96 patients, 45.8% were metastatic at the time of recurrence; three-year CSS rates after local recurrence were 92.3% ± 7.4%) for those who were treated with surgery and systemic therapy, 63.2% ± 13.2%) for those who only underwent surgery, 22.7% ± 0.9%) for those who only received systemic therapy and 20.5% ± 10.4%) for those who received no treatment (p < 0.001) [628]. A retrospective multi-centre study of patients with Local Retroperitoneal Recurrence (RPR) after radical nephrectomy (RN) with or without surgical treatment from 2008 to 2020. Retroperitoneal Recurrence of RCC was defined as an ipsilateral recurrence confined to the renal fossa, adrenal gland or retroperitoneal lymph nodes after prior nephrectomy, which was diagnosed by cross-sectional imaging. Treatment with RPR surgery resulted in significantly longer CSS than targeted therapy alone(P < .001). In multivariable analysis, high Fuhrman grade, size of RPR tumour, mixed type of RPR, multiple recurrence lesions and the absence of RPR surgery were associated with a significantly increased risk of death from RCC, suggesting that an aggressive surgical resection of RPR after RN represents a potentially curative treatment for selected RCC patients without synchronous metastases, resulting in significantly longer CSS than targeted therapy alone [636]. Minimally-invasive approaches, including standard and hand-assisted laparoscopic- and robotic approaches for the resection of isolated RCC recurrences have been occasionally reported. A large surgical cohort published of robotic surgery in this setting (n = 35) providing a standardisation of the nomenclature, describing the surgical technique for each scenario and reporting on complications, renal function, and oncologic outcomes [637]. Ablative therapies including cryoablation, radiofrequency and microwave ablation, may also have a role in managing recurrent RCC patients, but further validation will be needed [638,639]. In summary, the limited available evidence suggests that in selected patients surgical removal of locally- recurrent disease with negative margins can induce durable tumour control, although with expected high risk of complications. A retrospective review on 51 planned repeat PNs in 47 patients with locally-recurrent disease, reporting a total of 40 peri-operative complications, with temporary urinary extravasation being the most prevalent [640]. Since local recurrences develop early, with a median time interval of 10-20 months after treatment of the primary tumour [641], a guideline-adapted follow-up scheme for early detection is recommended (see Chapter 8 - Follow-up) even though benefit in terms of cancer control has not yet been demonstrated [642]. Adverse prognostic parameters are a short time interval since treatment of the primary tumour (< 3-12 months) [643], sarcomatoid differentiation of the recurrent lesion and incomplete surgical resection [630]. In case complete surgical removal is unlikely to be performed or when significant comorbidities are present (especially when combined with poor prognostic tumour features), palliative therapeutic approaches including radiation therapy aimed at symptom control and prevention of local complications should be considered (see Sections 7.3 and 7.4). Following metastasectomy of local recurrence after nephrectomy, adjuvant therapy can be considered (see Section 7.2.5. Neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy). Local recurrence combined with other metastases is treated as a metastatic RCC. 7.5.3.
