3.1.10.5. Inhibitors of the mammalian target of rapamycin (m-TOR). The immunosuppressants, sirolimus and everolimus, inhibit the mammalian target of rapamycin and suppress lymphocyte proliferation and differentiation [243,279,306-308]. They inhibit multiple intracellular pathways and block cytokine signals for T-cell proliferation. Similar effects are seen on B-cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and tumour cells. Inhibitors of m-TOR are as effective as MPA when combined with CNIs in preventing rejection [243,246,279,306-309]. However, m-TOR inhibitors exhibit dose-dependent bone marrow toxicity [243,279,306-308]. Other potential side effects include hyperlipidaemia, oedema, development of lymphoceles, wound-healing problems, pneumonitis, proteinuria, and impaired fertility. The extensive side effect profile is responsible for inferior tolerability compared to MPA and potential differences in outcome in early years, when higher doses were used [310-315]. To date, no prospective comparative studies have been carried out on the m-TOR inhibitors sirolimus and everolimus [316]. Both m-TOR inhibitors have an almost identical side effect profile and mainly differ in their pharmacokinetic properties [243,279,306-308,317]. Sirolimus has a half-life of about 60 hours, is given once a day and is licensed for prophylaxis in kidney recipients only. Everolimus has a half-life of about 24 hours, is licensed for kidney, liver and heart recipients and is given twice a day. Everolimus is licenced for use with cyclosporine and can be given simultaneously with cyclosporine, while sirolimus should be given four hours after cyclosporine. The pharmacological drug-drug interaction with cyclosporine is far less relevant for tacrolimus, resulting in the need for a higher starting dose of m-TOR inhibitors in combination with tacrolimus [260,318,319]. Sirolimus is also licensed in combination therapy with steroids for cyclosporine withdrawal from combination therapy with cyclosporine. Therapeutic monitoring of trough levels is recommended because of the narrow therapeutic window and the risk of drug-to-drug interactions [243,279,306-308,317]. When combined with CNIs, antimicrobial prophylaxis for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia should be administered for one year following transplantation, e.g. low-dose cotrimoxazole [243,306-308]. Most importantly, combination therapy with CNIs aggravates CNI-induced nephrotoxicity, although m-TOR inhibitors themselves are non-nephrotoxic [243]. Several studies suggest less favourable outcomes and increased drug discontinuations due to adverse events for this combination, especially if CNIs are maintained at standard dosages [243,246,248,260,309,311,312,320-325]. Calcineurin inhibitor dosage should therefore be substantially reduced in combination therapy with m-TOR inhibitors, which seems to have no impact on efficacy, due to the highly synergistic potential of this combination therapy [279,306-308,314,317]. Several studies suggest m-TOR inhibitors cannot replace CNIs in the initial phase after transplantation due to lower efficacy and a less favourable side effect profile, particularly wound healing problems and lymphoceles [241,243,244,276,300,301,306,308,316]. Other trials suggest that m-TOR inhibitors may replace CNI at later stages, e.g. three months after transplantation, with improvements in renal function, predominately in cyclosporine treated patients [243,245,246,248,258,279,306-308,311,312,314,326-328]. It is unclear if there is a real benefit in comparison to patients on tacrolimus and MPA [258,327]. However, there is an increased risk of rejection and development of HLA antibodies [243,245,258,279,329], which may be offset by the benefit of the non-nephrotoxic immunosuppression. Patients treated with m-TOR inhibitors develop less leucopenia and opportunistic viral infections, especially less CMV infections compared to MPA [260,311,314,324-326,330]. Proteinuria and poor renal function at conversion are associated with inferior outcomes [243,245,279,306-308]. Conversion from CNIs is not advisable in patients with proteinuria > 800 mg/day, and a cautious and individual approach should be followed in patients with GFR < 30 mL/min. Due to an anti-proliferative effect and a lower incidence of malignancy in m-TOR inhibitor treated patients, conversion from CNIs to m-TOR inhibitors may be beneficial for patients, who develop malignancy after transplantation, or who are at a high risk for the development of post-transplant malignancy or skin cancer [243,245,279,306-308,313-315,331-334]. Several studies and case reports have suggested that patients with Kaposi sarcoma under CNI therapy benefit from conversion to an m-TOR inhibitor [332]. In summary, m-TOR inhibitors are not recommended as initial immunosuppressive therapy due to their side effect profile and higher discontinuation rates [244]. However, m-TOR inhibitors are a well-studied alternative treatment option. Summary of evidenceLECombination therapy with CNIs aggravates CNI-induced nephrotoxicity. Therefore, CNI dosage should be substantially reduced in combination therapy with m-TOR inhibitors, which seems to have no impact on efficacy, due to the highly synergistic potential of this combination therapy.1Take into consideration impaired wound healing and prophylactic surgical measures when m-TOR inhibitors are used as part of the initial immunosuppressive regimen or when patients treated with m-TOR inhibitors undergo major surgery.1When combined with CNIs, antimicrobial prophylaxis for P. jirovecii pneumonia should be administered for one year following transplantation.1Conversion from CNIs is not advisable in patients with proteinuria > 800 mg/day, and a cautious and individual approach should be followed in patients with GFR < 30 mL/min.1 RecommendationsStrength ratingThe m-TOR inhibitors may be used to prevent rejection in patients who are intolerant to standard therapy.WeakSignificantly reduce calcineurin inhibitor dosage in a combination regimen withm-TOR inhibitors to prevent aggravated nephrotoxicity.StrongDo not convert patients with proteinuria and poor renal function to m-TOR inhibitors.StrongMonitor blood-levels of both sirolimus and everolimus to allow for appropriate dose adjustment.Strong
