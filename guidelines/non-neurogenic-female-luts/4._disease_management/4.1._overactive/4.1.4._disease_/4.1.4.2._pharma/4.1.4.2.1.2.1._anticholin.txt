4.1.4.2.1.2.1. Anticholinergic drugs in combination with other conservative treatment versus anticholinergic drugs alone. The combination of BT and solifenacin in female patients with OAB confers no additional benefit in terms of continence compared with solifenacin monotherapy [175]. A recent Cochrane review on the benefit of adding PFMT to other active treatments of UI in women showed insufficient evidence of any benefit in adding PFMT to drug treatment [176]. One SR identified thirteen RCTs comparing outcomes of antimuscarinic mono-therapy with combinations of antimuscarinics plus adjunct treatments including topical oestrogen, pregabalin, Stroller neurostimulation (SANS), PFMT, and behavioural therapy. Antimuscarinics alone were less effective than a combination of antimuscarinics plus another treatment modality in reducing urgency episodes, UUI episodes, frequency and nocturia episodes and in improving the mean symptoms score but no significant differences were found in rates of dry mouth, constipation or voiding dysfunction [11].
