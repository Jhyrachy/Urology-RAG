4.2. General considerations for recurrence prevention. All stone formers, independent of their individual risk, should follow the preventive measures in Table 4.5. The main focus is the normalisation of dietary habits and lifestyle risks. Stone formers at high risk need specific prophylaxis for recurrence, which is usually pharmacological treatment based on stone analysis and urinary risk profile. Table 4.5: General Preventive Measures General Preventive MeasuresFluid intake (drinking advice)Fluid amount: 2.5-3.0 L/dayWater is the preferred fluidDiuresis: 2.0-2.5 L/daySpecific weight of urine: < 1,010 g/dayNutritional advice for a balanced dietBalanced diet*Rich in vegetables and fibreNormal calcium content: 1-1.2 g/dayLimited NaCl content: 4-5 g/dayLimited animal protein content: 0.8-1.0 g/kg/dayLifestyle advise to normalise general risk factorsRetain a normal BMI levelAdequate physical activityBalancing of excessive fluid lossReduce the intake of alcohol containing fluidsReduce the intake of sodas and calorie-containing fluids Caution: Protein requirements are age dependent; therefore, protein restriction in childhood should be handled carefully.* Avoid excessive consumption of vitamin supplements. 4.2.1. Fluid intake An inverse relationship between high fluid intake and stone formation has been repeatedly demonstrated [556-560]. The beneficial effect of fruit juices is mainly determined by the presence of citrate or bicarbonate [561]. Citrus fruit juices seem to protect against stone disease either by increasing urinary citrate levels or by having an alkalinising effect on it [562]. However, if potassium is present, both pH and citrate are increased [563,564]. One large moderate-quality RCT randomly assigned men with more than one past renal stone of any type and soft drink consumption of at least 160 mL/day to reduced soft drink intake or no treatment. Although the intervention significantly reduced the risk for symptomatic recurrent stones (RR: 0.83; CI: 0.71-0.98), the level of evidence for this outcome is low because the results were from only one trial [565]. An analysis of 3 Channingâ€™s cohorts (194,095 participants) over a median follow-up of more than eight years has shown that consumption of sugar-sweetened soda and punch is associated with a higher risk of stone formation, whereas consumption of coffee, tea, beer, wine, and orange juice is associated with a lower risk [566], whereas consumption of tea and coffee does not seem to increase the risk of stones disease [567]. However, the intake of fluids should be considered within a holistic approach to health. Some of them contain calories or alcohol that may be detrimental to health. Therefore, water should be the preferred fluid. Diet A common-sense approach to diet should be taken, that is, a mixed, balanced diet with contributions from all food groups, without any excesses [557,568,569]. Sufficient calcium intake is needed especially in vegetarian and vegan diets [570]. Fruit, vegetables and fibre: Fruit and vegetable intake should be encouraged because of the beneficial effects of fiber, although the role of the latter in preventing stone recurrences is debatable [571-574]. The alkaline content of a vegetarian diet also increases urinary pH. In addition, fruits and vegetables have a high-water content and can significantly contribute to fluid intake. Oxalate: Excessive intake of oxalate-rich products should be limited or avoided to prevent high oxalate load [575], particularly in patients who have high oxalate excretion. Vitamin C: Although vitamin C is a precursor of oxalate, its role as a risk factor in calcium oxalate stone formation remains controversial [576]. However, it seems wise to advise calcium oxalate stone formers to avoid excessive intake. Animal protein: Animal protein should not be consumed in excess [577,578] and limited to 0.8-1.0 g/kg body weight. Excessive consumption of animal protein has several effects that favour stone formation, including hypocitraturia, low urine pH, hyperoxaluria, and hyperuricosuria. Calcium intake: Calcium should not be restricted, unless there are strong reasons for doing so, due to the inverse relationship between dietary calcium and stone formation [572,579]. The daily requirement for calcium is 1,000 to 1,200 mg [23]. Calcium supplements are not recommended except in enteric hyperoxaluria when additional calcium should be taken with meals to bind intestinal oxalate [557,575,577,580]. Older adults who do not have a history of renal stones but who take calcium supplements should ensure adequate fluid intake since it may prevent increases in urine calcium concentration, and thereby reduce or eliminate any increased risk of renal stones formation associated with calcium supplement use [581]. Sodium: Daily sodium (NaCl) intake should not exceed 4-5g [23]. High intake adversely affects urine composition: Calcium excretion is increased by reduced tubular re-absorption;urinary citrate is reduced due to loss of bicarbonate;increased risk of sodium urate crystal formation. Calcium stone formation can be reduced by restricting sodium and animal protein [577,578]. A positive correlation between sodium consumption and the risk of first-time stone formation has been confirmed only in women [579]. There have been no prospective clinical trials on the role of sodium restriction as an independent variable in reducing the risk of stone formation. Urate: Intake of purine-rich food should be restricted in patients with hyperuricosuric calcium oxalate [582,583] and uric acid stones. Intake should not exceed 500 mg/day [23]. 4.2.2. Lifestyle Lifestyle factors may influence the risk of stone formation, for example, those causing obesity [584], diabetes mellitus [585], and metabolic syndrome [586]. 4.2.3.
