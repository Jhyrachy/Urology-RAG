49-52% upper ureteral stones, 58-70% mid ureteral stones 68-83% distal ureteral stones. considering stone size almost 75% stones < 5 mm 62% stones ≥ 5 mm passed spontaneously, average time stone expulsion 17 days (range 6-29 days) . considering size location, stones <5 mm distal ureteral 89% chance spontaneous passage, 71% stones <5 mm located upper ureter still pass spontaneously . panel
