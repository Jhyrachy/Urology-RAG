3.16.4.1. extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy. many reports confirm swl performed children suspicion long-term morbidity kidney [1105-1112]. mean number shockwaves treatment approximately 1,800 2,000 (up 4,000 needed) mean power settings vary 14 kv 21 kv. recently, two separate rcts compared outcomes low vs. intermediate frequency swl found significant difference . use us digital fluoroscopy significantly decreased radiation exposure shown children exposed significantly lower doses radiation compared adults . concerns anaesthesia longer present problem due advances technique medication, even infant age group. type anaesthesia general dissociative children ten years age, whereas conventional intravenous sedation patient-controlled analgesia option older children able co-operate (le: 2b). general perception paediatric swl requiring anaesthesia challenged study showing swl without anaesthesia performed safely comparable success rates co-operative children > 9 years age . stone-free rates significantly affected various factors. regardless location, stone size increases, stone-free rates decrease retreatment rate increases. stone-free rates < 1 cm, 1-2 cm, > 2 cm overall, reported nearly 90%, 80%, 60% 80%, respectively. stone size increases, need additional sessions increases [1095,1115,1116,1119-1123]. previous history open surgery also decrease success swl . localisation calculi described significant factor affecting success rates different studies. stones renal pelvis upper ureter seem respond better swl. locations, stone clearance rates nearly 90%. however, swl found less effective caliceal stones; particularly lower caliceal stones. several studies reported stone-free rates isolated lower caliceal stones varying 50% 62% . shockwave lithotripsy also used treat ureteral calculi. however, specific issue controversial. success rates swl less distal ureteric stones. may also technical problems localisation focusing ureteric stones children [1123,1126-1128]. type machine used significantly influences success rates complications. first-generation machines deliver energy larger focal zone, resulting higher fragmentation rates single therapy. however, general anaesthesia usually required due intolerable discomfort associated first-generation machine. later-generation machines smaller focal zone deliver less energy, lower risk pulmonary trauma, however, additional treatments may needed. success rate higher younger children . although stenting affect stone clearance, overall complication rates higher hospital stay longer unstented patient larger stones . stenting essential solitary kidneys undergoing swl treatment. children large stone burden high risk developing steinstrasse urinary obstruction followed closely risk prolonged urinary tract obstruction swl. post-swl stent nephrostomy tube placement may needed prolonged obstruction . hounsfield unit (hu) stone non-contrast tomography also shown predictive factor success children swl found successful stones hu less 600 1,000 . two nomogram studies revealed male gender, younger age, smaller stone size, single stone, non-lower pole localisation negative history previous intervention favourable factors stone clearance paediatric swl . comparative study reported two nomograms independent predictors stone-free rate following swl paediatric patients . systematic review confirmed two nomograms equal value predicting outcomes swl children . although, invention miniaturised endoscopic instruments seems reduce importance popularity swl, advantage carrying risk certain complications related endoscopic surgeries also less post-operative emergency visits, pain anaesthetic sessions . complications arising swl children usually self-limiting transient. common are:: renal colic;transient hydronephrosis;dermal ecchymosis;uti;formation steinstrasse;sepsis;rarely, haemoptysis. children sterile pre-operative urine cultures, antibiotic prophylaxis decrease infectious complications recommended . however, every effort made sterilise urine performing swl, ureteroscopy (urs), percutaneous nephrolithotomy (pcnl).
