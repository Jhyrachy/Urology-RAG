3.3.5.2. Patients with ABU and recurrent UTI, otherwise healthy. One RCT investigated the effect of ABU treatment in female patients with recurrent symptomatic UTI without identified risk factors [24] and demonstrated that treatment of ABU increases the risk for a subsequent symptomatic UTI episode, compared to non-treated patients (RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.38; n=673). This protective effect of spontaneously developed ABU can be used as part of prevention in female patients with recurrent symptomatic UTI; therefore, treatment of ABU is not recommended.
