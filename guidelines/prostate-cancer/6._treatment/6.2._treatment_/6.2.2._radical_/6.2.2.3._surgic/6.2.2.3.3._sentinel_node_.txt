6.2.2.3.3. Sentinel node biopsy analysis. The rationale for a sentinel node biopsy (SNB) is based on the concept that a sentinel node is the first to be involved by migrating tumour cells. Therefore, when this node is negative it is possible to avoid an ePLND [542]. Intraprostatic injections of indocyanine green (ICG) have been used to visualise prostate-related LNs for SNB. In a randomised comparison, Harke et al., found more cancer-containing LNs in men who underwent a PLND guided by ICG but no difference in BCR at 22.9-month follow-up [543]. A SR of 21 studies showed a sensitivity of 95.2% and NPV of 98.0% for SNB in detecting men with metastases at ePLND [544]. However, this review was hampered by widespread heterogeneity of both definitions and how SNB is performed. This prompted the development of an expert consensus report to guide further research [542]. The prospective SENTINELLE study investigated the diagnostic accuracy of sentinel lymph node biopsy-guided lymph node dissection compared to extended pelvic LN dissection in patients with intermediate- or high-risk prostate cancer. Sensitivity, specificity, NPV, and positive predictive value of SNB method in detecting patients with at least one LN metastasis were 95.4% (95% CI, 75.1-99.7), 100% (95% CI, 96.6-100), 99.2% (95% CI, 95.5-99.9), and 100% (95% CI, 80.7-100), respectively [545].
