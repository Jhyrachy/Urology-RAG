4.3. Strictures in transgender men and woman. 4.3.1. Trans women After MtF gender confirming surgery, the penile urethra has been resected. Meatal strictures are defined as strictures occurring at the neomeatus, which is formed between the junction of the distal bulbar urethra and the neovagina. The other segments (bulbar and posterior) are the same as in a biological man. 4.3.2. Trans men Four different areas can be identified in the urethra after FtM gender confirming surgeries [147]: The native urethra is the female urethral segment which remains preserved during surgery. It goes from the bladder neck to the original external meatus.The fixed part (pars fixa) or perineal urethra follows the native urethra, starting at the original external meatus. This segment is reconstructed using local tissues, typically vestibular mucosa, or anterior vaginal mucosa. Its course is similar to the bulbar urethral segment in males, but without being covered by spongiosal tissue.The anastomotic part is the area where the pars fixa joins the neophallus.The phallic urethra is the segment located within the neophallus or the metoidioplasty and is usually made of skin tube. Its course is similar to the penile urethra in males, but without being covered by spongiosal tissue.
