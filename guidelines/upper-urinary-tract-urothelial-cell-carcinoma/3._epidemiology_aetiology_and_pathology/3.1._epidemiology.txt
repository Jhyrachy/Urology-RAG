3.1. Epidemiology. Urothelial carcinoma (UC) is the second most common urological malignancy in developed countries [7]. They can be localised in the lower (bladder and urethra) and/or the upper (pyelocaliceal cavities and ureter) urinary tract. Bladder cancer (BC) accounts for 90–95% of UCs whilst upper tract urothelial carcinomas (UTUC) account for only 5–10% of UCs with an estimated annual incidence in Western countries of almost two cases per 100,000 inhabitants [1]. This rate has risen in the past few decades likely as a result of improved detection and the aging population [8,9]. The peak incidence is in individuals aged 70–90 years and UTUC is twice as common in men [10]. A retrospective international registry including data from 2,380 patients diagnosed between 2014 and 2019 (101 centres from 29 countries) confirmed that UTUC patients were predominantly male (70.5%) and 53.3% were past or present smokers. The majority of patients (53%) were diagnosed after they presented with symptoms, mainly visible haematuria [11]. This was confirmed by a meta-analysis pooling 44 studies that showed a pooled UTUC incidence rate of 0.75% in patients with visible haematuria and 0.17% for those with non-visible haematuria [12]. In addition, approximately two-thirds of patients who present with UTUCs have muscle-invasive disease at diagnosis compared to 15–25% of patients diagnosed with de novo BC [13]. The higher incidence of muscle-invasive disease in UTUC vs. BC has been confirmed in population-based studies from Germany and England suggesting that muscle-invasive UTUC represents approximately half of incident cases in recent years [14,15]. Approximately 9% of patients present with metastasis [8,16-18]. Pyelocaliceal tumours are approximately twice as common as ureteral tumours and multifocal tumours are found in approximately 10–20% of cases [19]. The presence of concomitant carcinoma in situ of the upper tract is between 11% and 36% [8]. In 17% of cases, concurrent BC is present [20] whilst a prior history of BC is found in 41% of American men but in only 4% of Chinese men [21]. This, along with genetic and epigenetic factors, may explain why Asian patients present with more advanced and higher-grade disease compared to other ethnic groups [8]. Following treatment, recurrence in the bladder occurs in 29% of UTUC patients, depending on patient-, tumour- and treatment-specific characteristics [22] compared to a 2–5% recurrence rate in the contralateral upper tract [23].  Upper tract UC and BC exhibit significant differences in the prevalence of common genomic alterations. In individual patients with a history of both tumours, BC and UTUC are often clonally related. Genomic characterisation of UTUC provides information regarding the risk of bladder recurrence and can identify tumours associated with Lynch syndrome [24]. Regarding UTUC occurring in patients with BC, of 82 patients treated with intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) for high-risk BC who had regular upper tract imaging between years 1 and 3, 13% developed UTUC, all of which were asymptomatic [25], whilst in another series of 307 patients without routine upper tract imaging the incidence of UTUC after BC was 25% [26]. A multicentre cohort study (n = 402) with a 50 month follow-up demonstrated a UTUC incidence of 7.5% in NMIBC patients receiving BCG with predictors being intravesical recurrence and non-papillary tumour at transurethral resection of the bladder (TURB) [27]. Following radical cystectomy for MIBC, 3–5% of patients develop a metachronous UTUC [28,29].
