3.4.2. testosterone therapy outcomes. 3.4.2.1. sexual dysfunction sexual concerns main symptoms hypogonadal patients . consistent body evidence shows testosterone therapy hypogonadal men (total testosterone < 12 nmol/l) may beneficial effect several aspects sexual life; contrast, evidence benefits using testosterone therapy treating sexual dysfunction eugonadal men [69,85-87]. beneficial effect sexual function seems related testosterone level normalisation specific testosterone formulations used . meta-analysis placebo-controlled rcts showed testosterone therapy significantly improves erectile function (as measured iief-erectile function domain score) patients severe hypogonadism (i.e., total testosterone < 8 nmol/l) likely achieve better improvement patients milder hypogonadism (i.e., total testosterone < 12 nmol/l) . similar results observed sexual desire; however, presence metabolic comorbidity (such diabetes obesity) decreased magnitude improvements. particular, testosterone therapy alone resulted clinically effective outcome patients milder ed . similar results also confirmed update analysis recently published cochrane review . line data, report non-inferiority “testosterone replacement therapy assessment long-term vascular events efficacy response hypogonadal men (traverse)” study, showed middle-aged older hypogonadal (total testosterone < 10.4 nmol/l) men pre-existing high risk cvd, testosterone therapy gel two years improved sexual activity, hypogonadal symptoms, sexual desire, erectile function . sexual function parameters, intercourse, orgasm overall satisfaction, improved compared placebo . men comorbidity, t2dm, usually show modest improvements terms sexual function testosterone therapy may potentially require concomitant phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (pde5is) improve effectiveness . meta-analysis including 913 patients derived eight rcts suggested combination therapy (testosterone pde5is) superior compared pde5is alone improving erectile function . specific beneficial effect derived combined use testosterone therapy pde5is unclear . similarly, information related combined use testosterone therapy ed drug therapies lacking . sexual function trial testosterone trials (ttrials) (one largest placebo-controlled trials testosterone therapy) documented consistent improvements 10 12 measures sexual activities older (≥ 65 years) hypogonadal men, particularly frequency intercourse, masturbation nocturnal erections (as measured pdq-q4) . magnitude improvement shown proportional increase serum total testosterone, ft e2 levels, possible demonstrate threshold level . study 220 men mets without t2dm also found sexual function improved men reported sexual problems improvement iief scores, specific increases libido sexual satisfaction . 3.4.2.2. vitality physical strength role testosterone stimulating muscle growth strength well established. accordingly, androgenic-anabolic steroids (aas) used performance-enhancing agents increase physical performance competitive sport . regard, testosterone therapy hypogonadal men shown increase muscle mass reduce fat mass, limited effects final weight . despite evidence, role testosterone therapy older men mobility limitations remains unclear. national health nutrition examination survey 1999-2004 unable detect association overall circulating testosterone levels amount physical activity. however, among non-obese men, highest physical activity tertile significantly less likely low low-normal testosterone lowest tertile. data ttrials indicated testosterone therapy substantially increase fraction men whose six-minute walking distance increased > 50 absolute increase distance walked enrolled physical function trial . however, whole population ttrials considered, significant, although modest, positive effect two parameters reported . similar data derived vitality trial . support aforementioned considerations, recent meta-analysis including 2043 subjects older 60 years failed show significant improvement muscle strength testosterone therapy compared placebo . 3.4.2.3. mood cognition several observational studies documented relationship depressive symptoms, reduced qol hypogonadism . however, specific relationship hypogonadism incidence depression still unclear . placebo-controlled rcts investigated role testosterone therapy improving depressive symptoms. data derived ttrials showed testosterone therapy improved mood, depressive symptoms continuous measures using several instruments . however, final effect small magnitude. line data, largest meta-analysis available studies, including 1,890 hypogonadal men (baseline total testosterone < 12 nmol/l ft < 225 pmol/l) men 27 rcts, documented positive effect testosterone therapy particularly evident patients milder symptoms . blast study testosterone therapy t2dm reported men depression less likely respond regards symptoms sexual dysfunction compared men without depression . robust data effect testosterone therapy qol limited. although recent meta-analyses suggest significant effect testosterone therapy placebo, magnitude low heterogeneity high, therefore reducing scientific value effect . role testosterone therapy patients cognitive impairment even uncertain. ttrials evaluated effect testosterone therapy 493 individuals age-associated memory impairment assess possible improvement several aspects cognitive function. however, results failed demonstrate beneficial effect testosterone therapy improving cognitive function . similarly, meta-analysis involving 17 studies enrolling 1,438 patients mean age 70.4 years mean follow-up 45.6 weeks find effect testosterone therapy cognitive domains . 3.4.2.4. body composition metabolic profile late onset hypogonadism associated greater percentage fat mass lesser lean mass compared testosterone-repleted men . major effect low testosterone increase visceral adiposity also leads deposition lipids liver muscle associated atherosclerosis . published data suggested testosterone therapy reduces percentage body fat increases lean mass . testosterone therapy also found decrease waist circumference, body weight bmi, effects predominant twelve months treatment [104-106]. two years, t4dm rct reported men testosterone therapy lifestyle programme greater reduction waist circumference, total abdominal fat mass increase total arm muscle mass increased strength non-dominant hand compared lifestyle programme alone . trend toward reduction body weight although approached significance reach significance. latter result probably compounded increase muscle mass well decrease fat mass. however, recognised results previous studies mainly derived registry observational trials, important limitations due risk selection bias non-random assignment testosterone exposure. accordingly, data derived rcts showed improvement fat mass lean mass amount without modifications body weight . meta-analysis including seventeen rcts specifically investigated role testosterone therapy several metabolic parameters patients t2dm and/or mets . line reported general population, testosterone therapy associated improvement body composition either t2dm mets without effects body weight. similarly positive effects also observed fasting glycemia insulin resistance (homa index) whilst conflicting data obtained hba1c lipid profile . 3.4.2.5. bone evidence suggests bone mineralisation requires circulating sex steroids within normal range . possible association mild hypogonadism osteopenia/osteoporosis weak, whereas severe hypogonadism (total testosterone < 3.5 nm) frequently associated bone loss osteoporosis, independent patient age . three independent meta-analyses showed positive effect testosterone therapy bone mineral density (bmd), highest effect lumber level [108-110]. interestingly, latter meta-analysis provided novel evidence role testosterone bmd even higher patients diabetes , higher risk hypogonadism bone fracture . similarly, data derived ttrials t4dm studies confirmed testosterone therapy increased bmd hypogonadal ageing men . however, available data insufficient determine effect testosterone therapy alone risk fractures . recent data aforementioned traverse trial quite surprisingly showed increased incidence overall bone fractures among men received testosterone therapy compared received placebo . however, recognized difference major osteoporotic fractures (i.e., hip, wrist, humerus, clinical spine hip) observed groups. moreover, observation derived patient reports therefore deserves specifically adjudicated. conclusion, recognized use testosterone therapy adjunct anti-resorptive treatment hypogonadal patients high risk fractures established. therefore, anti-resorptive therapy must first-choice treatment hypogonadal men high risk bone fractures. combination anti-resorptive treatment testosterone therapy offered conjunction hypogonadism-related symptoms. 3.4.2.6. summary evidence recommendations testosterone therapy outcome summary evidenceletestosterone therapy improve:milder forms ed libido
