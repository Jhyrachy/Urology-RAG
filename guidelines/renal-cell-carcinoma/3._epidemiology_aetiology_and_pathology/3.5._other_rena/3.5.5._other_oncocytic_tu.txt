3.5.5. Other oncocytic tumours of the kidney. Other oncocytic tumours of the kidney are a heterogeneous group of oncocytic tumours not classifiable as oncocytoma, chRCC, or other tumour types with eosinophilic features. These tumours are typically indolent, so it is important to distinguish such low-grade tumours from the high-grade unclassified RCCs that typically behave aggressively. In the setting of Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome (see Section 3.5.6), tumours with such intermediate features (hybrid oncocytic tumours) also exist, typically being multifocal and bilateral. As this is a heterogeneous tumour group, it is likely that new subtypes of renal neoplasia will emerge. There are already two emerging entities: eosinophilic vacuolated tumour (EVT) and low-grade oncocytic tumour (LOT) [22].
