4.7. Renal function measurement. Renal function may be assessed by serum creatinine or estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Hydronephrosis, renal insufficiency or urinary retention are more prevalent in patients with signs or symptoms of BPO [70]. Even though BPO may be responsible for these complications, there is no conclusive evidence on the mechanism [71]. One study reported that 11% of men with LUTS had renal insufficiency [70]. Neither symptom score nor QoL was associated with the serum creatinine level. Diabetes mellitus or hypertension were the most likely causes of the elevated creatinine concentration. Comiter et al., [72] reported that non-neurogenic voiding dysfunction is not a risk factor for elevated creatinine levels. Koch et al., [73] concluded that only those with an elevated creatinine level or reduced eGFR require investigational ultrasound (US) of the kidney and bladder to assess post-void residual. In the Olmsted County Study, there was a cross-sectional association between signs and symptoms of BPO (though not prostate volume) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) [74]. In 2,741 consecutive patients who presented with LUTS, decreased Qmax, a history of hypertension and/or diabetes were associated with CKD [75]. Another study demonstrated a correlation between Qmax and eGFR in middle-aged men with moderate-to-severe LUTS [76]. Patients with renal insufficiency are at an increased risk of developing post-operative complications [77]. Summary of evidenceLEDecreased Qmax and a history of hypertension and/or diabetes are associated with CKD in patients who present with LUTS.3Patients with renal insufficiency are at an increased risk of developing post-operative complications.3 RecommendationStrength ratingAssess renal function if renal impairment is suspected based on history and clinical examination, or in the presence of hydronephrosis, or when considering surgical treatment for male LUTS.Strong
