3.1.10.8. Belatacept. Belatacept is a fusion protein, which effectively blocks the CD28 co-stimulatory pathway and thereby prevents T-cell activation [279,347-350]. Belatacept is intravenously administered and indicated for use as part of a CNI-free regimen together with basiliximab induction, mycophenolate, and corticosteroids. Long-term data from three randomised studies of de novo kidney transplant recipients demonstrated better renal function versus cyclosporine-based immunosuppression, although rates and grades of acute rejection were higher for belatacept in the first year post-transplant [243,246,259,279,349-355]. In patients receiving a standard deceased or living donor kidney, better graft survival was observed, while similar graft survival rates were found with ECDs. Interestingly, belatacept-treated patients had better preserved histology and developed less donor specific antibodies (DSA) compared to cyclosporine [356]. The long-term safety profile of belatacept treated patients was similar to cyclosporine controls, less belatacept treated patients developed metabolic complications or discontinued treatment due to adverse events [347,348]. In addition, the option of converting patients (either stable patients or due to CNI or m-TOR associated toxicity) was explored with promising initial results [347,348,352,357-359]. Specific safety signals include a higher rate of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (especially in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) negative patients), more herpes infections, and tuberculosis in patients from endemic areas [279,347-350]. Belatacept was approved in the U.S. and in Europe for EBV positive patients, but is not yet available in many countries. Additional studies are ongoing to fully explore the value of this compound.
