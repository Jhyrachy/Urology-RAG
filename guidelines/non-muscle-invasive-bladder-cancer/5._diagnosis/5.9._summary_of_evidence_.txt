5.9. Summary of evidence and recommendations for the primary assessment of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. Summary of evidenceLECystoscopy is necessary for the diagnosis of BC.1Urinary cytology has high sensitivity in high-grade tumours including carcinoma in situ.2b RecommendationsStrength ratingTake a patient history, focusing on urinary tract symptoms and haematuria.StrongUse renal and bladder ultrasound and/or computed tomography-intravenous urography (CT-IVU) during the initial work-up in patients with haematuria.StrongOnce a bladder tumour has been detected, perform a CT urography in selected cases (e.g., tumours located in the trigone, multiple- or high-risk tumours).StrongPerform cystoscopy in patients with symptoms suggestive of bladder cancer or during surveillance. It cannot be replaced by cytology or by any other non-invasive test.StrongIn men, use a flexible cystoscope, if available, and apply irrigation ‘bag squeeze’ to decrease procedural pain when passing the proximal urethra.StrongDescribe all macroscopic features of the tumour (site, size, number, and appearance) and mucosal abnormalities during cystoscopy. Use a bladder diagram (Figure 5.1).StrongUse voided urine cytology as an adjunct to cystoscopy to detect high-grade tumour.StrongPerform cytology on at least 25 mL fresh urine or urine with adequate fixation. First morning urine is not suitable because of the frequent presence of cytolysis.StrongUse the Paris System 2nd Edn. for cytology reporting.Strong
