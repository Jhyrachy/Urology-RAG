6.7.8.4. Sequencing treatment. 6.7.8.4.1. ARPI -> ARPI (chemotherapy-naïve mCRPC patients) The use of sequential ARPIs in mCRPC showed limited benefit in retrospective series as well as in one prospective trial [1245-1252]. In particular in patients who had a short response to the first ARPI for mCRPC (< twelve months), this sequence should be avoided because of known cross resistance and the availability of chemotherapy and PARP inhibitors (if a relevant mutation is present). In highly selected patients treated for more than 24 weeks with AAP, the sequence with enzalutamide showed some activity with a median rPFS of 8.1 months (95% CI: 6.1–8.3) and an unconfirmed PSA response rate of 27% [1253]. In case the patient is unfit for chemotherapy and a PARP inhibitor, best supportive care should be considered in case no other appropriate treatment option is available (clinical trial or immunotherapy if MSI-high). An ARPI-ARPI sequence should never be the preferred option but might be considered in such patients if the PS still allows for active treatment and the potential side effects seem manageable. First prospective cross-over data on an ARPI-ARPI sequence [1245] and a SR and meta-analysis suggest that for the endpoints PFS and PSA PFS, but not for OS, abiraterone followed by enzalutamide is the preferred choice [1254]. 6.7.8.4.2. ARPI -> PARP inhibitor This sequence in patients with deleterious or suspected deleterious germline or somatic HRR gene-mutated mCRPC is supported by data from the randomised phase III PROfound trial studying olaparib [1162] and TRITON 3 studying rucaparib [1219]. A subgroup of patients in pROfound was pre-treated with one or two ARPIs and no chemotherapy (35%). The ARPI-PARP inhibitor sequence versus ARPI-ARPI or ARPI-docetaxel in patients with BRCA 1/ 2 (and ATM) altered tumours was studied in TRITON-3 and showed a significant rPFS benefit in favour of the PARP inhibitor following the first ARPI. These data underscore the importance of early genomic testing in mCRPC patients. (see also chapter 6.7.7.5) 6.7.8.4.3. Docetaxel for mHSPC -> docetaxel rechallenge There is limited evidence for second- or third-line use of docetaxel after treatment with docetaxel for mHSPC. Docetaxel seems to be less active than ARPI at progression to mCRPC following docetaxel for mHSPC [1255]. 6.7.8.4.4. ARPI -> docetaxel or docetaxel -> ARPI followed by PARP inhibitor Both olaparib and rucaparib are active in biomarker-selected mCRPC patients after ARPI and docetaxel in either sequence [1162,1241]. 6.7.8.4.5. ARPI before or after docetaxel There is level 1 evidence for both sequences (see Table 6.7.3). 6.7.8.4.6. ARPI –> docetaxel -> cabazitaxel or docetaxel –> ARPI -> cabazitaxel Both third-line treatment sequences are supported by level 1 evidence. Of note, there is high-level evidence favouring cabazitaxel vs. a second ARPI after docetaxel and one ARPI in particular in patients progressing ≤ twelve months on a prior ARPI. CARD is the first prospective randomised phase III trial addressing this question (see Table 6.7.3) [1164].
