7.6. Adjuvant therapy. 7.6.1. Role of adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy Adjuvant chemotherapy after RC for patients with pT3/4 and/or LN positive (N+) disease without clinically detectable metastases (M0) is still under debate. The general benefits of adjuvant chemotherapy include: chemotherapy is administered after accurate pathological staging, therefore, treatment in patients at low risk for micrometastases is avoided;no delay in definitive surgical treatment. The drawbacks of adjuvant chemotherapy are: assessment of in vivo chemosensitivity of the tumour is not possible and overtreatment is an unavoidable problem;delay of or intolerability to chemotherapy, due to post-operative morbidity [463]. There is limited evidence from adequately conducted and accrued phase III RCTs in favour of the routine use of adjuvant chemotherapy [464-469]. An individual patient data meta-analysis [470] of survival data from six RCTs of adjuvant chemotherapy [471-473] included 491 patients (unpublished data from Otto et al., were included in the analysis). All included trials suffered from significant methodological flaws including small sample size (underpowered), incomplete accrual, use of inadequate statistical methods and design flaws (irrelevant endpoints and failing to address salvage chemotherapy in case of relapse or metastases) [464]. In these trials, three or four cycles of CMV, cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, and adriamycin (CISCA), methotrexate, vinblastine, adriamycin or epirubicin, and cisplatin (MVA(E)C) and cisplatin with methotrexate (CM) were used [474], and one trial used cisplatin monotherapy [475]. The data were not convincing to support an unequivocal recommendation for the use of adjuvant chemotherapy. In 2014, this meta-analysis was updated with an additional three studies [467-469] resulting in the inclusion of 945 patients from nine trials [466]. None of the trials had fully accrued and individual patient data were not used in the analysis [466]. For one trial only an abstract was available at the time of the meta-analysis [468] and none of the included individual trials were significantly positive for OS in favour of adjuvant chemotherapy. In two of the trials more modern chemotherapy regimens were used (gemcitabine/cisplatin and paclitaxel/gemcitabine/cisplatin) [467,468]. The HR for OS was 0.77 (95% CI: 0.59–0.99, p = 0.049) and for DFS 0.66 (95% CI: 0.45–0.91, p = 0.014) with a stronger impact on DFS in case of nodal positivity. Recently, a systematic review and meta-analysis of individual patient data from RCTs in patients treated with adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy for MIBC was conducted [476]. In an analysis of 10 RCTs (n = 1,183), an OS benefit was demonstrated for cisplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy (HR: 0.82, 95% CI: 0.70–0.96, p = 0.02). This translates into an absolute improvement in survival of 6% at 5 years, from 50% to 56%, and a 9% absolute benefit when adjusted for age, sex, pT stage, and pN category (HR: 0.77, 95% CI: 0.65–0.92, p = 0.004). Adjuvant chemotherapy was also shown to improve RFS (HR: 0.71, 95% CI: 0.60-0.83, p < 0.001), locoregional RFS (HR: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.55–0.85, p < 0.001), and MFS (HR: 0.79, 95% CI: 0.65–0.95, p = 0.01), with absolute benefits of 11%, 11%, and 8%, respectively. A retrospective cohort analysis including 3,974 patients after cystectomy and LND showed an OS benefit in high-risk subgroups (extravesical extension and nodal involvement) (HR: 0.75, CI: 0.62–0.90) [477]. A publication of the largest RCT (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer [EORTC] 30994), although not fully accrued, showed a significant improvement of PFS for immediate, compared with deferred, cisplatin-based chemotherapy (HR: 0.54, 95% CI: 0.4–0.73, p < 0.0001), but there was no significant OS benefit [478]. Furthermore, a large observational study including 5,653 patients with pathological T3–4 and/ or pathological node-positive BC, treated between 2003 and 2006 compared the effectiveness of adjuvant chemotherapy vs. observation. Twenty-three percent of patients received adjuvant chemotherapy with a 5-year OS of 37% for the adjuvant arm vs. 29.1% (HR: 0.70, 95% CI: 0.64–0.76) in the observation group [479]. Another large retrospective analysis based on the U.S. National Cancer Database including 15,397 patients with locally-advanced (pT3/4) or LN-positive disease also demonstrated an OS benefit in patients with UC histology [480]. In patients with concomitant histological subtypes, however, no benefit was found. Patients should be informed about potential chemotherapy options before RC and the limited evidence for adjuvant chemotherapy. 7.6.2. Role of adjuvant immunotherapy To determine the benefit of PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors, three phase III RCTs have evaluated checkpoint inhibitor monotherapy with atezolizumab, nivolumab or pembrolizumab in patients with muscle-invasive UC. The CheckMate 274 phase III multi-centre, double-blind, RCT of adjuvant nivolumab vs. placebo for up to 1 year in 709 patients with muscle-invasive UC with a high risk of recurrence (pathological stage pT3, pT4a, or pN+) (neoadjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy was allowed before trial entry) demonstrated a significant improvement in median DFS (20.8 months [95% CI: 16.5–27.6] with nivolumab and 10.8 months [95% CI: 8.3–13.9] with placebo). The percentage of patients who were alive and disease-free at 6 months was 74.9% with nivolumab and 60.3% with placebo (HR for disease recurrence or death, 0.70; 98.22% CI: 0.55–0.90; p < 0.001). Among patients with a PD-L1 expression level of ≥ 1% (tumor cell [TC] score), the percentage of patients was 74.5% and 55.7%, respectively (HR: 0.55; 98.72% CI: 0.35–0.85; p < 0.001) [481]. In an analysis using both PD-L1 TC score and combined positive score (CPS), more patients had CPS ≥ 1 than TC ≥ 1% and patients with CPS ≥ 1 had improved DFS with nivolumab which may have contributed to the benefit seen with adjuvant nivolumab in patients with TC < 1% and CPS ≥ 1 [482]. There was no clinically meaningful deterioration in health-related quality of life with adjuvant nivolumab compared to placebo [483]. The primary endpoint of DFS was not achieved in a multi-centre RCT of adjuvant atezolizumab vs. observation in patients with ypT2–4a or ypN+ tumours following NAC or pT3–4a or pN+ tumours if no NAC was received (IMvigor010). Median DFS was 19.4 months (95% CI: 15.9–24.8) with atezolizumab and 16.6 months (11.2–24.8) with observation (stratified HR: 0.89, 95% CI: 0.74–1.08, p = 0.24) [484]. A similarly designed trial of pembrolizumab in the adjuvant setting has completed accrual with results awaited. The FDA has approved nivolumab for adjuvant treatment of patients with UC who are at high risk of recurrence after undergoing surgery [485] whereas the EMA has approved adjuvant nivolumab for the treatment of adults with muscle-invasive UC (MIUC) with tumour cell PD-L1 expression ≥ 1%, who are at high risk of recurrence after undergoing radical resection of MIUC. A promising report (see Marker section) has suggested a potential role for ctDNA to guide the use of adjuvant IO for UC [486]. 7.6.3. Summary of evidence and guidelines for adjuvant therapy Summary of evidenceLEAdjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy for high-risk patients (pT3, 4 and/or or N+ M0) without neoadjuvant treatment can be associated with improvement in DFS and OS but trials are underpowered to adequately answer this question.2aTo date, studies of immune checkpoint inhibitors in the adjuvant setting in patients with high-risk MIBC who have or have not received NAC have demonstrated conflicting results with the CheckMate 274 study demonstrating an improvement in DFS with adjuvant nivolumab and the IMvigor 010 study failing to show an improvement in DFS with adjuvant atezolizumab.1bCirculating tumour DNA holds promise as both a prognostic and predictive biomarker to guide the use of adjuvant IO for UC in patients who are at a high risk of recurrence and positive for ctDNA treated with adjuvant atezolizumab demonstrating improved outcomes compared with observation.2b RecommendationsStrength ratingOffer adjuvant cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy to patients with pT3/4 and/or pN+ disease if no neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been given.StrongOffer adjuvant nivolumab to selected patients with pT3/4 and/or pN+ disease not eligible for, or who declined, adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy.Weak
