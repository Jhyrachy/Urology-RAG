3.2. Aetiology. For male primary urethral carcinoma, various predisposing factors have been reported, including urethral strictures [11,12], chronic irritation after intermittent catheterisation/urethroplasty [13-15], external beam irradiation therapy (EBRT) [16], radioactive seed implantation [17], chronic urethral inflammation/urethritis following sexually transmitted diseases (i.e., condylomata associated with human papilloma virus 16) [18,19] and lichen sclerosis [12]. In female urethral carcinoma, urethral diverticula [20-22] and recurrent urinary tract infections [23] have been associated with primary urethral carcinoma. Mid-urethral sling meshes have not been associated with an increased risk of primary urethral carcinoma [24]. Clear-cell adenocarcinoma (AC) may also have a congenital origin [25,26].
