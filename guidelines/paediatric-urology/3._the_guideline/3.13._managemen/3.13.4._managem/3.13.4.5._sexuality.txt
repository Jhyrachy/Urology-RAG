3.13.4.5. Sexuality. Sexuality, while not an issue in childhood, becomes progressively more important as the patient gets older. This issue has historically been overlooked in individuals with myelodysplasia. However, patients with myelodysplasia do have sexual encounters [807]. The prevalence of precocious puberty is higher in girls with meningomyelocele [808]. Studies indicate that at least 15-20% of males are capable of fathering children and 70% of females can conceive and carry a pregnancy to term. It is therefore important to counsel patients about sexual development in early adolescence. Women seem to be more sexually active than men in some studies from the Netherlands and the USA [807,809]. The level of the lesion was the main predictor to be sexually active [810,811]. Erectile function can be improved by sildenafil in up to 80% of the male patients [812,813] . Neurosurgical anastomosis between the inguinal nerve and the dorsal penile nerve in patients with a lesion below L3 and disturbed sensation is still to be considered as an experimental treatment [809,814]. Only 17% to one third of the patients talk to their doctors about sexuality, 25â€“68% were informed by their doctors about reproductive function [807]. Continence seems to play an important role too. Nine out eleven females without sexual dysfunction reported continence, whereas 50 out of 59 with sexual dysfunction have some urinary incontinence in a recent study [815]. Therefore, early discussion about sexuality in the adolescent is recommended and should be promoted by the paediatric urologist taking care of these patients.
