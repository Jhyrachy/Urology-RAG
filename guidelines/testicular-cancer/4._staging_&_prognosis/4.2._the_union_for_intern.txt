4.2. The Union for International Cancer Control prognostic groups. According to the 2016 TNM classification, the following prognostic groups are defined: Table 2: Prognostic groups for testicular cancer (UICC, 2016, 8th edn.)Â [28] Stage groupingTNMSStage 0pTisN0M0S0Stage IpT1-T4N0M0SXStage IApT1N0M0S0Stage IBpT2 - pT4N0M0S0Stage ISAny pT/TXN0M0S1-3Stage IIAny pT/TXN1-N3M0SXStage IIAAny pT/TXN1M0S0Any pT/TXN1M0S1Stage IIBAny pT/TXN2M0S0Any pT/TXN2M0S1Stage IICAny pT/TXN3M0S0Any pT/TXN3M0S1Stage IIIAny pT/TXAny NM1aSXStage IIIAAny pT/TXAny NM1aS0Any pT/TXAny NM1aS1Stage IIIBAny pT/TXN1-N3M0S2Any pT/TXAny NM1aS2Stage IIICAny pT/TXN1-N3M0S3Any pT/TXAny NM1aS3Any pT/TXAny NM1bAny S Prognostic groups for testicular cancerStage IA:Primary tumours limited to the testis and epididymis, with no evidence of microscopic vascular or lymphatic invasion by tumour cells on microscopy, no sign of metastases on clinical examination or imaging, and post-orchidectomy serum tumour marker levels within normal limits. Marker decline in patients with Clinical Stage I (CS I) disease should be assessed until normalisation occurs on two consecutive measurements.Stage IB:More locally invasive primary tumour, but no sign of metastatic disease.Stage IS:Following orchiectomy tumour markers increase, remain persistently elevated or fail to decline as expected by half-lives indicating the presence of subclinical metastatic disease. The presence of a second GCT in the contralateral testis should also be excluded. In population-based patient series from developed countries, 75-80% of SGCT patients, and 55-64% of NSGCT patients had CS I disease at diagnosis [30,31]. True CS I, i.e. persistently elevated or increasing serum tumour marker levels after radical orchidectomy, was found in approximately 5% of NSGCT patients [30].
