6.3.5.2. Post-traumatic posterior stenosis. The acute and early management of PFUIs is discussed in the EAU Guidelines on Urological Trauma. A nonobliterative stenosis is the result of a partial injury at the membranous urethra or occurs after unsuccessful early realignment of a partial or complete injury. An obliterative stenosis is the consequence of a complete injury with a distraction defect between the ruptured urethral ends. The gap between these ends fills up with dense fibrotic tissue [11]. The deferred management of PFUI is at earliest three months after the trauma. After that period, the pelvic haematoma has nearly always resolved, the prostate has descended into a more normal position, the scar tissue has stabilised [430] and the patient is clinically stable and able to lie down in the lithotomy position [430]. 6.3.5.2.1. Endoluminal treatment for post-traumatic posterior stenosis 6.3.5.2.1.1. Endoluminal treatment as primary treatment for post-traumatic posterior stenosis Endoluminal treatment (dilation, DVIU) of an obliterative stenosis using the cut-to-the light principle will not be successful [46] and has a risk of creating a false passage towards the bladder base or rectum [431]. For a non-obliterative, short (< 1.5 cm) stenosis, one attempt of endoluminal treatment (endoscopic incision or dilation) can be performed. Kulkarni et al., reported a 92.3% and 96.5% stricture-free rate with “cold knife” and holmium laser urethrotomy, respectively (median follow-up respectively 61 and 57 months) [432]. These results are challenged by Barbagli et al., who reported a 51% stricture-free rate with holmium laser urethrotomy but with no data on length of follow-up available [433]. Cai et al., compared patient outcomes between bipolar plasma vaporisation and “cold knife” DVIU in 53 patients with posterior traumatic (80%) and iatrogenic (20%) urethral strictures with significantly different stricture-free rates of 81.5% vs. 53.8% at a mean follow-up of 13.9 months, respectively [434]. No severe complications were reported in either group. A statistically significant shorter operative time was found in the bipolar group [434]. Barratt et al,. calculated a composite stricturefree rate of 20% after all types of endoscopic treatments (but with a mix of obliterative and non-obliterative stenoses) [46]. De novo UI was reported in 4% of cases [46]. Repetitive endoluminal treatments are unlikely to be curative and must be discouraged as this delays the time to definitive cure and can lead to more complications [435,436]. 6.3.5.2.1.2. Endoluminal treatment after failed urethroplasty for post-traumatic posterior stenosis In case of a non-obliterative and short (< 1 cm) recurrence after failed urethroplasty, endoluminal treatment can be performed [437]. Although a 1st and 2nd DVIU can be successful with a stricture-free rate of 22.9-77.3% and 0-60% respectively, three or more incisions are never successful (see supplementary Table S6.16) [437-440]. Therefore, repetitive endoluminal treatments (dilations and/or endoscopic incisions) can only be considered as a palliative option [441]. Summary of evidenceLEEndoluminal treatment of obliterative stenoses is not successful and may create false passages towards bladder or rectum.3A 1st DVIU has stricture-free rates of 22.9-77.3% for a short and non-obliterative recurrence after excision and primary anastomosis.3Three or more endoscopic incisions are never successful for recurrence after excision and primary anastomosis.3 RecommendationsStrength ratingDo not perform endoscopic treatment for an obliterative stenosis.StrongPerform one attempt at endoluminal treatment for a short, non-obliterative stenosis.WeakDo not perform more than two direct vision internal urethrotomies and/or dilatations for a short and non-obliterative recurrence after excision and primary anastomosis for a traumatic posterior stenosis if long-term urethral patency is the desired intent.Weak 6.3.5.2.2. Urethroplasty for post-traumatic posterior stenosis In view of the complexity and difficulty of urethroplasty and the fact that the best results are obtained with its first attempt, this surgery must be performed in high-volume centres [442]. It has been calculated that to achieve and maintain sufficient experience in the reconstruction of PFUI, one centre per twelve million inhabitants is sufficient (for well-resourced countries) [443]. 6.3.5.2.2.1. First urethroplasty for post-traumatic posterior stenosis 6.3.5.2.2.1.1.Indication and technique of urethroplasty for post-traumatic posterior stenosis Progressive perineal EPA is the standard treatment for an obliterative stenosis and for a non-obliterative stenosis as first attempt, or after failure of primary endoluminal treatment [46,444]. Although both a midline and inverted U-incision are possible to gain access to the posterior urethra, a midline incision is associated with a significant reduction in trauma to the superficial perineal and posterior scrotal nerves and vessels, in the rate of surgical site infections (3.1% vs. 16.4%) and reduced length of hospitalisation [369]. A combined transpubic abdomino-perineal approach is only necessary in complicated cases such as those with associated para-urethral bladder base fistula, trauma-related recto-urethral fistula, and bladder neck injury [431]. Total pubectomy during transpubic abdomino-perineal reconstruction has a higher complication rate (bleeding, pelvic instability, dead space) compared to partial (superior or inferior) pubectomy with no gain in surgical exposure [445]. Although also considered complex situations, iatrogenic recto-urethral fistula (after misdirected endoscopic treatment), traumatic recto-urethral fistula < 5 cm from the anus, UCF and urinoma cavity can usually be corrected by a progressive perineal approach only [431,446]. 6.3.5.2.2.1.2.Patency rate after urethroplasty for post-traumatic posterior stenosis The overall patency rate after deferred EPA is 85.7% [46]. Complete excision of scar tissue is a strong predictor for freedom of stricture whereas number (3-5 vs. 6-7) and size (3.0 vs. 4.0) of sutures are not [447]. A retrospective study showed an improved patency rate after eversion of the urethral mucosa of both urethral ends before anastomosis (“valgus urethral mucosa anastomosis”) [448], but this finding has yet to be confirmed in a prospective fashion. To preserve the antegrade arterial inflow of the bulbar urethra and reduce the surgical trauma of “classic” deferred EPA, bulbar artery sparing EPA has been described [449]. Initial patency rates vary between 88.5-100% with 20-45 months of follow-up (see supplementary Table S6.17) [449-451]. Xie et al., only used this technique for distraction defects less than 2.5 cm [451]. No evidence exists to date whether bulbar artery sparing EPA is superior to the “classic” EPA in terms of patency rate and potency and continence rates. In case of a very deep location of the proximal urethral end that makes anastomotic suturing impossible, Badenoch described a pull-through technique which has a 33.3-96.5% patency rate after 43-126 months of follow-up (see supplementary Table S6.18 for further information) [432,452,453]. With the aim to reduce stricture recurrence, Wong et al., advise a 1.5 cm segment overlap of the bulbar stump within the prostatic urethra during the pull-through technique [452]. To facilitate the suturing at the proximal part of the urethra located deep under the pubic bone, the robotic approach is under exploration but there is no evidence so far of improved outcome with this approach [454]. 6.3.5.2.2.1.3.Sexual function, urinary continence, and rectal injury after urethroplasty for post-traumatic posterior stenosis Regarding erectile function, a prospective study by Hosseini et al., found no significant difference before, and three or six months after EPA for posterior traumatic stenosis [455]. Another prospective study by Tang et al., also demonstrated no significant overall change in ED after urethroplasty. However, in the subgroup of patients with pre-operative non-vascular ED, a significant post-operative increase in ED was observed [456]. A meta-analysis of retrospective studies showed a significant decline of the rate of ED from 43.27% before to 24.01% after posterior urethroplasty (p < 0.001) [457]. Assessment of erectile function and its definitive treatment (e.g., penile prosthesis) should be performed two years after the trauma because of the potential return of normal erectile function within that time [458,459]. After deferred EPA, antegrade ejaculation is present in 98.3-100% of cases [460,461]. Decreased ejaculatory volume and/or diminished ejaculatory force were reported in 17.2-18.7% of cases but it cannot be assessed whether this is due to the trauma or due to the surgery [460,461]. Continence after PFUI and urethroplasty is generally attributed to a competent bladder neck [46]. On the other hand, as most ruptures occur at the bulbomembranous junction just below the external sphincteric mechanism, at least a part of the external sphincter mechanism can be spared during urethroplasty [462]. Therefore, incontinence is rare with deferred EPA (6.8-8.5%) and is usually due to incompetence of the bladder neck although an incompetent bladder neck will not necessarily result in incontinence after urethroplasty [46,462,463]. Rectal injury is a relatively rare (0-10.2%) but severe complication after deferred EPA (see supplementary Table S6.19) [430,438,445,463-467]. The risk of rectal injury tends to be higher in complicated cases or cases with previous urethral manipulations [430,468,469]. 6.3.5.2.2.2. ReDo-urethroplasty for post-traumatic posterior stenosis In case of a recurrent stenosis, a repeat (“ReDo”) urethroplasty is possible. In the majority of cases, especially if not all consecutive length-gaining manoeuvres have been used during the 1st EPA, another EPA can be performed [463,467,468,470-472]. The Badenoch pull-through technique is again an option if no adequate mucosa-to-mucosa suturing is possible (See supplementary Table S6.18) [452,453]. In case of excessive dead space after resection of the fibrosis, gracilis muscle [469] or omental flaps (laparoscopically harvested if urethroplasty was performed using perineal approach only) [431,465] have been advised to fill up this space and support the anastomosis. These flaps, or alternatively bulbospongious muscle or local subcutaneous dartos flaps, are also useful to separate the suture lines in case of a concomitant recto-urethral fistula [431,442,446,469]. If the urethra cannot be anastomosed in a tension-free fashion, despite the aforementioned manoeuvres, or in cases of ischemic narrowing/necrosis of the bulbar urethra, options are a tubed preputial island flap, staged BMG urethroplasty with flap, staged buccal mucosa dartos flap, radial forearm free flap urethroplasty or entero-urethroplasty [442,467,471,473]. In case of entero-urethroplasty, the sigmoid colon is preferred above ileum (which is in turn better than stomach) because of the proximity of the vascular pedicle to the perineum. Entero-urethroplasty should only be done in the presence of a competent bladder neck because subsequent implantation of an AUS is nearly impossible [473]. Patency rate of different types of ReDo-urethroplasty varies between 50-100% (Table 6.11) [442,463,467,468,471,473]. An alternative is to abandon the normal urinary outlet and opt for Mitrofanoff-vesicostomy, PU (if local perineoscrotal skin is suitable) or permanent suprapubic diversion [467,473].
