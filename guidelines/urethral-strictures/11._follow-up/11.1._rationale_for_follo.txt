11.1. Rationale for follow-up after urethral surgery. The rationale for following-up patients after urethral stricture surgery is to detect and manage any complication or recurrence. As with any surgical procedure, following urethroplasty some patients will present with complications at short to medium follow-up: up to 34-38% of all anterior urethroplasties. Most of these complications (92-99.1%) would be classified as Clavien grade 1 or 2 [558,559]. Even though urethroplasty techniques provide the highest chances for successful treatment of urethral strictures, some patients will experience recurrence [346]. For further details on particular outcomes in each urethral segment, please review the individual chapters of this Guideline. Summary of evidenceLEAfter urethroplasty surgery, recurrent strictures appear with different frequency depending on stricture features and urethroplasty techniques.3 RecommendationStrength ratingOffer follow-up to all patients after urethroplasty surgery.Strong
