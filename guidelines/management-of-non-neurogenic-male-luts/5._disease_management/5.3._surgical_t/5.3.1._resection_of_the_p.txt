5.3.1. Resection of the prostate. 5.3.1.1. Monopolar and bipolar transurethral resection of the prostate Mechanism of action: Transurethral resection of the prostate is either performed in a M-TURP or bipolar TURP (B-TURP) fashion. Transurethral resection of the prostate removes tissue from the transition zone of the gland in various degrees resulting in a volume and PSA reduction of 25 -58%. Contrary to M-TURP, in B-TURP systems, the energy does not travel through the body to reach a skin pad. Bipolar circuitry is completed locally; energy is confined between an active (resection loop) and a passive pole situated on the resectoscope tip (“true” bipolar systems) or the sheath (“quasi” bipolar systems) using normal saline for irrigation thereby eliminating TUR-syndrome [318,319]. Efficacy: In a meta-analysis of twenty RCTs with a maximum follow-up of five years, M-TURP resulted in a substantial mean Qmax improvement (+162%), a significant reduction in IPSS (-70%), QoL score (-69%), and PVR (-77%) [320]. Monopolar-TURP delivers durable outcomes as shown by studies with a follow-up of eight to 22 years [321]. One study with a mean follow-up of thirteen years reported a significant and sustained decrease in most symptoms and improvement in urodynamic parameters. Failures were associated with DUA rather than re-growth of BPH [109]. A second prostatic operation, usually re-TURP, has been reported at a constant annual rate of approximately 1-2%. A SR analysing 29 RCTs found a retreatment rate of 2.6% after a mean follow-up of sixteen months [322]. Data from an Austrian nationwide study of two cohorts totalling 41,059 men submitted to M-TURP showed that the overall retreatment rates (re-TURP, urethrotomy and bladder neck incision) remained unchanged during the last decade (0.9%, 3.7%, 9.5% and 12.7% at three months, one year, five years, and eight years, respectively), and that the respective incidence of re-TURP was 0.8%, 2.4%, 6.1% and 8.3%, respectively [323,324]. Bipolar TURP is the most widely investigated alternative to M-TURP. Pooled results from 59 RCTs have been reported to date [325]. Early pooled results as well as at twelve months, concluded that no clinically relevant differences exist in short-term efficacy (IPSS, QoL score and Qmax) [325,326]. Subsequent meta-analyses supported these conclusions though trial quality was generally poor [320,327-330]. The largest meta-analysis published to date, confirmed that B-TURP compared to M-TURP results in little to no difference in urological symptoms and bother (IPSS and QoL score) at twelve months [325]. Data from RCTs with mid- to long-term follow-up (up to 60 months) showed no differences in efficacy parameters [331-339]. A meta-analysis of RCTs comparing B-TURP vs. M-TURP, reported similar efficacy at 36 months in terms of IPSS, and Qmax [340]. A meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the quasi-bipolar transurethral resection in saline (TURis), Olympus Medical system vs. M-TURP. Ten unique RCTs (1,870 patients) were included, and it was concluded that TURis was of equivalent efficacy to M-TURP [341]. Tolerability and safety: Peri-operative mortality and morbidity of M-TURP have decreased over time, but morbidity remains considerable (0.1% and 11.1%, respectively) [342]. Data from an Austrian nationwide study of two cohorts totalling 41,059 men submitted to M-TURP showed a 20% reduction in mortality rate over time, to 0.1% at 30 days and 0.5% at 90 days [323,324]. The risk of TUR-syndrome decreased to < 1.1% [322,343]. Data from 10,654 M-TURPs reported bleeding requiring transfusion in 2.9% [342]. Short- to mid-term complications reported in an analysis of RCTs using M-TURP as a comparator were: bleeding requiring transfusion 2% (0-9%), TUR-syndrome 0.8% (0-5%), AUR 4.5% (0-13.3%), clot retention 4.9% (0-39%), and UTI 4.1% (0-22%) [320]. Long-term complications of M-TURP comprise urinary incontinence (UI), urinary retention and UTIs, bladder neck contracture (BNC), urethral stricture, retrograde ejaculation and ED [322]. Early pooled results concluded that no differences exist in short-term urethral stricture/BNC rates, but B-TURP is preferable to M-TURP due to a more favourable peri-operative safety profile (elimination of TUR-syndrome; lower clot retention/blood transfusion rates; shorter irrigation, catheterisation, and possibly hospitalisation times) [326]. Subsequent meta-analyses supported these conclusions [320,327-330,340]; however, trial quality was relatively poor and limited follow-up might cause under-reporting of late complications, such as urethral stricture/BNC [326] The largest meta-analysis published to date, concluded that B-TURP compared to M-TURP reduced TUR-syndrome and blood transfusion events by twenty and 28 fewer events per 1,000 participants, respectively [325]. The study also concluded that B-TURP may carry a similar risk of UI and may result in similar rates of re-TURP in the short-term (four fewer events and one more re-TURP per 1000 participants, respectively), compared to M-TURP [325]. An RCT based meta-analysis has shown that TURis reduces the risk of TUR-syndrome and the need for blood transfusion compared to M-TURP [330]. It was concluded that TURis is associated with improved peri-operative safety, eliminating the risk of TUR-syndrome, reducing the risk of blood transfusion/clot retention and hospital stay. No significant difference was detected in urethral stricture rates. Data from the vast majority of individual RCTs with mid- to long-term follow-up (up to 60 months), showed no differences between M-TURP and B-TURP in urethral stricture/BNC rates [331-339], in accordance with all published meta-analyses. However, two individual RCTs have shown opposing results [338,344]. A significantly higher stricture (urethral stricture + BNC) rate was detected in the B-TURP arm performed with a “quasi” bipolar system (TURis, Olympus Medical) in patients with a prostate volume > 70 mL at 36-months follow-up [338]. In addition, a significantly higher BNC, but not urethral stricture, rate was detected in the B-TURP arm performed with a “true” bipolar system (Gyrus PK SuperPulse, Olympus Medical) in 137 patients at twelve months follow-up [344]. Randomised controlled trials using the erectile function domain of the IIEF (IIEF-ED) and the ejaculatory domain of the male sexual-health questionnaire (Ej-MSHQ) showed that M-TURP and B-TURP have a similar effect on erectile and ejaculatory function [345,346]. Comparative evaluations of the effects on overall sexual function, quantified with IIEF-15, showed no differences between B-TURP and M-TURP at twelve months follow-up (erection, orgasmic function, sexual desire, intercourse satisfaction, overall satisfaction) [346,347]. Furthermore, the largest meta-analysis published to date, showed that erectile function measured by IIEF-5 appears to be similar at twelve months follow-up after B-TURP and M-TURP [325]. A comparative study [348] evaluated the safety of B-TURP in patients taking therapeutic oral anticoagulation (phenprocoumon) or anti-platelet drug therapy (acetylsalicylic acid or clopidogrel), without stopping or bridging the medication. Outcomes under acetylsalicylic acid were comparable to the unmedicated control group. Under oral anticoagulation therapy catheterisation (median 41-hours vs. 24-hours) and hospitalisation time was longer (median four days vs. three days), AUR rate was higher (18% vs. 6%), but blood transfusion rates did not differ to the control group. Under anti-platelet therapy blood transfusion (19% vs. 1%) and re-hospitalisation rates (19% vs. 3%) were higher. Practical considerations: Monopolar-TURP is an effective treatment for moderate-to-severe LUTS secondary to BPO. The choice should be based primarily on prostate volume (30-80 mL suitable for M-TURP). No studies on the optimal cut-off value exist, but the complication rates increase with prostate size [342]. The upper limit for M-TURP is suggested as 80 mL (based on Panel consensus, under the assumption that this limit depends on the surgeon’s experience, choice of resectoscope size and resection speed), as surgical duration increases, there is a significant increase in the rate of complications and the procedure is safest when performed in under 90 minutes [349]. Bipolar TURP in patients with moderate-to-severe LUTS secondary to BPO has similar efficacy with M-TURP but lower peri-operative morbidity. The duration of improvements with B-TURP were documented in a number of RCTs with mid-term follow-up. Long-term results (up to five years) for B-TURP showed that safety and efficacy are comparable to M-TURP [331-339]. The choice of B-TURP should be based on equipment availability, surgeon’s experience, and patient’s preference. Summary of evidenceLEBipolar- or M-TURP is the current standard surgical procedure for men with prostate sizes of 30-80 mL and bothersome moderate-to-severe LUTS secondary of BPO.1aBipolar-TURP achieves short-, mid- and long-term results comparable with M-TURP, but B-TURP has a more favourable peri-operative safety profile.1a RecommendationStrength ratingOffer bipolar- or monopolar-transurethral resection of the prostate to surgically treat moderate-to-severe LUTS in men with prostate size of 30-80 mL.Strong 5.3.1.2. Holmium laser resection of the prostate With the advent of holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (section 5.3.2.3) and the fact that no relevant publications on holmium laser resection of the prostate (HoLRP) have been published since 2004, HoLRP of the prostate does not play a role in contemporary treatment algorithms. 5.3.1.3. Thulium:yttrium-aluminium-garnet laser vaporesection of the prostate Mechanism of action: In the Thulium:yttrium-aluminium-garnet laser (Tm:YAG), a wavelength between 1,940 and 2,013 nm is emitted in continuous wave mode. The laser is primarily used in front-fire applications [350]. Different applications such as vaporesection (ThuVARP) have been published [351]. Efficacy: Several meta-analyses with pooled data from both RCTs, and non-RCTs have evaluated ThuVARP vs. M-TURP [352-354], and B-TURP [355-357]. The largest meta-analyses included nine RCTs and seven non-RCTs and reported no clinically relevant differences in efficacy (IPSS, QoL score and Qmax) between ThuVARP and M-TURP or B-TURP at twelve months [356]. A multicentre, RCT with 410 men reported that ThuVARP and TURP are equivalent in terms of IPSS but not Qmax, with TURP deemed superior at twelve months follow-up [358]. The beneficial effect of TURP in terms of Qmax was strengthened in men aged < 70 years and in those diagnosed with LUTS rather than urinary retention. No differences in individual patient-reported urinary symptoms were seen between arms, with the exception of some evidence to indicate potential reduction in nocturia in the TURP arm. Data from one RCT with long-term follow-up showed no difference in efficacy and re-operation rates between ThuVARP and M-TURP (2.1% vs. 4.1%, respectively) [359]. A prospective multicentre study on ThuVARP, including 2,216 patients, showed durable post-operative improvement in IPSS, QoL, Qmax, and PVR for the entire eight years of follow-up [360]. Tolerability and safety: In a number of meta-analyses longer operation times, shorter catheterisation/hospitalisation times and less blood loss without significant differences in transfusion rates or in any other short-term complication rates have been reported for ThuVARP compared to TURP [352-357]. A significantly higher transfusion rate was reported after M-TURP in two meta-analyses [354,356]. However, overall RCT quality was relatively low with limited follow-up potentially accounting for under-reporting of late complications, such as urethral stricture/BNC [356]. A multicentre RCT with 410 men, followed up for twelve months reported that ThuVARP and TURP show similar operation, catheterisation, and hospitalisation times between arms with no difference in the frequency or severity of surgical complications or in blood transfusions rate or haemoglobin change [358,361]. Patients with urinary retention had similarly positive outcomes to those with LUTS [358,361]. Data from three RCTs with mid- to long-term follow-up (18 to 48 months) showed no differences in late complication rates between ThuVARP and TURP [359,362,363]. Haemoglobin drop was significantly higher in the bridging group in a retrospectively analysed case series of 103 patients who underwent ThuVARP and received either low molecular weight heparin bridging or continued antiplatelet/anticoagulant therapy [364]. Practical considerations: As a limited number of RCTs with mid- to long-term follow-up support the efficacy of ThuVARP, there is a need for ongoing investigation of the technique. Summary of evidenceLELaser vaporesection of the prostate using Tm:YAG laser (ThuVARP) has similar operation, catheterisation and hospitalisation times compared to TURP. ThuVARP and TURP are equivalent in terms of IPSS but not Qmax, with TURP deemed superior at twelve months follow-up. ThuVARP and TURP show similar short-term safety. Mid- to long-term results on efficacy and safety compared to TURP are very limited.1b RecommendationStrength ratingOffer laser resection of the prostate using Tm:YAG laser (ThuVARP) as an alternative to TURP.Weak 5.3.1.4. Transurethral incision of the prostate Mechanism of action: Transurethral incision of the prostate (TUIP) involves incising the bladder outlet without relevant tissue removal. Transurethral incision of the prostate is conventionally performed with Collins knife using electrocautery; however, alternative energy sources such as holmium laser may be used [365]. The mainstay of this technique is in prostate sizes < 30 mL without a middle lobe. Efficacy: An RCT comparing conventional TUIP vs. TUIP using holmium laser in prostates ≤ 30 mL with a follow-up of twelve months, found both procedures to be equally effective in relieving BOO with similarly low re-operation rates [365]. A meta-analysis of ten RCTs found similar LUTS improvements and lower but significant improvements in Qmax for TUIP [366]. In this meta-analysis, an upper limit of prostate size was reported as an entry criterion for eight studies with five < 30 mL and three < 60 mL. A meta-analysis of six trials showed that re-operation was more common after TUIP (18.4%) than after M-TURP (7.2%) [366]. Tolerability and safety: An RCT comparing conventional TUIP vs. TUIP using holmium laser reported both procedures to be safe with low complication rates; however, the operation time and retrograde ejaculation rate was significantly lower in the conventional TUIP arm [365]. No cases of TUR-syndrome have been recorded after TUIP. The risk of bleeding after TUIP is small [366]. Practical considerations: Transurethral incision of the prostate is an effective treatment for moderate-to-severe LUTS secondary to BPO. The choice between M-TURP and TUIP should be based primarily on prostate volume (< 30 mL TUIP) [366]. Summary of evidenceLETransurethral incision of the prostate shows similar efficacy and safety to M-TURP for treating moderate-to-severe LUTS secondary to BPO in men with prostates < 30 mL.1aNo case of TUR-syndrome has been recorded, the risk of bleeding requiring transfusion is negligible and retrograde ejaculation rate is significantly lower after TUIP, but the re-operation rate is higher compared to M-TURP.1aThe choice between TUIP and TURP should be based primarily on prostate volume (< 30 mL and 30-80 mL suitable for TUIP and TURP, respectively).4 RecommendationStrength ratingOffer transurethral incision of the prostate to surgically treat moderate-to-severe LUTS in men with prostate size < 30 mL, without a middle lobe.Strong
