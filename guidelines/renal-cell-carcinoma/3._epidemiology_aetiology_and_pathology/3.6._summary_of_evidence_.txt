3.6. Summary of evidence and recommendations for the management of other renal tumours. Summary of evidenceLEA variety of renal tumours exist of which approximately 15% are benign .3The most common renal tumours are three malignant types of RCC (clear cell, papillary and chromophobe) and two benign renal tumours: oncocytoma and angiomyolipoma.3A definitive histopathological diagnosis of oncocytoma cannot be made on a needle-core biopsy, because chRCC can show intratumoural heterogeneity with areas very similar to oncocytoma.3Histological work up and results of AS of Bosniak III cysts shows low risk of malignant potential/course.2 RecommendationsStrength ratingManage Bosniak type III cysts the same as localised RCC, or offer active surveillance (AS).WeakManage Bosniak type IV cysts the same as localised RCC.StrongOffer AS to patients with biopsy-proven oncocytoma or other oncocytic renal tumours as an acceptable alternative to surgery or ablation.WeakTreat angiomyolipoma (AML) with selective arterial embolisation or nephron-sparing surgery, in:large tumours (a recommended threshold of intervention does not exist);females of childbearing age;patients in whom follow-up or access to emergency care may be inadequate;persistent pain or acute or repeated bleeding episodes.WeakOffer systemic therapy (everolimus) to patients at need for therapy with surgically unresectable AMLs not amendable to embolisation.Weak
