7.4. follow-up: first line hormonal treatment (androgen sensitive period). 7.4.1. introduction androgen deprivation therapy used various situations: combined rt localised locally-advanced disease, monotherapy relapse local treatment, presence metastatic disease often combination treatments. situations based benefits testosterone blockage suppression either drugs (lhrh agonists antagonists)

cannot replaced imaging laboratory tests alone. 7.4.2. purpose follow-up main objectives follow-up patients receiving adt ensure treatment compliance, monitor treatment response, detect side effects early, guide treatment time point clinical progression. initiation adt, recommended patients evaluated every three six months. must individualised patient advised contact physician event troublesome symptoms. even important patients receive combination adt potent medication, e.g., arpi frequency follow-up monthly first three months, disease. 7.4.3. general follow-up men adt patients adt require regular follow-up, including monitoring serum testosterone, creatinine, liver function metabolic parameters three six month intervals. men adt experience toxicity independent disease stage. androgen deprivation therapy reduces bone density gradually, increasing risk fractures . therefore essential asses bone density treatment adt without combination drugs. consequenses adt varying, structured follow-up including lab results, radiology qol, may value patient treating physician . 7.4.3.1. testosterone monitoring testosterone monitoring considered standard clinical practice men adt. many men receiving medical castration achieve castrate testosterone level (< 20 ng/dl), testosterone level < 50 ng/dl. however, approximately 13–38% patients fail achieve levels 24% men may experience temporary testosterone surges (testosterone > 50 ng/dl) long-term treatment referred ‘acute on-chronic effect’ ‘breakthrough response’ . breakthrough rates < 20 ng/dl threshold found frequent (41.3%) association worse clinical outcomes suggested . timing measurements clearly defined. three six month testosterone level assessment suggested ensure castration achieved (especially medical castration)
