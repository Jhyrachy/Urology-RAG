7.2. Quality of life and long-term toxicities after cure of testicular cancer. The vast majority of patients will be cured with five-year relative survival rates of approximately 95% in Western Europe. Testicular cancer patients are usually between 18-40 years of age at diagnosis and life expectancy after cure extends over several decades [284]. Patients should be informed before treatment of common long-term toxicities, which are avoided or minimised by adherence to international guidelines. During follow-up, patients should be screened and treated for known risk factors such as hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, and testosterone deficiency. Adverse health outcomes (AHOs) are more commonly found in TC patients who received chemotherapy than those cured by surgery alone. Further, modifiable risk factors do contribute to AHOs like hypertension and noise exposure to hearing impairment or smoking to Raynaud phenomenon [285]. Therefore, a healthy lifestyle should be promoted during the follow-up consultations. Adverse health outcomes are associated with unemployment, which is found clearly increased in TC survivors (TCSs) as compared to a male normative population [286]. When follow-up by the TC clinician is terminated, a written cancer survivorship plan addressing late toxic effects, lifestyle recommendations, recurrence risk, and cancer-specific follow-up may be helpful [203,287]. *For more information regarding long term toxicities and quality of life issues, please see appendix 3, available online https://uroweb.org/guidelines/testicular-cancer/publications-appendices
