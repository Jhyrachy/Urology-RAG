penis occurs commonly penile shaft varying 0.1 1 cm diameter. epithelium lined filled keratin. painless swelling present age group history circumcision. treatment total surgical excision mainly indicated cosmetic symptomatic (e.g. infection) reasons performed without rupturing cyst avoid recurrence .mucoid cyst penis synonymous parameatal cyst genitoperineal cyst median raphe; midline developmental cysts arising ectopic urethral mucosa filled mucoid material. present since birth usually detected adolescence later. usually asymptomatic developing penile ventral surface around glans require surgical removal either cosmetic, functional symptomatic reasons .median raphe cysts arise incomplete closure genital fold embryogenesis; commonly diagnosed first decade life present later tend asymptomatic . either unilocular multilocular fluid containing cysts, mean size 0.8 cm cysts larger 2 cm also reported . cysts centred dermis, connection urethra epidermis. histopathologically, 4 types: urethral (urothelium-like epithelium, account 55% cases), epidermoid, glandular mixed. treated conservatively resolve spontaneously persist. cyst aspiration associated high risk recurrence surgical excision treatment choice. though penile cysts asymptomatic, may get infected resulting pain tenderness. also present ulceration, rupture urinary obstruction close urethral meatus. along cosmetic issues means caregivers patients opt surgical excision.smegmal cysts smegmal pearls differential cysts above; benign collection smegma sub-preputial space uncircumcised boys anticipated spontaneous resolution .dermoid cyst congenital, asymptomatic, firm, solitary, subcutaneous cystic lesions occurring commonly region corona involving foreskin. histopathologically contain sweat sebaceous glands elements hair squamous epithelium. pilosebaceous cysts described glans; benign usually diagnosed excision. 3.20.3.2. vascular malformations broad classification penile vascular lesions haemangiomas vascular malformations proposed ramos 1999 . haemangiomas develop rapidly birth involute slowly; also include pyogenic granulomas benign outgrowths cutaneous capillary vessels formed usually chronic irritation . growth cycle infantile haemangiomas divided early late proliferative stages, followed slow involution phase, completing growth nine months age . propranolol currently first line treatment infantile haemangiomas, exact mechanism action unknown include inhibition angiogenesis, vasoconstriction among others. dose range 1.5-2.5 mg/kg, needs continued 12 18 months tapered active passive weaning reduce risk rebound growth . factors leading rebound growth propranolol treatment include deep haemangiomas, occur 38% patients despite propranolol therapy, requiring local therapy topical timolol, pulsed dye laser intralesional steroids. twelve months, median improvement treatment reported 81% (range 70-90%) based vas scores serial patient photographs. vascular malformations congenital lesions capillary, lymphatic venous (or slow-flow) arterial/arteriovenous (fast-flow) origin enlarge slowly patient grows. include glomus tumours, primarily congenital arteriovenous shunts develop thermo-regulatory glomus bodies (fastflow vascular malformations). glomus tumours penis arise glans penis, corpora penis periurethral masses, sometimes accompanied glomus tumours fingers feet . usually asymptomatic presentation may symptoms priapism, palpitation perineal pain. glomus tumours benign despite exhibiting high grade nuclear polymorphism. vascular malformations usually benign treated either laser, sclerotherapy surgical excision. however, glomus tumours specifically need surgical treatment follow-up due risk recurrence incomplete excision . 3.20.3.3. neurogenic lesions penile neurofibroma extremely rare lesion arising perineural schwann cells, occurs usually evidence systemic neurofibromatosis von recklinghausen syndrome . treated successfully complete excision . rare cases malignant schwanomas penis presumably secondary malignant transformation benign neurofibromas reported boys strong family history neurofibromatosis. type malignant degeneration neurofibromatosis occurs reportedly 5-16% children . hence, patients require long-term follow-up due risk recurrence, new tumour formation malignant transformation. 3.20.3.4. soft tissue tumours penis mesenchymal tumours rare external genitalia require excision order differentiate benign malignant neoplasms. histopathological characterisation essential ensure malignant tumours receive radical treatment adjuvant therapy close follow-up . presentation usually painless penile mass, non-tender rubbery examination. ultrasound maybe useful characterising lesion diagnostic; exclude urethral invasion close urethra . excision biopsy performed, aggressive malignant components found, wider resection may needed. fibrosarcoma rare non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue tumour arises fibrous tissue. infantile form fibrosarcoma rare occurring penis even rarer paediatric age-group. surgical intervention favourable prognosis paediatric age group long-term survival 90% sporadic cases . myofibroma benign congenital lesion occurs either solitary lesion part myofibromatosis multiple soft tissue tumours. excision necessary histological diagnosis . primary penile teratomas extremely rare subtype congenital germ cell tumours, tend asymptomatic subdermal us blood flow doppler . need aggressive treatment surgical resection due unpredictable behavior unresponsiveness chemotherapy. mature teratomas benign immature teratoma even mixed teratomas immature components turn malignant potential metastasise recur. 3.20.3.5.penile lymphedema lymphedema adults usually secondary malignancy infectious disease affecting lymphatic drainage. paediatric age group, however, lymphedema usually primary generally rare, affecting 1.2 per 100.000 persons age 20 years . these, small fraction relates genital region. regardless underlying aetiology, inefficient lymphatic drainage leads accumulation subcutaneous lymph causes tissue swelling inflammation. turn stimulates adipose deposition fibrosis exacerbating enlargement. time edematous tissue becomes vulnerable infection, chronic cutaneous changes disfigurement . additionally, occurring genital region urological complications may ensue; phimosis, haematuria, bleeding, bladder outlet obstruction, pain, dysuria, lymphorrhea severe psychological distress due resultant deformity . largest cohort male genital oedema paediatric age group, 92% cases primary; 25% discernable familial syndromic association noonan syndrome, lymphedemadistichiasis milroy disease . secondary genital lymphedema children reported inguinal surgery, non-caseating granulomatous lymphangitis seen metastatic crohn’s disease [1465-1467]. average age onset reported 4.5 ± 6.3 years 61% presenting infancy, 13% childhood remaining 26% adolescence. edema usually penoscrotal 72%, isolated scrotal 24% rarely confined exclusively penis 4%. moreover, concomitant lower limb edema rule two thirds cases . general consensus diagnostic work-up patients. history physical examination (including family history) usually sufficient. however lymphoscintigraphy used confirmatory test, limb genital edema results difficult interpret . ultrasonography nonspecific, advocated exclude secondary lymphedema examining patency iliac caval vessels . magnetic resonance imaging useful exclude differential diagnoses venous lymphatic anomalies . conservative treatment accepted first-line treatment. mainstay compression therapy maintain prevent swelling. achieved compression stockings undergarments. additionally, close observation protection skin prevent excoriations infection essential . compression therapy however, less effective genital oedema limb edema, especially growing children. conservative management fails, especially symptomatic cases, patients functional impairment, surgical debulking may necessary. either take form circumcision cases foreskin affected excision affected skin subcutaneous tissues restructuring contouring optimal cosmetic outcome. complete skin excision grafting may also required [1465-1468]. surgical management challenging needs restricted patients significant symptoms. complications include recurrences, continuous lymphatic leakage, haematoma, infection poor cosmetic outcome . summary evidencelecystic penile lesions commonest paediatric penile lesions followed vascular malformations neurogenic lesions.3neurofibroma patients require long-term followup due risk recurrence, new tumour formation malignant transformation.3mesenchymal tumours rare require excision order differentiate benign malignant neoplasms.3 recommendationslestrength ratingtreatment penile cystic lesions total surgical excision, mainly indicated cosmetic symptomatic (e.g. infection) reasons.4weakpropranolol currently first line treatment infantile hemangiomas.2bstrongconservative management first-line treatment penile lymphedema.4strongin symptomatic cases patients functional impairment, surgical intervention may become necessary penile lymphedema.4weak
