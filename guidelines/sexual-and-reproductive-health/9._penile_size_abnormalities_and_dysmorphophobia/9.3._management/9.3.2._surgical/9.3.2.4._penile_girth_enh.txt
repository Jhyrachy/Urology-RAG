9.3.2.4. Penile girth enhancement. 9.3.2.4.1. Penile Girth enhancement history Nomograms were created for penile girth measurements, including flaccid penis circumference (n = 9407, 9.31 ± 0.90 cm) and erect circumference (n = 381, 11.66 ± 1.10 cm) [1136]. Unlike penile lengthening, there are no precise definitions or indications for penile girth enlargement in the literature or existing international guidelines [1292]. In recent years, men have increasingly approached urologists for penile girth enhancement to increase their self-confidence, to be cosmetically satisfied or to satisfy their partners [1293]. Current reports on penile girth enhancement techniques are from recent years [1293,1294]. Although these surgical techniques are more and more frequently requested, the level of evidence for their use in clinical practice is low, notwithstanding the ethical considerations of surgery in this vulnerable group of patients. 9.3.2.4.2. Injection therapy Injectable filling materials can be classified according to their different properties. They can be autologous, biological or synthetic. The fat injection material is obtained from the patient’s own tissue (autologous), usually by liposuction (see the following surgical therapy section). Biological fillers can be of human and animal (collagen) or bacterial (Hyaluronic acid) origin. Poly-l-lactic acid (PLA), hydroxyethyl methacrylate, polyalkylimide hydrogel (PAAG), polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), calcium hydroxyapatite (CHA), silicon and paraffin constitute filler materials of synthetic origin (Table 30) [1295].

Soft tissue fillers (Hyaluronic acid and PMMA) Hyaluronic acid Injection of hyaluronic acid (HA) gel is one of the most commonly used injectable fillers in the field of plastic surgery [1237,1296]. The application of HA for penile girth enhancement has recently gained increasing popularity due to its biocompatibility and infrequent mild temporary side effects. The newly invented cross-linked HA has a more lasting effect over time [1297]. Hyaluronic acid has been used for patients for penile girth enhancement. Studies have reported that an increase of 1.4 to 3.78 cm in penile girth is achieved with HA injection (Table 31). Patient satisfaction is high (78-100%) and no severe side effects have been reported [704,1298-1301].

Polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) Polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) microspheres have been injected as a wrinkle filler. An average increase in penile circumference of 3.5 cm was reported in two studies using PMMA for penile girth enhancement [1304,1305]. The authors reported that post-operative swelling and inflammatory reaction resolved within a few days and no pattern of PMMA microspheres migration to neighbouring regions was seen. Poly-l-lactic acid Poly-l-lactic acid (PLA) is another widely used soft tissue filler. Poly-l-lactic acid has enhanced effects by stimulating fibroblast proliferation and increasing collagen deposition in tissue. An average increase of 1.2 to 2.4 cm has been reported in the penile girth with PLA injection. No complications other than temporary local pain and swelling were reported in the treated patients [1298,1306]. 9.3.2.4.2.2. Other Fillers (silicone, paraffin) Foreign body injections are still frequently practised in many countries (especially in East Asia and East Europe), either by the patient himself or by healthcare workers, using various substances such as paraffin, silicone or petroleum jelly (Vaseline), to increase the circumference of the penis [1307]. This results in a chronic granulomatous inflammatory foreign body reaction [1307,1308]. The result of this practice is a pathological condition called sclerosing lipogranuloma of the penis also referred as paraffinoma or siliconoma according to the substance used [1307]. The resultant inflammatory process ranges from oedema and infection to Fournier’s gangrene. Penile reconstructive surgeries may be required when siliconoma and paraffinoma require excision [1307-1313]. 9.3.2.4.3. Surgical therapy 9.3.2.4.3.1. Autologous fat injection This is a surgical technique based on thinning the lower abdomen with liposuction and injecting the harvested fat tissue into the penile shaft [1314-1317]. In retrospective studies, an average increase of 2 to 3.5 cm in penile circumference was reported in patients who underwent autologous fat injection. No statistically significant decrease was observed in IIEF scores and no serious adverse events, such as penile abscess or deformity requiring reoperation occurred. Post-operative satisfaction survey showed that more than 75% of patients were satisfied (Table 32) [1280,1314,1315,1318].

Grafting procedures (albugineal and peri-cavernosal) Until more rigorous multi-institutional studies reporting on complications and validated outcomes are known, penile girth enhancement procedures using grafts should be considered experimental (Table 33). In a study of 69 patients using the porcine dermal acellular matrix graft (InteXen; American Medical Systems, Minnetonka, MN, USA) a 3.2 cm increase in flaccid state and 2.4 cm in erect state was reported at one year following surgery. The procedure was performed with an infrapubic incision, and 68 of 69 patients reported significant satisfaction using the Augmentation Phalloplasty Patient Selection and Satisfaction Inventory. Graft fibrosis has been observed in up to 13% of patients, and a mean reduction in penile length of 0.5 cm has been reported in patients with fibrosis [1319]. Techniques using venous grafts for penile girth enhancement have also been described [1320]. Initial results are encouraging, but better designed RCTs are needed. Dermal fat grafts are free only grafts composed of deepithelialized dermis and subcutaneous fat. An area of approximately 10 x 5 cm is required for graft harvesting. An increase in penile girth of 1.67 to 2.3 cm has been reported in studies with the dermal fat graft technique. Penile oedema up to 27%, painful erection up to 27%, and curvature due to graft fibrosis up to 9% have been reported. Side effects such as penile hypoesthesia, skin necrosis, and infection were not reported [1250,1321,1322].

Biodegradable scaffolds This is a technique based on using fibroblasts (harvested from patients’ own scrotum skin and dartos tissue) in tissue cultures and seeding them in microporous biodegradable poly-lacti-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) scaffolds and implanting these scaffolds between Dartos and Buck’s fascia. A limited number of studies have reported girth gain of up to 4.02 cm with implantation of biodegradable scaffolds [1326-1328] (Table 34).

Subcutaneous penile implant (Penuma®) Recently, a silicone penile implant called “Penuma®” (International Medical Devices [Beverly Hills, CA, USA]) has been approved and has shown promising results for penile girth enhancement. Penuma® is a soft silicone subcutaneous implant placed on 3/4 of the penile shaft and fixed to the glans with a polyester mesh [1323]. Studies have reported an average increase in penile circumference of 2 to 5 cm with Penuma® insertion. According to published data complication rates (usually mild and transient, occur in <5%) and the removal rate (1%) of the implant has been reported to be relatively low [1323,1329]. 9.3.2.4.4. Summary of evidence and recommendations for penile girth enhancement Summary of evidenceLEVarious surgical approaches with specific outcomes and complications have been considered to address penile girth enhancement, with limited benefit.3Hyaluronic acid (HA), Poly-l-lactic acid (PLA), hydroxyethyl methacrylate, polyacrylamide hydrogel (PAAG), polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), calcium hydroxyapatite are used as injectable materials for penile girth enhancement.3Patient satisfaction with soft tissue fillers (especially HA, PMMA and PLA) is high (> 78%).3No complications other than temporary local pain and swelling were reported in patients treated with soft tissue fillers.3Using silicone, paraffin and petroleum jelly (Vaseline) in penile girth enhancement causes a range of complications ranging from oedema up to infection to Fournier’s gangrene.3Not enough long term data are available on autologous fat injection for penile girth enhancement.4Not enough long term data are available on grafting procedures (dermal acellular matrix graft, venous grafts or dermal fat grafts).4Grafting procedures are associated with high complication rate and low rate of patient’s satisfaction.3Not enough long term data are available on biodegradable scaffolds and subcutaneous penile implant (Penuma®) .4 RecommendationsStrength ratingCounsel patients extensively regarding the risks and benefits of penile girth enhancement techniques.StrongDo not use silicone, paraffin and petroleum jelly (Vaseline) to address penile girth enhancement.StrongUse hyaluronic acid, soft tissue fillers and autologous fat injection to address penile girth enhancement.WeakDo not use hyaluronic acid, soft tissue fillers and autologous fat injection to address penile girth enhancement in men with penile dysmorphic disorder.WeakDo not use grafts in penile girth enhancement as they are considered experimental.StrongDo not use biodegradable scaffolds and subcutaneous penile implant (Penuma®) to address penile girth enhancement as experimental.Strong Figure 11: Management of short penile size* Penile length should be measured stretched both from the penopubic skin junction-to-glans tip (STT) and from the pubic bone-to-glans tip (BTT).# There is a lack of evidence to recommend one treatment over another. **Hyaluronic acid (HA), poly-l-lactic acid (PLA), hydroxyethyl methacrylate, polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), polyacrylamide hydrogel (PAAG) and calcium hydroxyapatite are considered as injectable materials for penile girth enhancement.
