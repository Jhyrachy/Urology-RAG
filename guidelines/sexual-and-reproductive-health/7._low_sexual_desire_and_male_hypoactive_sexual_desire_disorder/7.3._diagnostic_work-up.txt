7.3. Diagnostic work-up. 7.3.1. Assessment questionnaires Sexual Desire Inventory (SDI) evaluates different components influencing the development and expression of sexual desire [830]. This self-administered questionnaire consists of 14 questions that weigh the strength, frequency, and significance of an individual’s desire for sexual activity with others and by themselves. The SDI suggests that desire can be split into two categories: dyadic and solitary desire. While dyadic desire refers to “interest in or a wish to engage in sexual activity with another person and desire for sharing and intimacy with another”, solitary desire refers to “an interest in engaging in sexual behaviour by oneself and may involve a wish to refrain from intimacy and sharing with others” [830]. 7.3.2. Physical examination and investigations Similar to other forms of sexual dysfunctions, a thorough medical and sexual history must be obtained from men who complain of LSD. The depressive symptoms of the patients must be assessed [831] and relationship problems (e.g., conflict with the sexual partner) must be questioned. In the presence of accompanying symptoms suggestive of endocrinological problems, circulating total testosterone [832], prolactin [833] and thyroid hormones [555] levels can be evaluated.
