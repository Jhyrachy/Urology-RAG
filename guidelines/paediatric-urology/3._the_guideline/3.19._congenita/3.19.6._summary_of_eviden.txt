3.19.6. Summary of evidence and recommendations for the management of posterior urethral valves. Summary of evidenceLEPosterior urethral valves are one of the few life-threatening congenital anomalies of the urinary tract.1bAntenatal therapy could be considered based on ultrasound findings, fetal urine biochemistry, amniotic fluid level, and chromosomal status.4Serum creatinine nadir above 0.85 mg/dL is correlated with a poor prognosis.2aNeonatal circumcision as an adjunct to antibiotic prophylaxis in PUV patients significantly decreases the risk of developing febrile UTIs during the first two years of life.1bEarly pharmacological management with oxybutynin may improve bladder function.1bDespite optimal treatment, 20% of patients will develop ESRD.2aRenal transplantation in these patients is safe and effective, if the bladder function is managed.3 RecommendationsStrength ratingDrain the bladder in new-borns with a suspected diagnosis of infravesical obstruction and place on antibiotic prophylaxisStrongPerform a voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) in patients in whom a diagnosis of posterior urethral valves (PUV) is suspected.StrongAttempt endoscopic valve ablation after bladder drainage and stabilisation of the child.WeakConsider neonatal circumcision as an adjunct to antibiotic prophylaxis to decrease the risk of urinary tract infection in those with a PUV, especially in the presence of high grade vesicoureteric reflux.StrongOffer prolonged urinary diversion (suprapubic/transurethral) for bladder drainage if the child is too small for valve ablation.StrongUse serum creatinine nadir as a prognostic marker.StrongAssess split renal function by dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan or mercaptoacetyltriglycine (MAG3) clearance.StrongConsider high urinary diversion if bladder drainage is insufficient to drain the upper urinary tract, or in the absence of clinico-biochemical improvement.StrongMonitor and manage bladder and renal function lifelong.Strong
