8.2.4. Local primary whole-gland treatments other than surgery or radiotherapy. 8.2.4.1. Cryosurgery In a SR and meta-analysis there was evidence that the rate of urinary incontinence at one year was lower for cryotherapy than for RP, but the size of the difference decreased with longer follow-up [738]. There was no significant difference between cryotherapy vs. EBRT in terms of urinary incontinence at one year (< 1%); cryotherapy had a similar ED rate (range 0–40%) to RP at one year. There were insufficient data to compare cryotherapy vs. EBRT in terms of ED. 8.2.4.2. High-intensity focused ultrasound In terms of toxicity there are insufficient data on urinary incontinence, ED, or bowel dysfunction to draw any conclusions, although at one-year HIFU had lower incontinence rates than RP (OR: 0.06, 95% CI: 0.01–0.48) [738].
