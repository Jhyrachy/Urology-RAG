3.4.12. Steinstrasse. Steinstrasse is an accumulation of stone fragments or stone gravel in the ureter and may interfere with the passage of urine [396]. Steinstrasse occurs in 4% of cases of SWL [175,183], and the major factor in the development of steinstrasse formation is stone size [397]. A major problem of steinstrasse is ureteral obstruction, which may be silent in up to 23% of cases. A MA including eight RCTs (n = 876) suggested a benefit of stenting before SWL in terms of steinstrasse formation but did not result in a benefit on SFRs or less auxiliary treatments [136]. When steinstrasse is asymptomatic, conservative treatment is an initial option. Medical expulsion therapy increases stone expulsion and reduces the need for endoscopic intervention [398,399]. Ureteroscopy and SWL are effective in the treatment of steinstrasse [185,400]. In the event of UTI or fever, the urinary system should be decompressed, preferably by percutaneous nephrostomy [113,401]. 3.4.12.1.
