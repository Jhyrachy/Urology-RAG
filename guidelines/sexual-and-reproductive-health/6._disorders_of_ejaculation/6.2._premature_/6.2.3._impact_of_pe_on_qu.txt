6.2.3. Impact of PE on quality of life. Men with PE are more likely to report low satisfaction with their sexual relationship, low satisfaction with sexual intercourse, difficulty relaxing during intercourse, and less-frequent intercourse [583-585]. Premature ejaculation can have a detrimental effect on self-confidence and the relationship with the partner, and may sometimes cause mental distress, anxiety, embarrassment and depression [583,586,587]. Moreover, PE may also affect the partner’s sexual functioning and their satisfaction with the sexual relationship decreases with increasing severity of the patient’s condition [588-590]. Despite the possible serious psychological and QoL consequences of PE, few men seek treatment [198,205,591-594].
