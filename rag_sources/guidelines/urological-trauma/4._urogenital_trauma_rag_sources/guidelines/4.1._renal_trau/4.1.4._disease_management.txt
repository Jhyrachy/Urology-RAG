4.1.4. disease management. 4.1.4.1. non-operative management non-operative management renal trauma viewed “package care”; stepwise approach starting conservative treatment, followed minimally invasive and/or surgical exploration, necessary. noted algorithm “package care” vary different centres according available interventions; however, importance escalation treatment interventions emphasised . approach likely resulted rate nephrectomy high-grade renal injuries decreasing time . 4.1.4.1.1. blunt renal injuries haemodynamic stability primary criterion management renal injuries. non-operative management become treatment choice cases. stable patients, means period bed rest, serial blood tests, regular observation re-imaging indicated . primary conservative management associated lower rate nephrectomies, increase immediate long-term morbidity . grade 1-3 injuries managed non-operatively . grade 4 injuries also mostly treated conservatively, requirement subsequent intervention higher . persistent urinary extravasation otherwise viable kidney blunt trauma usually responds stent placement and/or percutaneous drainage . grade 5 injuries often present haemodynamic instability major associated injuries. thus higher rate exploration nephrectomy . however, several studies support expectant management patients grade 4 5 injuries [29,30,68-72]. similarly, unilateral main arterial injuries arterial thrombosis normally managed non-operatively haemodynamically stable patients surgical repair reserved bilateral artery injuries injuries involving solitary functional kidney . pre-hospital prolonged warm ischaemia usually results irreparable damage renal loss. one study designed nomogram predict need intervention stop bleeding high-grade renal trauma. factors increased risk intervention haematoma size > 12 cm, penetrating trauma, vascular contrast extravasation, pararenal haematoma extension, concomitant injuries, shock . 4.1.4.1.2. penetrating renal injuries penetrating abdominal wounds traditionally managed surgically. however, selective non-operative management penetrating abdominal wounds accepted following detailed assessment stable patients [64,75-77]. renal injuries, site wound, haemodynamic stability, diagnostic imaging main determinants intervention. majority low-grade stab wounds posterior anterior axillary line managed non-operatively stable patients . grade 3 higher injuries due stab wounds stable patients managed expectantly warrant closer observation clinical course unpredictable associated higher rate delayed intervention . high-grade injuries, concomitant abdominal injuries gunshot wounds likely fail non-operative management . gunshot wound independent risk factor nephrectomy grade iv v traumatic renal injuries, compared stab wounds . overall, non-operative management penetrating injuries selected stable patients associated successful outcome 50% stab wounds 40% gunshot wounds [30,81-84]. 4.1.4.1.3. selective angioembolisation selective angioembolisation (ae) key role non-operative management blunt renal trauma haemodynamically stable patients . currently validated criteria identify patients require ae use renal trauma remains variable. accepted ct findings indicating need ae active extravasation contrast, arteriovenous fistula (avf) pseudo-aneurysm . presence active extravasation contrast large haematoma (> 25 mm depth) predict need ae good accuracy . angioembolisation utilised non-operative management grades renal injury; however, likely beneficial setting high-grade renal trauma (aast > 3) [88-90]. non-operative management high-grade renal trauma, ae included management algorithm, successful 94.9% grade 3, 89% grade 4 76% grade 5 injuries [85,88,91-93]. increasing grade renal injury associated increased risk failed ae need repeat intervention . gross haematuria, haemodynamic instability, grade 5 trauma urinary extravasation significant predictors ae failure . repeat embolisation prevents nephrectomy 67% patients. open surgery failed embolisation usually results nephrectomy . despite concerns regarding parenchymal infarction use iodinated contrast media, ae appear affect occurrence outcome acute kidney injury following renal trauma . high-grade injuries, ae also shown high success rate provide greatest protection renal function, difference renal function long-term follow-up . severe polytrauma high operative risk, main artery may embolised, either definitive treatment step controlled nephrectomy. evidence supporting ae penetrating renal trauma sparse. one study found ae three times likely fail penetrating trauma . however, ae used successfully treat acute haemorrhage, avf pseudo-aneurysms resulting penetrating renal trauma . 4.1.4.1.4. ureteral stenting urinary catheterisation management high-grade renal trauma collecting system injuries, ureteral stenting asymptomatic patients proven clear benefits. current evidence suggests intervention (ureteral stenting, nephrostomy perirenal drainage) patients develop symptoms (flank pain, fever, leucocytosis) related persistent urinary leaks . catheterisation necessary stable patients low-grade injury. patients severe visible haematuria, require monitoring stenting, benefit catheterisation. longer period catheterisation required stent placed. haematuria lightens patient mobile, catheter removed. 4.1.4.1.5. repeat imaging (early) computed tomography scans performed patients fever, unexplained decreased haematocrit, significant flank pain. repeat imaging also recommended high-grade injury penetrating trauma two four days trauma minimise risk missed complications. repeat imaging safely omitted patients grade 1-3 injuries long remain clinically well . 4.1.4.2. surgical management 4.1.4.2.1. indications renal exploration non- transient- response initial fluid resuscitation strong indication exploration . trend towards ongoing resuscitation ae . exploration influenced aetiology grade injury, transfusion requirements, need explore associated abdominal injuries, discovery expanding pulsatile peri-renal haematoma laparotomy . haemodynamic instable grade 5 vascular injuries indication exploration . 4.1.4.2.2. operative findings reconstruction overall exploration rate blunt trauma low . goals exploration following renal trauma vascular control renal salvage. series recommend transperitoneal approach surgery . entering retroperitoneum leaving confined haematoma undisturbed within perinephric fascia recommended; temporarily packing fossa tightly laparotomy pads salvage kidney instances intra-operative haemorrhage . access pedicle obtained either posterior parietal peritoneum, incised aorta, medial inferior mesenteric vein bluntly dissecting along plane psoas muscle fascia, adjacent great vessels, directly placing vascular clamp hilum . stable haematomas detected exploration associated injuries opened. central expanding haematomas indicate injuries renal pedicle, aorta, vena cava potentially life-threatening warrant exploration . feasibility renal reconstruction judged operation. overall rate patients undergo nephrectomy exploration approximately 30% . intra-abdominal injuries also increase likelihood nephrectomy . mortality associated overall severity injury often consequence renal injury . high velocity gunshot injuries make reconstruction difficult nephrectomy usually required . renorrhaphy common reconstructive technique. partial nephrectomy required non-viable tissue detected. watertight closure collecting system desirable, although closing parenchyma injured collecting system acceptable. use haemostatic agents sealants reconstruction helpful . cases, drainage ipsilateral retroperitoneum recommended. repair vascular injuries seldom, ever, effective . repair attempted patients solitary kidney bilateral injuries . nephrectomy main artery injury outcomes similar vascular repair worsen post-treatment renal function short-term. bleeding dissection main renal artery may also managed stent.
