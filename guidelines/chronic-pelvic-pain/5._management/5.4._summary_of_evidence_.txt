Management of scrotal pain syndrome Summary of evidenceLEMicrosurgical denervation of the spermatic cord is an effective therapy for primary scrotal pain syndrome.2bVasovasostomy is effective in post-vasectomy pain.2b RecommendationsStrength ratingInform about the risk of post-vasectomy pain when counselling patients planned for vasectomy.StrongDo open instead of laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair, to reduce the risk of scrotal pain.StrongIn patients with testicular pain improving after spermatic block, offer microsurgical denervation of the spermatic cord.Weak 5.4.4. Management of primary urethral pain syndrome Summary of evidenceLEThere is no specific treatment for primary urethral pain syndrome.4 5.4.5. Management of gynaecological aspects of chronic pelvic pain Summary of evidenceLETherapeutic options, including pharmacotherapy and surgery, can treat endometriosis effectively.1bPsychological treatment (CBT or supportive psychotherapy) can improve pain and sexual and emotional function in vaginal and vulvar pain syndrome.1bMost gynaecological pain conditions (including dysmenorrhea, post-mesh insertion and gynaecological malignancy) can be treated effectively using pharmacotherapy.3All other gynaecological conditions (including obstetric injury, pelvic organ prolapse) can be treated effectively using surgery.2 RecommendationsStrength ratingInvolve a gynaecologist to provide therapeutic options such as hormonal therapy or surgery in well-defined disease states.StrongProvide a multi-disciplinary approach to pain management in persistent disease states.StrongAll patients who have developed complications after mesh insertion should be referred to a multi-disciplinary service (incorporating pain medicine and surgery).Strong 5.4.6. Management of primary anorectal pain syndrome Summary of evidenceLEBiofeedback is the preferred treatment for Chronic Primary Anal Pain Syndrome.1aElectro stimulation is less effective than biofeedback.1bAvailable evidence fails to confirm effectiveness of BTX-A in management of Chronic Primary Anal Pain Syndrome.3Percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation is effective in anal pain.3Sacral neuromodulation is effective in anal pain.3Inhaled salbutamol is effective in intermittent Chronic Primary Anal Pain Syndrome.3 RecommendationsStrength ratingUndertake biofeedback treatment in patients with chronic anal pain.StrongOffer percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation in Chronic Primary Anal Pain Syndrome.WeakOffer sacral neuromodulation in Chronic Primary Anal Pain Syndrome.WeakOffer inhaled salbutamol in intermittent Chronic Primary Anal Pain Syndrome.Weak 5.4.7. Management of pudendal neuralgia Summary of evidenceLEThere are multiple treatment options with varying levels of evidence.3 RecommendationStrength ratingNeuropathic pain guidelines are well-established.

Management of sexological aspects in chronic pelvic pain Summary of evidenceLEPelvic floor muscle physical therapy may offer relief of pain and reduction in sexual complaints.2b RecommendationsStrength ratingOffer behavioural strategies to the patient and his/her partner to reduce sexual dysfunctions.WeakOffer pelvic floor muscle therapy as part of the treatment plan to improve quality of life and sexual function.Weak 5.4.9.
