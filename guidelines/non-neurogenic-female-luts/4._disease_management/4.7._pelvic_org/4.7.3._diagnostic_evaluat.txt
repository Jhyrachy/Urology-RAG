4.7.3. Diagnostic evaluation. Pelvic organ prolapse is a clinical diagnosis and is staged according to the POP-Q system. Pelvic organ prolapse that is above the hymen should only produce mild symptoms at most [628]. In cases where there is a discrepancy between the clinical symptoms and POP-Q staging, it is advised to consider performing the POP-Q measurement in a standing rather than supine position or re-evaluating at a later time in the day. Magnetic resonance imaging assessment demonstrated a marked difference in POP staging between supine and standing position [629]. Additional diagnostic tests for POP are mainly indicated if there are accompanying symptoms like LUTS or bowel dysfunction. Imaging techniques are not advised for the routine diagnostic work-up of patients presenting with POP [66]. The role of urodynamics in the diagnostic work-up of SUI has been discussed in Section 4.2, of this guideline. The use of techniques to reduce POP during urodynamic evaluation to diagnose occult SUI is common practice. This information may be used to decide if additional anti-UI surgery should be offered at the time of POP surgery or to counsel patients on the possible after-effects of POP treatment. There are several POP reduction methods that may be used during physical examination or urodynamic evaluation. In a multicentre observational study, five different cough/stress tests were compared for their ability to detect SUI in women with POP [630]. Stress urinary incontinence during at least one of the five tests occurred in 60/205 (29.2%) women without SUI symptoms. Looking at single test performance, the detection rate of occult SUI in women without symptoms increased from 4.4% in case of no reduction to 22% in case of reduction with a pessary. A large RCT included women with POP without symptoms of SUI, who were randomised to sacro-colpopexy with or without Burch colposuspension [631]. Three hundred and twenty-two stress-continent women with stages 2–4 prolapse underwent standardised urodynamic testing, and the protocol included five prolapse reduction methods. Preoperatively, twelve of 313 (3.7%) women demonstrated urodynamic SUI without prolapse reduction. Preoperative detection of urodynamic SUI with prolapse reduction at 300 mL was by pessary, 6% (5/88); manual, 16% (19/122); forceps, 21% (21/98); swab, 20% (32/158); and speculum, 30% (35/118). Another large trial included women with POP without SUI symptoms randomised to vaginal POP surgery with or without (sham incision) MUS [632]. Before surgery, 33.5% (111/331) of women demonstrated SUI at a prolapse-reduction cough stress test. In an observational study of 172 women with POP without SUI, 19% of women were diagnosed with occult SUI by basic office evaluation (with prolapse reduction with swab on forceps) and 29% on urodynamic evaluation [633]. In summary, SUI can be demonstrated in women with POP without symptoms of SUI after POP reduction in up to 30% of cases. There is no consensus on the best reduction technique. Although the detection rate of occult SUI increases after reduction of POP in women without SUI symptoms, its clinical value is under debate. In one trial, preoperative stress-continent women were evaluated during urodynamic testing with prolapse reduction to determine if they were more likely to report postoperative SUI, regardless of concomitant colposuspension (controls 58% vs. 38% and Burch colposuspension 32% vs. 21%) [631]. In another trial, women with SUI during the cough stress test after POP reduction reported UI at three months in 29.6% in the synthetic MUS group, compared with 71.9% in the sham group [632]. Women with a positive prolapse reduction stress test before surgery appeared to receive more benefit from a synthetic MUS at three months, but not at twelve months, than did those with a negative test. In a large observational study, women did not receive additional anti-UI surgery even if they had SUI after POP reduction preoperatively. In this scenario, 9% (16/172) of women developed postoperative de novo SUI and six underwent surgery for de novo SUI [633]. Women with demonstrable preoperative SUI were more at risk of postoperative SUI: 28% vs. 5%. Based on urodynamic evaluation only, one more woman was predicted to have postoperative SUI, but all six women who underwent treatment for de novo SUI showed SUI during basic office evaluation. In a model developed to predict the risk of de novo SUI in women undergoing POP surgery based on findings from two trials, twelve preoperative predictors were tested [634]. Positive SUI during a preoperative prolapse reduction test was included in this model, but it failed to be a significant predictor as a single item. Preoperative POP stage was not associated with risk of de novo SUI. 4.7.3.1. Summary of evidence and recommendation for detection of SUI in women with POP Summary of evidenceLEPelvic organ prolapse reduction during cough stress test, in office or during urodynamics detects SUI in ~30% of continent women.2aWomen with SUI after POP reduction preoperatively (occult SUI) is likely to be at increased risk of developing SUI symptoms after POP surgery.2a RecommendationStrength ratingPerform pelvic organ prolapse (POP) reduction test in continent women to identify those with occult stress urinary incontinence and counsel them about the pros and cons of additional anti-incontinence surgery at the time of POP surgery.Strong 4.7.3.2. Urodynamics in women with pelvic organ prolapse and LUTS (without stress urinary incontinence) The role of urodynamics is less clear in women presenting with POP and concurrent LUTS, other than SUI. Pelvic organ prolapse is a complex condition incorporating different compartments of the vagina and presenting at different stages of severity. Information about detrusor activity, as assessed with urodynamics, may provide information about the risk of developing DO after surgery, but also on the risk of urinary retention due to DU. An observational study assessed predictors for DO following POP surgery for POP-Q stage 3 or higher in 1,503 women and the authors concluded that preoperative maximum urethral closure pressure > 60 cm H2O, Qmax < 15 mL/s, maximum detrusor voiding pressure (Dmax) > 20 cm H2O and PVR volume > 200 mL were independent risk factors for postoperative DO [635]. A small observational study (n = 49) evaluated patients with preoperative DU (detrusor pressure at maximum flow was < 10 cm H2O and Qmax < 12 mL/s) after POP surgery. Surgery objectively cured DU in 47% of women and urodynamic findings normalised after surgery [636]. The 2019 NICE Guidelines do not include a recommendation to perform urodynamics as part of the diagnostic work-up of POP, except for combination with symptomatic SUI [66].
