9.1.3. Epidemiology and Classification. The overall incidence of micropenis in the male population is not clearly documented. Epidemiological studies demonstrate that between 0.015% - 0.66% of male newborns have a micropenis [1166,1167]. There are concerns that the prevalence of this congenital abnormality is increasing due to in-utero exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals before and during pregnancy [1167]. Despite the limited prevalence of micropenis, there is a major demand for penile augmentation procedures worldwide. This phenomenon can be partially explained by the increased interest in pornography in recent years and the altered perception of a normal penile size [1118,1168,1169]. Due to the heterogeneity of clinical situations related to short penis conditions, a classification based on the underlying aetiology is provided below (Table 22).

False penile shortness - congenital or acquired Among causes underlying a false penile shortness, the buried penis is the only well-known condition. Historically, a buried penis has been considered a congenital disease affecting children: the so-called “concealed penis” or “webbed penis” [1170,1171]. Indeed, an abnormal development of the dartos fascia may lead to the entrapment of the penile shaft to the peri-genital tissue leading to this clinical manifestation. On the other hand, a buried penis in the adult is widely recognised as an acquired condition, termed the adult acquired buried penis (AABP) [1172]. The aetiology underlying the development of AABP is deemed to be related to a chronic inflammatory state of the penile dartos which leads to a progressive retraction and scarring of the peri-genital teguments [1173,1174]. The progressive entrapment of the phallus causes a moist environment which facilitates bacterial and fungal growth causing chronic inflammation [1175]. The ensuing fibrosis results in further entrapment of the penile shaft in the peri-genital tissue [1174,1175]. Although the exact prevalence of AABP is unknown, its incidence seems to be increasing along with the growing prevalence of obesity, which represents the main risk factor [1176]. Other factors contributing to AABP include aggressive circumcision, following surgical treatment in the obese or penile cancer (PC), or chronic dermatological conditions such as lichen sclerosis (LS) [1177-1179]. The AABP is commonly associated with erectile and voiding dysfunctions, difficulties in maintaining adequate genital hygiene and a poor QoL [1177-1179]. A summary of risk factors for AABP and underlying issues requiring surgery is detailed in Table 23.

The aim of AABP treatment is to restore the functional genital anatomy and to improve QoL [1177,1178]. So far, different authors have proposed a number of classifications for AABP based upon both clinical presentation and the surgical procedure required [1172,1191]. 9.1.3.2. Intrinsic penile shortness – congenital This category encompasses the so-called “true micropenis” [1199-1201]. Despite male genital malformations being recognised as the most common birth defects, they represent a rare clinical entity with a prevalence between 0.9% and 2.1% [1202,1203]. Normal genital development is under the influence of hormonal stimulation during the fetal and pubertal periods [1204]. Several genetic syndromes may cause disturbance of the physiological hormonal axis needed for a normal genital development [1199,1205]. Micropenis may also exist as an isolated finding without a definitive etiological cause in up to 25% of the cases. The classification of the clinical conditions associated with intrinsic penile shortness in the adult is presented in Table 24. Table 24: Classification of the clinical conditions underlying intrinsic penile shortness in the adult AetiologyDisturbsHypogonadotropic hypogonadismGenetic diseasesIatrogenic or traumatic injury to pituitary gland or hypothalamusHypergonadotropic HypogonadismChromosomal alterations (e.g., Klinefelter Syndrome)Androgen Synthesis DefectsDysgenetic gonadsSyndromic or Multiple Congenital AnomaliesBladder exstrophy–epispadias complexHypospadiasUnknown- Amongst the pre-existing clinical entities associated with micropenis, the bladder exstrophy–epispadias complex (BEEC) is the most studied [1177,1178,1201]. It represents a spectrum of genitourinary malformations ranging in severity from epispadias to bladder exstrophy or exstrophy of the cloaca. It is considered as a rare disease, with a prevalence at birth of 1/10,000 [1199,1201,1203,1206]. Even though surgical reconstruction aims to improve body image, this clinical entity is frequently burdened by psychosocial and psychosexual dysfunctions in the long term [1207-1213]. Additionally, male infertility is frequently associated due to poor sperm quantity or quality and hormonal impairment [1214]. 9.1.3.3. Intrinsic penile shortness – acquired This category includes a series of pathological entities that lead to the shortening of the corpora cavernosa. The mechanism underlying intrinsic penile shortening can be acute, as in the case of penile trauma or surgical amputation due to penile cancer or chronic due to a progressive fibrotic process involving the corpora cavernosa [1215-1217]. Traumatic genital injuries may commonly result from traffic accidents and gunshot wounds [1217]. Rarely, a penile amputation can be the result of circumcision and genital surgical procedures such as hypospadias repair, penile prosthesis implantation or urethroplasty, and may result in a decrease in penile length [1218-1222]. Among chronic causes of penile shortening, Peyronie’s disease (PD), treatments for prostate cancer, particularly radical prostatectomy (RP) and radical cystectomy represent the most common [1132,1215,1216,1223-1231]. 9.1.3.4. Body dysmorphic disorder Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is a clinical diagnosis defined by the American Psychiatric Association (APA; DSM-5) as the strong distress generated by perceived defect(s) or flaw(s) in the individual’s physical appearance. This flaw is not observable to others, or, in case it exists, it appears only slightly [1232]. This condition is followed by significant impairment in important areas of the individual’s social or occupational life. Body dysmorphic disorder has been allocated to the Obsessive Compulsive and Related Disorders section [1232]. Muscle dysmorphia is a typology within BDD characterising individuals – usually men – with a strong pre-occupation with their perceived small muscles and body shape. Sometimes, men with BDD/muscle dysmorphia also present with an exaggerated focus on the size or shape of their penis. In those cases, Penile Dysmorphic Disorder (PDD) can be used as a shorthand concept – not listed in APA’s DSM-5 coding system. Both BDD and PDD are conceptually different from small penis anxiety (SPA) or small penis syndrome, which refers to a man’s excessive anxiety regarding his normal-sized penis. Small penis anxiety is not included under APA’s nomenclature but men with SPA may be at risk for BDD [1233]. All these definitions exclude men with true micropenis [1232,1234,1235]. Prevalence data shows that 2.2% of men in the USA and 1.8% in Germany suffer from BDD [1232]. Between 3%-16% of patients undergoing cosmetic surgery are expected to present BDD, a higher rate in men (15.3%) than in women (10.9%) [1236]. These psychopathological entities must be differentiated from Gender Dysphoria, i.e., the clinical distress associated with the incongruence between gender identity and the gender assigned at birth; and from Koro, i.e., sudden anxiety about the penis falling back into the abdomen [1232].
