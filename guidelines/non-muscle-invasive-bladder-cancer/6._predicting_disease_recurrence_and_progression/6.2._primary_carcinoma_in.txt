6.2. Primary carcinoma in situ. Without any treatment, approximately 54% of patients with CIS progress to muscle-invasive disease [232] (LE: 3). There are no reliable prognostic factors, but some studies, however, have reported a worse prognosis in concurrent CIS and T1 tumours compared to primary CIS [233,234], in extended CIS [235] and in CIS in the prostatic urethra [177]. The response to intravesical treatment with BCG or chemotherapy is an important prognostic factor for subsequent progression and death caused by BC [223,224,230]. Approximately 10 to 20% of complete responders eventually experience disease progression to muscle-invasive disease, compared with 66% of non- responders [236,237].
