3.3.5.6. Prior to orthopaedic surgery. One RCT (n=471) and one multicentre cohort study (n=303) comparing the treatment of ABU with no treatment prior to orthopaedic surgery (hip arthroplasty/hemiarthroplasty or total knee arthroplasty) were identified [106,107]. Neither of the studies showed a beneficial effect of antibiotic treatment in terms of prosthetic joint infection (3.8% vs. 0% and 3.9% vs. 4.7%, respectively). The cohort study reported no significant difference in the rate of post-operative symptomatic UTI (0.65% vs. 2.7%) [107]. One further RCT investigated the efficacy of pre-operative ABU treatment with fosfomycin-trometamol for prevention of early-periprosthetic joint infections (PJI) after hip hemiarthroplasty for fractures. Asymptomatic bacteriuria was not predictive of early-PJI (OR: 1.06, 95% CI 0.33 - 3.38), and its treatment did not modify early-PJI incidence (OR: 1.03, 95% CI 0.15 - 7.10) [108]. Furthermore, four additional meta-analyses did not find a benefit for pre-operative screening or treatment of ABU prior to orthopaedic surgery [109-112]. Therefore, treatment of bacteriuria is not recommended prior to arthroplasty surgery.
