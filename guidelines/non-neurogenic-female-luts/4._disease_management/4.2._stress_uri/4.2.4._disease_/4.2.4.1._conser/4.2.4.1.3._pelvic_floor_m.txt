4.2.4.1.3. Pelvic floor muscle training. Pelvic floor muscle training is used to improve functional and morphological parameters of the pelvic floor, thus improving urethral stability. An immediate effect of a single PFM contraction is narrowing of the levator hiatus area, increase of urethral closure pressure, and lifting of the bladder and rectum thus preventing occurrence of SUI [312-314]. In an RCT comparing intensive PFMT over a six-month period with no treatment, there were increased muscle strength and endurance, narrowing of the levator hiatus, reduced PFM length, increased muscle volume, and lifting of the bladder neck and rectal ampulla [315]. Pelvic floor muscle training may be used to prevent SUI, e.g., in childbearing women before birth, or as part of a planned recovery programme after childbirth. Most often, PFMT is used to treat existing SUI; sometimes in combination with observation and/or palpation of the muscle contraction by the therapist, or biofeedback (using an apparatus measuring the contraction either by electromyography, manometry, dynamometry, US or MRI). Electrical stimulation and vaginal cones are also used in treatment of SUI based on an assumption of the same mechanism of action.
