3.4. molecular background utucs. number studies focusing molecular classification able demonstrate genetically distinct groups utuc evaluating dna, rna protein expression. common genomic alterations included fgfr3, chromatin remodelling genes (i.e., kmt2d kdm6a), tp53/mdm2, typical tumour suppressors/oncogenes cdkn2a ras . low-grade tumours enriched activating fgfr3 mutations (> 90% tumours) depleted tp53/mdm2 mutations, whereas high-grade tumours often show mutations tp53 signalling . also shown utuc t-cell depleted immune contexture activated fgfr3 signalling . five different molecular subtypes different gene expression, tumour location outcome identified, but, yet, unclear whether subtypes respond differently treatment therefore, subtypes limited use daily practice .
