7.1.4.3. Tumour ablation. 7.1.4.3.1. Role of renal mass biopsy A RMB is required prior to tumour ablation (see Sections 5.3 - Renal tumour biopsy and 5.4 - Summary of evidence and recommendations for the diagnostic assessment of RCC). Historically, up to 45% of patients underwent tumour ablation of a benign or non-diagnostic mass [388,389]. An analysis of the European multi-national prospective EuRECA registry (871 patients undergoing cryoablation) showed that the use of pre-cryoablation biopsy has significantly increased from 42% (65/156) in 2015 to 72% (88/122) in 2019 (p < 0.001), making treatment for a benign or an unknown histology significantly less likely (OR: 0.64, p < 0.001 and OR 0.31, p = 0.044, respectively) [390]. A RMB in a separate session reduces over-treatment significantly, with 80% of patients with benign lesions opting not to proceed with TA [389]. Additionally, there is some evidence that the oncological outcome following TA differs according to RCC subtype which should therefore be factored into the decision-making process. In a series of 229 patients with cT1a tumours (mean size 2.5 cm) treated with RFA, the 5-year DFS rate was 90% for ccRCC and 100% for pRCC (80 months: 100% vs. 87%, p = 0.04) [391].In another series, the total tumour ablation effectiveness rate was 90.9% for ccRCC and 100% for pRCC [392].A study comparing RFA with surgery suggested worse outcomes of RFA vs. PN in cT1b ccRCC, while no difference was seen in those with non-ccRCC [393]. Furthermore, patients with high-grade RCC or metastasis may choose different treatments over tumour ablation. Finally, patients without biopsy or a non-diagnostic biopsy are often assumed to have RCC and will undergo potentially unnecessary radiological follow-up or further treatment. 7.1.4.3.2. Cryoablation Cryoablation is performed using either a percutaneous- or a laparoscopic-assisted approach, with technical success rates of > 95% [394]. In comparative studies, there was no significant difference in the overall complication rates between laparoscopic- and percutaneous cryoablation [395-397]. One comparative study reported similar OS, CSS, and RFS in 145 laparoscopic patients with a longer follow-up vs. 118 patients treated percutaneously with a shorter follow-up [396]. A shorter average length of hospital stay was found with the percutaneous technique [396-398]. A SR including 82 articles reported complication rates ranging between 8-20% with most complications being minor [399]. Although a precise definition of tumour recurrence is lacking, the athors reported a lower RFS as compared to that of PN. Oncological outcomes after cryoablation have generally been favourable for cT1a tumours. In a recently published series of 308 patients with cT1a and cT1b tumours undergoing percutaneous cryoablation, local recurrence was seen in 7.7% of cT1a tumours vs. 34.5% of cT1b tumours. On multivariable regression, the risk of disease progression increased by 32% with each 1 cm increase in tumour size (HR: 1.32, p < 0.001). Mean decline in eGFR was 11.7 mL/min/1.73 m2 [400]. In another large series of 220 patients with biopsy-proven cT1 RCC, five-year local RFS was 93.9%, while metastasis-free survival approached 94.4% [394]. A series of 134 patients with T1 RCC (median tumour size 2.8 cm) submitted to percutaneous cryoablation yielded a ten-year DSF of 94% [401]. For cT1b tumours, local tumour control rates drop significantly. One study showed local tumour control in only 60.3% at three years [402]. In another series, the PFS rate was 66.7% at twelve months [403]. Furthermore, recent analyses demonstrated five-year cancer-specific mortality rates of 7.6-9% [404,405]. On multivariable analysis, cryoablation of cT1b tumours was associated a 2.5-fold increased risk of death from RCC compared with PN [404] Recurrence after initial cryoablation is often managed with re-cryoablation, but only 45% of patients remain disease-free at two years [406]. 7.1.4.3.3. Radiofrequency ablation Radiofrequency ablation is performed laparoscopically or percutaneously. Several studies compared patients with cT1a tumours treated by laparoscopic or percutaneous RFA [407-410]. Complications occurred in up to 29% of patients but were mostly minor. Complication rates, recurrence rates and CSS were similar in patients treated laparoscopically and percutaneously. The initial technical success rate on early (i.e., one month) imaging after one session of RFA is 94% for cT1a and 81% for cT1b tumours [411]. This is generally managed by re-RFA, approaching overall total technical success rates > 95% with one or more sessions [412]. Long-term outcomes with over five years of follow-up following RFA have been reported. In recent studies, the five-year OS rate was 73–79% [411,412], due to patient selection. While oncological outcomes have been favourable for cT1a tumours, it’s important to note that within the T1a 3-4cm subpopulation, these outcomes are less encouraging [413]. A study involving 106 patients treated with radiofrequency ablation, and with a median follow-up of 79 months, the ten-year DFS rate was 82%, but a notable decline was observed to 68% for tumours larger than 3 cm [412]. In series focusing on clinical T1b tumours (4.1–7.0 cm), the five-year DFS rate was 74.5% to 81% [411,414]. Oncological outcomes appear to be worse than after surgery, but comparative data are severely biased (see Section 7.1.4.3.4). In general, most disease recurrences occur locally and recurrences beyond five years are rare [412,414]. 7.1.4.3.4. Microwave ablation The best evidence base for these techniques exists for percutaneous microwave ablation. In a study of 185 patients with a median follow-up of 40 months, the five-year local progression rate was 3.2%, while 4.3% developed distant metastases [415]. Results appear to be favourable for cT1b tumours as well [416]. Overall, current data on cryoablation, RFA and microwave ablation of cT1a renal tumours indicate short-term equivalence with regards to complications, oncological and renal functional outcomes [417,418]. 7.1.4.3.5. Tumour ablation versus surgery The Guideline Panel performed a protocol-driven SR of comparative studies (including > 50 patients) of TA with PN for T1N0M0 renal masses [419]. Twenty-six non-randomised comparative studies published between 2000 and 2019 were included, recruiting a total of 16,780 patients. Four studies compared laparoscopic TA vs. laparoscopic/robotic PN; sixteen studies compared laparoscopic or percutaneous TA vs. open-, laparoscopic- or robotic PN; two studies compared different techniques of TA and four studies compared TA vs. PN vs. RN. In this SR, TA as treatment for T1 renal masses was found to be safe in terms of complications and adverse events (AEs), but its long-term oncological effectiveness compared with PN remained unclear. The primary reason for the persisting uncertainty was related to the nature of the available data; most studies were retrospective observational studies with poorly matched controls, or single- arm case series with short follow-up. Many studies were poorly described and lacked a clear comparator. There was also considerable methodological heterogeneity. Another major limitation was the absence of clearly defined primary outcome measures. Even when a clear endpoint such as OS was reported, data were difficult to interpret because of the varying length and type of follow-up amongst studies. The Panel also appraised the published SRs based on the AMSTAR 2 tool which showed “Critically Low” or “Low” ratings [419]. Tumour ablation has been demonstrated to be associated with good long-term survival in several single-arm non-comparative studies [420,421]. Due to the lack of controls, this apparent benefit is subject to significant uncertainties. Whether such benefit is due to the favourable natural history of such tumours or due to the therapeutic efficacy of TA, as compared to PN, remains unknown. In addition, there are data from comparative studies suggesting TA may be associated with worse oncological outcomes in terms of local recurrence and metastatic progression and CSM [279,404,405,422-424]. However, there appears to be no clinically significant difference in five-year CSM between TA and AS [372]. A retrosepctive multicentre study, including 86 partial nephrectomies and 104 TA, matched for complexities, has shown that PN and cryoablation are comparable regarding complications within 90 days after treatment [425]. The Panel concluded that the current data are inadequate to reach conclusions regarding the clinical effectiveness of TA as compared with PN. Given these uncertainties in the presence of only low-quality evidence, TA can only be recommended to frail and/or comorbid patients with SRMs. 7.1.4.3.6. Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) has been emerging as a treatment option for medically inoperable patients with localised cT1a and cT1b tumours [426,427]. A variety of dose-fractionation schedules have been reported (26-60Gy; single, three and five fractions) [427]. Published single-arm studies, mainly including cT1 RCC, with a median follow-up range of 16.4-34.3 months, reported local control rates of 90-97.2% [427-434]. However, viable tumour cells are often seen in post-SABR biopsies, although their clinical significance remains unclear [430]. Grade 3 or 4 toxicities were reported in 0-9.1% of the patients across studies [427]. Even though early reported results of SABR look encouraging, more evidence from well conducted prospective studies with longer follow-up is needed. 7.1.4.3.7. Other ablative techniques Some studies have shown the feasibility of other ablative techniques, such as high-intensity focused US ablation and non-thermal irreversible electroporation. However, these techniques are still considered experimental. 7.1.4.3.8. Summary of evidence and recommendations for therapeutic approaches as alternative to surgery Summary of evidenceLEMost population-based analyses show a significantly lower CSM for patients treated with surgery compared to non-surgical management.3In AS cohorts, the growth of SRMs is low in most cases and progression to metastatic disease is rare (1–2%).3Low quality studies suggest higher disease recurrence rates after RFA of tumours > 3 cm and after cryoablation of tumours > 4 cm.3Low quality studies suggest a higher local recurrence rate for TA therapies compared to PN, but quality of data does not allow definitive conclusions.3 RecommendationsStrength ratingOffer active surveillance (AS) or tumour ablation (TA) to frail and/or comorbid patients with small renal masses.WeakPerform a percutaneous renal mass biopsy prior to, and not concomitantly with, TA.StrongWhen TA or AS are offered, discuss with patients about the harms/benefits with regards to oncological outcomes and complications.StrongDo not routinely offer TA for tumours > 3 cm and cryoablation for tumours > 4 cm.Weak
