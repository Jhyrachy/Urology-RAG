4.5. histological grading non-muscle-invasive bladder urothelial carcinomas. 4.5.1. types histological grading systems 2004 published histological classification system ucs including papillary urothelial neoplasm low malignant potential (punlmp), non-invasive papillary carcinoma low grade (lg) hg. system also taken updated 2016/2022 classifications . provides different patient stratification individual categories compared older 1973 classification, distinguished grade 1 (g1), grade 2 (g2) grade 3 (g3) categories . significant shift patients categories 1973 2004/2022 systems (see figure 4.1), example increase number hg patients (who 2004/2022) due inclusion subset g2 patients favourable prognosis compared g3 category (who 1973) . according multi-institutional individual patient data analysis, proportion tumours classified punlmp (who 2004/2016) decreased low levels last decade . 4.5.2. prognostic value histological grading systematic review meta-analysis show 2004/2016 classification outperforms 1973 classification prediction recurrence progression . compare prognostic value classifications, individual patient data analysis 5,145 primary tat1 nmibc patients sixteen centres throughout europe one canada conducted. patients transurethral resection bladder tumour (turbt) followed intravesical instillations physician’s discretion. large study, 1973 2004/2016 prognostic progression recurrence. compared, 1973 stronger prognosticator progression tat1 nmibc 2004/2016. however, 3-tier (lg/g1-g2, hg/g2 & hg/g3) 4-tier hybrid combination lg/g1, lg/g2, hg/g2 hg/g3) classification systems proved superior either classification system alone, divides large group g2 patients two subgroups (lg/hg) different prognoses . subgroup 3,311 patients primary ta bladder tumours, similar prognosis found punlmp ta lg carcinomas . 4.5.3. clinical application histological grading systems 2004/2022 classification system currently supported clinical application. nevertheless, 1973 still used.the important parameters, must considered clinical application grading system inter-observer reproducibility prognostic value (see sections 4.5.1 4.6).these guidelines provide recommendations tumours classified classification systems. figure 4.1: schematic representation tumours according grade 1973 2004/2022 classifications **grade shifts 1973 (g1–g3) 2004/2022 (punlmp, lg hg) classification ta/t1 bladder tumours displayed dotted lines arrows. along dotted lines, degree anaplasia 5-year progression rates increased lg/g1, lg/g2, hg/g2, hg/g3 patients. note: 2004/2022 classification updated version 2004/2016 classification. according series 5145 primary ta-t1 patients, distribution g1, g2 g3 1973 classification 23.5, 49.3 27.2% respectively corresponding punlmp, lg hg rates 2004/2022 system 1.5, 49.8 48,7% respectively . figure reproduced permission elsevier .
