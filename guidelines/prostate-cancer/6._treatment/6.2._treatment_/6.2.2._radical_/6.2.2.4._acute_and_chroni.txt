6.2.2.4. Acute and chronic complications of radical prostatectomy. Post-operative incontinence and ED are common problems following surgery for PCa. A key consideration is whether these problems are reduced by using newer techniques such as RALP. Systematic reviews have documented complication rates after RALP [612-616], and can be compared with contemporaneous reports after radical retropubic prostatectomy (RRP) [617]. A prospective controlled non-RCT of patients undergoing RP in 14 centres using RALP or RRP showed that twelve months after RALP, 21.3% of patients were incontinent, as were 20.2% after RRP (adjusted OR: 1.08, 95% CI: 0.87–1.34) [618]. Erectile dysfunction was observed in 70.4% after RALP and 74.7% after RRP. The adjusted OR was 0.81 (95% CI: 0.66–0.98) [618]. A SR and meta-analysis of unplanned hospital visits and re-admissions post-RP analysed 60 studies with over 400,000 patients over a 20-year period up to 2020. It found an emergency room visit rate of 12% and a hospital re-admission rate of 4% at 30 days post-operatively [619]. A RCT comparing RALP and RRP reported outcomes at 12 weeks in 326 patients and functional outcomes at two years [620]. Urinary function scores did not differ significantly between RRP vs. RALP at 6 and 12 weeks post-surgery (74–50 vs. 71–10, p = 0.09; 83–80 vs. 82–50, p = 0.48), with comparable outcomes for sexual function scores (30–70 vs. 32–70, p = 0.45; 35–00 vs. 38–90, p = 0.18). In the RRP group 14 (9%) patients had post-operative complications vs. 6 (4%) in the RALP group. The intra- and peri-operative complications of RRP and RALP are listed in Table 6.1.4. Table 6.1.5 lists the Clavien-Dindo definition of surgical complications. The early use of phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitors in penile rehabilitation remains controversial resulting in a lack of clear recommendations (see Section 8.3.2.1).

Effect of anterior and posterior reconstruction on continence Preservation of integrity of the external urethral sphincter is critical for continence post-RP. Less clear is the effect of reconstruction of surrounding support structures to return to continence. Several small RCTs have been conducted, however, pooling analyses is hampered by variation in the definitions of incontinence and surgical approach, such as open vs. robotic and intra-peritoneal vs. extra-peritoneal. In addition, techniques used to perform both anterior suspension or reconstruction and posterior reconstruction are varied. For example, anterior suspension is performed either through periosteum of the pubis or the combination of ligated DVC and puboprostatic ligaments (PPL). Posterior reconstruction from rhabdosphincter is described to either Denonvilliers fascia posterior to bladder or to posterior bladder wall itself. Two trials assessing posterior reconstruction in RALRP found no significant improvement in return to continence [622,623]. A third trial using posterior bladder wall for reconstruction showed only an earlier return to 1 pad per day (median 18 vs. 30 days, p = 0.024) [624]. When combining both anterior and posterior reconstruction, where for anterior reconstruction the PPL were sutured to the anterior bladder neck, another RCT found no improvement compared to a standard anastomosis with no reconstruction [625]. Four RCTs including anterior suspension have also shown conflicting results. Anterior suspension alone through the pubic periosteum, in the setting of extra-peritoneal RALRP, showed no advantage [626]. However, when combined with posterior reconstruction in RRP, one RCT showed significant improvement in return to continence at one month (7.1% vs. 26.5%, p = 0.047) and three months (15.4% vs. 45.2%, p = 0.016), but not at six months (57.9% vs. 65.4%, p = 0.609) [627]. Another anterior plus posterior reconstruction RCT using the Advanced Reconstruction of VesicoUrethral Support (ARVUS) technique and the strict definition of continence of ‘no pads‘, showed statistically significant improvement in continence at 2 weeks (43.8% vs. 11.8%), 4 weeks (62.5% vs. 14.7%), 8 weeks (68.8% vs. 20.6%), six months (75% vs. 44.1%) and twelve months (86.7% vs. 61.3%), when compared to standard posterior Rocco reconstruction [628]. Anterior suspension alone through the DVC and PPL combined without posterior construction in the setting of RRP has shown improvement in continence at one month (20% vs. 53%, p = 0.029), three months (47% vs. 73%, p = 0.034) and six months (83% vs. 100%, p = 0.02), but not at twelve months (97% vs. 100%, p = 0.313) [629]. Together, these results suggest a possible earlier return to continence, but no long-term difference. As there is conflicting evidence on the effect of anterior and/or posterior reconstruction on return to continence post-RP, no recommendations can be made. However, no studies showed an increase in adverse oncologic outcome or complications with reconstruction. 6.2.2.4.2. Deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis For EAU Guidelines recommendations on post-RP deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis, please see the Thromboprophylaxis Guidelines Section 3.1.6 [630]. However, these recommendations should be adapted based on national recommendations, when available. 6.2.2.4.3. Complications of extended pelvic lymph node dissection Extended PLND increases morbidity in the treatment of PCa [540]. Overall complication rates of 19.8% vs. 8.2% were noted for ePLND vs. limited PLND, respectively, with lymphoceles (10.3% vs. 4.6%) being the most common adverse event (AE). Other authors have reported lower complication rates [631]. Briganti et al., [632] also showed more complications after extended compared to limited PLND. Twenty percent of men suffer a complication of some sort after ePLND. Thromboembolic events occur in less than 1% of cases overall, but the RR of DVT and PE associated with PLND has been found to be 7.8 and 6.3, respectively [633].
