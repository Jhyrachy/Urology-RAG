6.5. Painful Ejaculation. 6.5.1. Definition and classification Painful ejaculation is a condition in which a patient feels mild discomfort to severe pain during or after ejaculation. The pain can involve the penis, scrotum, and perineum [754]. 6.5.2. Pathophysiology and risk factors Many medical conditions can result in painful ejaculation, but it can also be an idiopathic problem. Initial reports demonstrated possible associations of painful ejaculation with calculi in the seminal vesicles [755], sexual neurasthenia [756], sexually transmitted diseases (STIs) [754,757], inflammation of the prostate [228,758], PCa [759,760], BPH [226], prostate surgery [761,762], pelvic radiation [763], herniorrhaphy [764] and antidepressants [765-767]. Further case reports have suggested that mercury toxicity or Ciguatera toxin fish poisoning may also result in painful ejaculation [768,769]. Psychological issues may also be the cause of painful ejaculation, especially if the patient does not experience this problem during masturbation [770]. 6.5.3. Investigation and treatment Treating painful ejaculation must be tailored to the underlying cause if detected. Psychotherapy or relationship counselling, withdrawal of suspected agents (drugs, toxins, or radiation) [765,766,771] or the prescription of appropriate medical treatment (antibiotics, Î±-blockers or anti-inflammatory agents) may ameliorate painful ejaculation. Behavioural therapy, muscle relaxants, antidepressant treatment, anticonvulsant drugs and/or opioids, and pelvic floor exercises, may be implemented if no underlying cause can be identified [772,773]. 6.5.3.1. Surgical intervention If medical treatments fail, surgical operations such as TURP, transurethral resection of the ejaculatory duct (TURED) and neurolysis of the pudendal nerve have been suggested [774,775]. However, there is no strong supporting evidence that surgical therapy improves painful ejaculation: therefore, it must be used with caution.
