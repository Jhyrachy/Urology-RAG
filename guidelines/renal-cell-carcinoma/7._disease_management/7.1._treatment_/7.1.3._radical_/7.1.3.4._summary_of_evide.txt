7.1.3.4. Summary of evidence and recommendations for radical and partial nephrectomy techniques. Summary of evidenceLELaparoscopic RN has lower morbidity than open nephrectomy.1bShort-term oncological outcomes for T1-T2a tumours are equivalent for laparoscopic- and open RN.2aPartial nephrectomy can be performed, either by open-, pure laparoscopic- or robot-assisted approach, based on surgeonâ€™s expertise and skills.2bRobot-assisted and laparoscopic PN are associated with shorter length of hospital stay and lower blood loss compared to open PN.2bTransperitoneal and retroperitoneal laparoscopic PN do not differ in post-operative surgical and medical complications, PSMs, and kidney function.2aHospital volume for PN might impact on surgical complications, warm ischaemia time and surgical margins.3Immediate completion nephrectomy for PSMs can result in over-treatment in many cases.3Off-clamp partial nephrectomy does not improve renal function outcomes in patients with baseline normal renal function.1b RecommendationsStrength ratingOffer laparoscopic or robotic radical nephrectomy (RN) to patients with T2 tumours and localised masses not treatable by partial nephrectomy (PN).StrongDo not perform minimally invasive RN in patients with T1 tumours for whom a PN is feasible by any approach, including open.StrongDo not perform minimally invasive surgery if this approach may compromise oncological-functional- and peri-operative outcomes.StrongIntensify follow-up in patients with a positive surgical margin, especially in upstaged pT3a patients.WeakDo not attempt off-clamp partial nephrectomy unless indicated.Weak
