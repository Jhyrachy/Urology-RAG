3.1.7.5. Transplant renal artery stenosis.. The incidence of transplant renal artery stenosis is 1-25% [189,190]. Risk factors include small calibre and atherosclerosis of the donor artery, trauma to donor artery at procurement, absence of arterial patch, suturing technique (interrupted vs. continuous), and damage to the iliac artery during transplantation [191,192]. It is more common at the site of the anastomosis [191,192]. It can be suspected in case of arterial hypertension refractory to medical treatment and/or an increase in serum creatinine without hydronephrosis or urinary infection (30). The diagnosis is performed by US-colour-Doppler, showing a peak systolic velocity (PSV) of > 200 cm/s in the graft renal artery [191]. In cases of doubt a magnetic resonance angiogram or a CT angiogram can be performed [193]. It is important to determine whether the stenosis is haemodynamically significant or not. Usually, a stenosis of over 50% is considered a risk for kidney impairment [194]. In case of mild stenosis (< 50%) and absence of symptoms with no deterioration of the allograft, the management is normally conservative; although, a strict follow-up with US-colour-Doppler and clinical parameters has to be adopted due to the possible risk of graft failure [191]. In cases of clinically significant stenosis and/or > 50% on US-colour-Doppler, a confirmatory angiogram should be performed. If confirmed and a decision to treat is taken, treatments include percutaneous transluminal angioplasty/stent or surgical intervention. Interventional radiology is typically the first choice although patients considered unsuitable for radiological angioplasty due to recent transplant, multiple, long and narrow stenosis, or after failure of angioplasty may benefit from surgical treatment [191,192]. Summary of evidenceLESuspect transplant renal artery stenosis in case of refractory arterial hypertension and/or increasing serum creatinine without hydronephrosis/infections.3The diagnosis for transplant renal artery stenosis is by US-colour-Doppler, showing a peak systolic velocity (PSV) of > 200 cm/s in the graft renal artery.2aInterventional radiology is the first-line treatment option for transplant renal artery stenosis; however, in patients considered unsuitable for radiological angioplasty surgical treatment may be considered.3 RecommendationsStrength ratingPerform ultrasound-colour-Doppler to diagnose an arterial stenosis, in case of undetermined results on ultrasound consider a magnetic resonance or computed tomography angiogram.StrongPerform percutaneous transluminal angioplasty/stent, if feasible, as first-line treatment for an arterial stenosis.StrongOffer surgical treatment in case of recent transplant, multiple, long and narrow stenosis, or after failure of angioplasty.Strong
