5.2.3. Prostate-specific antigen density. Prostate-specific antigen density (PSA-D) is the level of serum PSA divided by the prostate volume. The higher the PSA-D, the more likely it is that the PCa is clinically significant; in particular in smaller prostates when a PSA-D cut-off of 0.15 ng/mL/cc was applied [195]. Several studies found a PSA-D over 0.1â€“0.15 ng/mL/cc predictive of PCa [173,174]. Patients with a PSA-D below 0.09 ng/mL/cc were found unlikely (4%) to be diagnosed with csPCa [175]. PSA-D is one of the strongest predictors in risk calculators. PSA-D remains currently limited due to the lack of standardisation of prostate volume estimation that can be assessed by DRE or by imaging (TRUS or MRI using various techniques such as ellipsoid formula or planimetry). Nonetheless, one study involving seven radiologists who assessed prostate volume on 40 MRI scans using two different ellipsoid methods and a manual planimetry method suggested that intra and inter-reader reproducibility of the three methods were excellent with intraclass correlation coefficient > 0.90 [176]. In a series of 640 men, TRUS found prostate volumes on average 8% smaller than MRI; in the 109 men who underwent RP, MRI-derived prostate volume was better correlated to the volume of the surgical specimen than TRUS-derived volume [177]. Transabdominal ultrasound overestimated the prostate volume by 9.9 ml [178]. Therefore, the use of transabdominal ultrasound to evaluate prostate volume is discouraged.
