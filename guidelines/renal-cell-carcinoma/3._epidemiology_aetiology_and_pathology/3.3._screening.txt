3.3. Screening. Despite a growing interest from both patients and clinicians in RCC screening programmes, there is a relative lack of studies reporting the efficacy, cost-effectiveness, and optimal modality for RCC screening. Urinary dipstick is an inadequate screening tool due to low sensitivity and specificity. Also incidence of RCC with non-visible haematuria is low; 0.58% [17]. No clinically validated urinary or serum biomarkers have as yet been identified. Computed tomography cannot be recommended due to cost, radiation dose and the increased potential for other incidental findings. Ultrasound (US) could be used and has acceptable sensitivity and specificity, although it is tumour size and operator dependant. Major barriers to population screening include the relatively low prevalence of the disease, the potential for false positives and over-diagnosis of slow-growing kidney tumours. Targeting high-risk individuals and/or combining detection of RCC with other routine health screenings may represent pragmatic options to improve the cost-effectiveness and reduce the potential harms of RCC screening [18-20]. Targeting of high-risk patient groups e.g., those with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) which is associated with a 10-fold increased risk of developing RCC may also be a valid approach (see Section 3.5.2) [21]. There is currently no evidence to support primary screening in the general population. 3.3.1.
