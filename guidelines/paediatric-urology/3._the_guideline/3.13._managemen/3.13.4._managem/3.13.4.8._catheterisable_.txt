3.13.4.8. Catheterisable cutaneous channel. In most patients with a neurogenic bladder CIC is required. If this is not possible, or very time and/or resource consuming via the urethra, a continent cutaneous catheterisable channel should be offered as well as in those with bladder outlet procedures. It is especially beneficial to wheelchair-bound patients who often have difficulty with urethral catheterisation or are dependent on others to catheterise the bladder. In long-term studies the revision rate due to stenosis or incontinence can be as high as 50-60% depending on the type of channel [872,873]. The stoma can be placed at the umbilicus or in the lower right abdominal wall using a VQZ plasty [874]. It should be carefully evaluated pre-operatively: it is extremely important that the patient can reach the stoma easily. Sometimes it has to be placed in the upper abdominal wall due to sever scoliosis mostly associated with obesity.
