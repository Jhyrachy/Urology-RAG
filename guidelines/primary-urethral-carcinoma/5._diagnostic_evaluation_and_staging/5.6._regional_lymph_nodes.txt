5.6. Regional lymph nodes. In urethral carcinoma enlarged LNs often represent metastatic disease (~84% of patients) [51-53], which is in contrast to penile cancer where this is the case in ~41% of patients [54]. In men, lymphatics from the anterior urethra drain into the superficial- and deep inguinal LNs and, subsequently, to the pelvic (external, obturator and internal iliac) LNs. Conversely, lymphatic vessels of the posterior urethra drain into the pelvic LNs. In women, the lymph of the proximal third drains into the pelvic LN chains, whereas the distal two-thirds initially drain into the superficial- and deep inguinal nodes [55,56].
