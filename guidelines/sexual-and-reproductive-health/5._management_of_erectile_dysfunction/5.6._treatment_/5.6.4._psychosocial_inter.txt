5.6.4. Psychosocial intervention and therapy. Psychosocial interventions including different modalities (e.g., sexual skills training, marital therapy, psychosexual education) [341], and Cognitive and Behavioural Therapy (CBT - group or couple format), are recommended [336]. Cognitive and Behaviour Therapy is aimed at altering dysfunctional cognitive and behavioural patterns influencing ED, and increasing adjustment during the course of the disorder. The CBT approach combined with medical treatment for ED has received empirical support and is considered an optimal procedure [410].
