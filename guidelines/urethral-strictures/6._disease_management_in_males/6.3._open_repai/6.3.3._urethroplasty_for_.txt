6.3.3. Urethroplasty for penobulbar or panurethral strictures. The possibilities for reconstruction are various and often include combinations of different techniques or grafts other than OMG. The patency rates are usually lower than in shorter reconstructions (Table 6.7). Hussein et al., [355] performed a RCT comparing skin grafts vs. skin flaps in strictures of mean length 15 cm and found no difference in patency rates (72% vs. 79%) or complications. Warner et al., [305] performed a multi-institutional review in 2015 including 466 patients with stricture length > 8 cm and found an overall patency rate of 77.5%. As discussed previously, Kozinn et al., [257] reported on the outcome of staged urethroplasty in a cohort of which 54.9% had panurethral strictures (Table 6.7). Kulkarni et al., [356] proposed a one-stage completely perineal approach with invagination of the penis and one-sided urethral dissection. After 59 months the overall patency rate was 83.7% in 117 men with a mean stricture length of 14 cm. Another option in patients refusing or unfit for complex reconstructive surgery is PU (see section 6.3.4 Perineal urethrostomy).
