4.9. Uroflowmetry. Urinary flow rate assessment is a widely used non-invasive urodynamic test. Key parameters are Qmax, voided volume, PVR, and flow pattern. Uroflowmetry parameters should preferably be evaluated with voided volume > 150 mL. As Qmax is prone to within-subject variation [86,87], it is useful to repeat uroflowmetry measurements, especially if the voided volume is < 150 mL, or Qmax or flow pattern is abnormal. The diagnostic accuracy of uroflowmetry for detecting BOO varies considerably and is substantially influenced by threshold values. A threshold Qmax of 10 mL/s has a specificity of 70%, a PPV of 70% and a sensitivity of 47% for BOO. The specificity using a threshold Qmax of 15 mL/s was 38%, the PPV 67% and the sensitivity 82% [88]. If Qmax is > 15 mL/s, physiological compensatory processes mean that BOO cannot be excluded. Low Qmax can arise as a consequence of BOO [89], DU or an under-filled bladder [90]. Therefore, it is limited as a diagnostic test as it is unable to discriminate between the underlying mechanisms. Uroflowmetry can be used for monitoring treatment outcomes [91] and correlating symptoms with objective findings [88,92]. Recently, a deep learning system for sound-based prediction of urinary flow has been proposed, as a simple home-based alternative to uroflowmetry, with acceptable correlation to conventional test [93]. Summary of evidenceLEThe diagnostic accuracy of uroflowmetry for detecting BOO varies considerably and is substantially influenced by threshold values. Specificity can be improved by repeated flow rate testing.2b RecommendationsStrength ratingPerform uroflowmetry in the initial assessment of male LUTS.WeakPerform uroflowmetry prior to medical or invasive treatment.Strong
