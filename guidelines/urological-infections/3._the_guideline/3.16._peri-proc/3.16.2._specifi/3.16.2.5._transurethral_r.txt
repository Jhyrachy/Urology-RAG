3.16.2.5. Transurethral resection of the bladder. One systematic review which included seven trials with a total of 1,725 participants was identified [549]. Antimicrobial prophylaxis showed no significant effect on post-operative UTIs [OR (95% CI) 1.55 (0.73 - 3.31)] and asymptomatic bacteriuria [OR (95% CI) 0.43 (0.18 â€“ 1.04)] [549]. The review did not attempt sub-group analysis according to presence of risk factors for post-operative infection such as tumour size. Risk factors for development of post-operative UTIs were evaluated only by three of the included studies and most of the parameters were analysed by no more than one study. A RCT (n=100) comparing oral fosfomycin 3g (the night before surgery) vs. intravenous cefoxitin 2g (30 min pre- and 24 hrs post-surgery) on post-operative UTIs found that a single oral administration of fosfomycin was non-inferior to intravenous administration of cefoxitin in the prevention of post-TURB UTI, even in patients considered at higher risk [550]. Panel discussion concluded that a weak recommendation to use antibiotic prophylaxis for patients undergoing TURB who had a high risk of suffering post-operative sepsis would be appropriate.
