related symptoms determination severity pain associated symptoms, progression treatment response assessed means reliable validated symptom-scoring instrument. subjective outcome measures recommended basic evaluation therapeutic monitoring patients. pain always assessed presentation (see below) identify progression treatment response. well clinic, patient keep daily record (pain diary). may need include relevant variables voiding, sexual activity, activity levels, analgesic use. increased attention patient reported outcomes gives prominence patients’ views disease pain diaries, patients’ environments, improve data quality. quality life also measured poor compared chronic diseases . study pain, pain-contingent rest, urinary symptoms associated greater disability (also measured

methods are: five point verbal scale: none, mild, moderate, severe, severe pain;a vas score one ten;an eleven point numerical scale (as below). pain assessment ratings independent cognitive emotional

ultrasound avoids form radiation, whereas ct guidance involves significant amount radiation. well injecting around pudendal nerve, specific blocks nerves arising pelvis may performed. electrophysiological studies may reveal signs perineal denervation, increased pudendal nerve latency, impaired bulbocavernosus reflex . however, abnormality detected, significant nerve damage probably
