10.1.4. Summary of evidence and recommendations for treatment of ischaemic priapism. Summary of evidenceLEIschaemic priapism is a medical emergency and immediate intervention is mandatory.2bErectile function preservation is directly related to the duration of ischaemic priapism, age andpre-operative erectile status.2bMedical treatment is variably effective in case of priapism lasting less than 48 hours.2bAspiration ± irrigation with 0.9% results in over 80% success rate when combined with intracavernous injection of sympathomimetic drugs.2bPhenylephrine is the recommended drug due to its favourable safety profile in the cardiovascular system compared to other drugs. Phenylephrine is usually diluted in normal saline with a concentration of 100-500 μg/mL and given in 200 μg doses every three to five minutes directly into the corpus cavernosum. Maximum dosage is 1 mg within one hour. Patient monitoring is highly recommended.2bOral terbutaline has a success rate in up to 60% of cases when priapism is associated with intracavernous injection of erectogenic agents.1bExchange transfusion in patients with priapism associated with SCD may result in serious neurological sequelae.2bShunt procedures are effective to resolve priapism and provide pain relief. No clear recommendation of the superiority of one type of shunt over another can be given. Distal shunts are less invasive and associated with lower rate of erectile dysfunction.2bPeri- and post-operative anticoagulant prophylaxis (325 mg acetylsalicylic acid pre-operatively, 5,000 IU heparin intra-operatively and 81 mg acetylsalicylic acid and 75 mg clopidogrel five days post-operatively) may prevent priapism recurrence.3Erectile dysfunction is almost inevitable in prolonged cases or ischaemic priapism. Early implantation of penile prosthesis is associated with lower infection rates and complications compared to late implantation.2b RecommendationsStrength ratingStart management of ischaemic priapism as early as possible (within four to six hours) and follow a stepwise approach.StrongDecompress the corpus cavernosum by penile aspiration and washout until fresh red blood is obtained as first treatment step.StrongReplace blood aspiration with intracavernous injection of a sympathomimetic drug as the first step in priapism secondary to intracavernous injections of vasoactive agents.StrongPerform intracavernous injection of a sympathomimetic drug in priapism that persists despite aspiration.StrongRepeat aspiration and intracavernous injection of a sympathomimetic drug in cases that persist despite prior aspiration and intracavernous injection of a sympathomimetic drug, before considering surgical intervention.StrongTreat ischaemic priapism associated with sickle cell disease in the same fashion as idiopathic ischaemic priapism. Do not use exchange transfusion as a primary treatment. Provide other supportive measures (intravenous hydration, oxygen administration with alkalisation with bicarbonate, blood exchange transfusions), but do not delay initial treatment to the penis.StrongProceed to surgical treatment only when blood aspiration and intracavernous injection of sympathomimetic drugs have failed.StrongPerform distal shunt surgical procedures first and combine them with tunnelling if necessary.WeakUse proximal procedures in cases of distal shunt failure (< 48 hours) or in patients who do not wish to proceed with immediate penile implant insertion.WeakDiscuss implantation of a penile prosthesis in cases of delayed presentation (> 48 hours) and in cases refractory to injection therapy and distal shunting.WeakDelay implantation of a penile prosthesis if a shunt has been performed, to minimise the risk of infection and erosion of the implant.StrongDecide on which type of implant to insert based on:patient suitability;surgeons’ experience; andavailability and cost of equipment.If a malleable penile prosthesis is implanted it can be exchanged later for an inflatable penile implant.Strong
