8.2.3.2.2. Tunical lengthening procedures. Tunical lengthening procedures are performed on the concave side of the penis after making an incision or partial excision of the plaque, with coverage of the defect with a graft. Although tunical lengthening procedures rarely lead to long-term penile length gain, they aim to minimise penile shortening caused by plication of the tunica albuginea, and correct complex deformities. In practice, tunical lengthening procedures are often combined with penile plication or shortening procedures to correct residual curvature and therefore may also result in penile shortening [1010]. Tunical lengthening surgery is preferable in patients with significant penile shortening, severe curvature and/or complex deformities (hourglass or hinge) but without underlying ED. The definition of severe curvature has been proposed to be > 60o, although no studies have validated this threshold. On the concave side of the penis, at the point of maximum curvature, which usually coincides with the location of the plaque, an incision is made, creating a defect in the albuginea that is covered with a graft. Complete plaque removal or plaque excision may be associated with higher rates of post-operative ED due to venous leak, but partial excision in cases of florid calcification may be permissible [1011,1012]. Patients who do not have pre-operative ED should be informed of the significant risk of post-operative ED of up to 50% [969]. A large number of different grafts have been used. The ideal graft should be resistant to traction, easy to suture and manipulate, flexible (although not too much, to avoid aneurysmal dilations), readily available, cost-effective, and morbidity should be minimal, especially when using autografts. No graft material meets all of these requirements. Moreover, the studies performed did not compare different types of grafts and biomaterials and were often single-centre retrospective studies so there is not a single graft that can be recommended for surgeons [1013]. The use of geometric principles introduced by Egydio may help to determine the exact site of the incision, and the shape and size of the defect to be grafted [1014]. Grafts for PD surgery can be classified into four types (Table 20) [1015]: Autografts: taken from the individual himself, they include the dermis, vein, temporalis fascia, fascia lata, tunica vaginalis, tunica albuginea and buccal mucosa.Allografts: also of human origin but from a deceased donor, including the pericardium, fascia lata and dura mater.Xenografts: extracted from different animal species and tissues, including bovine pericardium, porcine small intestinal submucosa, bovine and porcine dermis, and TachoSil® (matrix of equine collagen).Synthetic grafts: these include Dacron® and Gore-Tex®. All the autologous grafts have the inconvenience of possible graft harvesting complications. Dermal grafts are commonly associated with veno-occlusive ED (20%) due to lack of adaptability, so they have not been used in contemporary series [1013,1016-1027]. Vein grafts have the theoretical advantage of endothelial-to-endothelial contact when grafted to underlying cavernosal tissue. The saphenous vein has been the most commonly used vein graft [1028-1043]. For some extensive albuginea defects, more than one incision may be needed. Tunica albuginea grafts have perfect histological properties but have some limitations: the size that can be harvested, the risk of weakening penile support and making future procedures (penile prosthesis implantation) more complicated [1044-1046]. Tunica vaginalis is easy to harvest and has little tendency to contract due to its low metabolic requirements, although better results can be obtained if a vascular flap is used [1047-1051]. Under the pretext that by placing the submucosal layer on the corpus cavernosum the graft feeds on it and adheres more quickly, the buccal mucosal graft has recently been used with good short-term results [1052-1058]. Cadaveric dura mater is no longer used due to concerns about the possibility of infection [1059,1060]. Cadaveric pericardium (Tutoplast©) offers good results by coupling excellent tensile strength and multidirectional elasticity/expansion by 30% [950,1012,1023,1061,1062]. Cadaveric or autologous fascia lata or temporalis fascia offers biological stability and mechanical resistance [1063-1065]. Xenografts have become more popular in recent years. Small intestinal submucosa (SIS), a type I collagen-based xenogenic graft derived from the submucosal layer of the porcine small intestine, has been shown to promote tissue-specific regeneration and angiogenesis, and supports host cell migration, differentiation and growth of endothelial cells, resulting in tissue structurally and functionally similar to the original [1066-1075]. As mentioned above, pericardium (bovine, in this case) has good traction resistance and adaptability, and good host tolerance [1043,1076-1079]. Grafting by collagen fleece (TachoSil©) in PD has some major advantages such as decreased operating times, easy application and an additional haemostatic effect [1080-1085]. It is generally recommended that synthetic grafts, including polyester (Dacron®) and polytetrafluoroethylene (Gore-Tex®) are avoided, due to increased risks of infection, secondary graft inflammation causing tissue fibrosis, graft contractures, and possibility of allergic reactions [982,1086-1089]. Post-operative penile rehabilitation to improve surgical outcomes has been suggested with a number of studies describing the use of VED and PTT to prevent penile length loss of up to 1.5 cm [1090]. Daily nocturnal administration of PDE5I enhances nocturnal erections, encourages perfusion of the graft, and may minimise post-operative ED rates [1091]. Massages and stretching of the penis have also been recommended once wound healing is complete.

Ranges are in parentheses.ED = Erectile dysfunction; SIS = Small intestinal submucosa. It must be emphasised that there have been no RCTs comparing surgical outcomes in PD. The risk of ED seems to be greater for penile lengthening procedures [871]. Recurrent curvature is likely to be the result of failure to wait until the disease has stabilised before surgery is undertaken, re-activation of the condition following the development of stable disease, or the use of early re-absorbable sutures (e.g., Vicryl) that lose their tensile strength before ensuing fibrosis has resulted in acceptable strength of the repair. Accordingly, it is recommended that only non-absorbable sutures or slowly re-absorbed absorbable sutures (e.g., polydioxanone) should be used. With non-absorbable sutures, the knot should be buried to avoid troublesome irritation of the penile skin, but this issue may be alleviated by the use of slowly re-absorbable sutures (e.g., polydioxanone) [1094]. Penile numbness is a potential risk of any surgical procedure, involving mobilisation of the dorsal neurovascular bundle. This is usually a temporary neuropraxia, due to bruising of the dorsal sensory nerves. Given that the usual deformity is dorsal, the procedure most likely to induce this complication is a lengthening (grafting) procedure, or the association with (albeit rare) ventral curvature [971].
