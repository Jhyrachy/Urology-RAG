3.1.10.4. Steroids. Steroids have a large number of side effects [243-245,297], especially with long-term use. Most practitioners still consider steroids (either prednisolone or methylprednisolone) to be a fundamental adjunct to primary immunosuppression, even though successful steroid withdrawal has been achieved in the vast majority of patients in many prospective, randomised trials [243,245,246,297,302,303]. The risk of steroid withdrawal depends on the use of concomitant immuno-suppressive medication, immunological risk, ethnicity, and time after transplantation. Although the risk of rejection diminishes over time, potential benefits may be less prominent after a prolonged steroid treatment period [243-246,297]. Recent studies suggest similar efficacy but less diabetes after early steroid withdrawal or steroid minimisation in low risk patients treated with tacrolimus, MPA and induction (either basiliximab or ATG) [304,305].
