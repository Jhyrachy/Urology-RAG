3.16.2.8. prostate biopsy. 3.16.2.8.1. transperineal prostate biopsy total eight randomised studies including 1,596 patients compared impact biopsy route infectious complications. infectious complications significantly higher following transrectal biopsy (48 events among 789 men) compared transperineal biopsy (22 events among 807 men), [rr (95% cis) 2.48 (1.47 4.2) . addition, systematic review including 165 studies 162,577 patients described sepsis rates 0.1% 0.9% transperineal transrectal biopsies, respectively . finally, population-based study uk (n=73,630) showed lower re-admission rates sepsis patients transperineal versus transrectal biopsies (1.0% vs, 1.4%, respectively) . available evidence demonstrates transrectal approach abandoned favour transperineal approach despite possible logistical challenges. systematic review meta-analysis eight non-rcts reported significant differences patients receiving receiving antibiotic prophylaxis terms post-biopsy infection (0.11% vs. 0.31%) sepsis (0.13% vs. 0.09%), transperineal approach . line another systematic review meta-analysis 112 individual patient cohorts also showed significant difference number patients experiencing post-transperineal biopsy infection 1.35% 29,880 patients receiving antibiotic prophylaxis 1.22% 4,772 receiving antibiotic prophylaxis (p=0.8) . addition, two recently published rcts reported comparably low post-biopsy infection rates transperineal biopsy regardless whether antibiotic prophylaxis administered . growing body evidence suggest antibiotic prophylaxis may required transperineal biopsy; however, panel chosen wait number ongoing rcts report study findings making recommendation this. 3.16.2.8.2. transrectal prostate biopsy updated meta-analysis eleven rcts including 2,237 men showed use rectal povidone-iodine preparation biopsy, addition antimicrobial prophylaxis, resulted significantly lower rate infectious complications [rr (95% cis) 0.47 (0.36 0.61) [553,561-563]. single rcts showed evidence benefit perineal skin disinfection , reported advantage rectal povidone-iodine preparation biopsy compared biopsy . meta-analysis four rcts including 671 men evaluated use rectal preparation enema transrectal biopsy. significant advantage found regarding infectious complications [rr (95% cis) 0.96 (0.64 1.54) . updated meta-analysis 29 rcts 4,127 patients found evidence use peri-prostatic injection local anaesthesia resulted infectious complications injection [rr (95% cis) 1.08 (0.80 1.49)] . updated meta-analysis 10 rcts including 2,342 patients found extended biopsy templates showed comparable infectious complications standard templates [rr (95% cis) 0.82 (0.55 1.24)] . additional meta-analyses found difference infections complications regarding needle guide type (disposable vs. reusable), needle type (coaxial vs. non-coaxial), needle size (large vs. small), number injections peri-prostatic nerve block (standard vs. extended) . meta-analysis eleven studies 1,753 patients showed significantly reduced infections transrectal prostate biopsy using antimicrobial prophylaxis compared placebo/control [rr (95% cis) 0.56 (0.40 0.77)] . fluoroquinolones traditionally used antibiotic prophylaxis setting; however, overuse misuse fluoroquinolones resulted increase fluoroquinolone resistance. addition, european commission implemented stringent regulatory conditions regarding use fluoroquinolones resulting suspension indication peri-operative antibiotic prophylaxis including prostate biopsy . systematic review meta-analysis antibiotic prophylaxis prevention infectious complications following prostate biopsy concluded countries fluoroquinolones allowed antibiotic prophylaxis, minimum full one-day administration recommended . updated meta-analysis eight rcts 2,939 patients confirmed targeted therapy (antibiotic guidance based rectal swab microbiology) case fluoroquinolone resistance associated reduced infectious complications [rr (95% cis) 0.54 (0.40 0.72)] . addition, updated meta-analysis ten rcts 2,787 patients comparing augmented prophylaxis (combination two different classes antibiotics) standard prophylaxis showed augmented prophylaxis superior [rr (95% cis) 0.44 (0.32 0.59)] . countries use fluoroquinolones suspended cephalosporins aminoglycosides used individual agents comparable infectious complications based meta-analysis two rcts . updated meta-analysis four rcts compared fosfomycin trometamol fluoroquinolones [rr (95% cis) 0.62 (0.37 1.06)] . although initial rcts suggested fosfomycin trometamol superior latest swedish study, aimed recruit 3,448 patients, discontinued 42 patients due unusually high number hospitalisations fosfomycin trometamol group . therefore, routine general use critically assessed due relevant infectious complications also reported non-randomised studies . note indication fosfomycin trometamol prostate biopsy withdrawn germany manufacturers submit necessary pharmacokinetic data support indication. urologists advised check local guidance relation use fosfomycin trometamol prostate biopsy. another possibility use augmented prophylaxis without fluoroquinolones, although standard combination established date. finally, targeted prophylaxis based rectal swap/stool culture plausible, rcts available non-fluoroquinolones. see figure 1 prostate biopsy workflow reduce infections complications.
