5.5.2. medical conditions sleep disorders shared care pathway. causative categories nocturia comprise : bladder storage problems;24-hour polyuria (> 40 ml/kg urine output 24-hour period);nocturnal polyuria (np; defined excessive production urine individual’s main sleep period, i.e. nocturnal output exceeding 20% 24-hour urine output young, 33% urine output people > 65 );sleep disorders;mixed aetiology. potentially relevant systemic conditions impair physiological fluid balance, including influences levels free water, salt, solutes, plasma oncotic pressure; endocrine regulation e.g., antidiuretic hormone; natriuretic peptides; cardiovascular autonomic control; renal function; neurological regulation, e.g., circadian regulation pineal gland, renal innervation. nocturia commonly referred specialty without full insight cause, urologist must review likely mechanisms underlying presentation nocturia instigate review relevant specialties accordingly. thus, managing urologist needs evaluate nocturia patients context additional medical expertise available (table 3). proceed along lutd management pathway unless causative link lutd justifiably suspected, systemic sleep abnormalities considered. patients non-bothersome nocturia, medical evaluation (history physical examination) consider possibility early stages systemic disease, whether possibility earlier diagnosis therapy adjustment. important potentially treatable non-urological causes nocturia include obstructive sleep apnoea, congestive cardiac failure, poorly controlled diabetes mellitus medications (e.g., diuretics, lithium). table 3: shared care pathway nocturia, highlighting need manage potentially complex patients using relevant expertise causative factors urological contributionshared caremedical contributiondiagnosis lutdurological/luts evaluationnocturia symptom scoresbladder diarydiagnosis conditions causing npevaluate patient’s known conditionsscreening sleep disordersscreening potential causes polyuria*conservative managementbehavioural therapyfluid/sleep habits advicedrugs storage lutsdrugs voiding lutsisc/catherisationincreased exerciseleg elevationweight lossinterventional therapytherapy refractory storage lutstherapy refractory voiding lutsconservative managementantidiureticdiureticsdrugs aid sleepmanagementinitiation therapy new diagnosisoptimised therapy known conditions* potential causes polyurianephrological diseasetubular dysfunctionglobal renal dysfunctioncardiovascular diseasecardiac diseasevascular diseaseendocrine diseasediabetes insipidus/mellitushormones affecting diuresis/natriuresisneurological diseasepituitary renal innervationautonomic dysfunctionrespiratory diseaseobstructive sleep apnoeabiochemicalaltered blood oncotic pressure isc = intermittent self catheterisation
