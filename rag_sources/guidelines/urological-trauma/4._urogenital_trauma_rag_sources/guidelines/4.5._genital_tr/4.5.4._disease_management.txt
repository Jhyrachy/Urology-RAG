4.5.4. disease management. 4.5.4.1. animal bites local wound management depends extent tissue destruction. antibiotics prescribed accordance local resistance patterns [347-349]. possibility rabies infection must considered, taking account geographical location, animal involved, specific nature wound type attack (provoked/unprovoked). elderly immunosuppressed patients vaccinated human rabies immunoglobulin human diploid cell vaccine . 4.5.4.2. human bites cases human bites, apart wound management, infection considered since transmission viral diseases may occur, hepatitis b vaccine/immunoglobulin and/or immunodeficiency virus (hiv) post-exposure prophylaxis offered. details, see guidelines management human bite injuries . 4.5.4.3. blunt penile trauma blunt trauma flaccid penis usually cause tearing tunica. subcutaneous haematoma sexual intercourse, without associated rupture cavernosal tunica albuginea, require surgical intervention. cases, non-steroidal analgesics ice-packs recommended . 4.5.4.4. penile fracture thickness tunica albuginea flaccid state (approximately 2 mm) decreases erection 0.25-0.5 mm therefore vulnerable traumatic injury . penile fracture diagnosed, surgical intervention closure tunica albuginea recommended; ensures lowest rate negative long-term sequelae negative effect psychological wellbeing patient . approach usually circumferential incision proximal coronal sulcus enables complete degloving penis. increasingly, local longitudinal incisions centred area fracture ventral longitudinal approaches currently used . recent systematic review management penile fractures concluded immediate repair within 24 hours presentation ; however, delayed presentation prevent exploration . localisation may gained flexible cystoscopy performed prior incision, urethral trauma suspected eventually proven . surgical closure tunica carried using absorbable sutures. 4.5.4.5. penetrating penile trauma penetrating penile trauma non-operative management recommended small superficial injuries intact buck’s fascia . significant penetrating penile injuries, surgical exploration debridement necrotic tissue recommended. even extended injuries penis, primary alignment disrupted tissues may allow acceptable healing robust penile blood supply . principles care debridement devitalised tissue, preservation much viable tissues possible, haemostasis, diversion urine selected cases removal foreign bodies. tissues questionable viability may left subsequent definitive surgery. delayed repair needed, depending type injury extent tissue damage, usually takes place four six weeks trauma occurred. surgical approach depends upon site extent injury, subcoronal incision penile degloving usually gives good exposure. initially, defect tunica albuginea closed copious irrigation. much tissue loss, defect repaired either immediately delay patch (either autologous saphenous vein xenograft). elasticity genital skin means usually possible manage loss moderate amount penile skin; however, management difficult extensive injuries significant skin loss. tissue chosen reconstruction following trauma needs provide good coverage must suitable reconstruction. split-thickness skin grafting provides good coverage dependable take reproducible durable. however, split-thickness grafts contract full-thickness grafts use penile shaft kept minimum. skin grafts thickness least 0.4 mm used order reduce risk contraction . full-thickness skin grafting onto penile shaft gives less contracture, better cosmetic appearance resistance trauma intercourse, re-established . donor site may taken abdomen, buttock, thigh, axilla chosen according surgeon’s preference pattern injury. cases extensive destruction deeper tissues, later prosthetic placement considered, skin flaps, secure vascular supply, used. 4.5.4.6. penile avulsion injuries amputation acute management involves resuscitation patient, preparation surgical re-implantation penis recovered badly damaged. surgical re-implantation considered patients performed within 24 hours amputation . severed penis washed sterile saline, wrapped saline-soaked gauze, placed sterile bag, immersed iced water. penis must come direct contact ice. pressure dressing tourniquet placed around penile stump prevent excessive blood loss. re-attachment achieved non-microsurgical way, gives higher rates post-operative urethral stricture problems loss sensation . operating microscopically, corpora cavernosa urethra firstly aligned repaired. subsequently, dorsal penile arteries, dorsal vein dorsal nerves anastomosed. cavernosal arteries generally small anastomose. fascia skin closed layers urethral suprapubic catheter placed . severed penis cannot found, unsuitable re-attachment, end closed done partial penectomy. later reconstruction may employed lengthen penis (e.g., suspensory ligament division v-y plasty, pseudo-glans formation split-thickness skin grafting, etc.). delayed major reconstructive procedure, i.e. phalloplasty (either radial artery pubic), sometimes required injuries leave small non-functioning penile stump . 4.5.4.7. testicular dislocation either subcutaneous dislocation epifascial displacement testis internal dislocation. latter, testis positioned superficial external inguinal ring, inguinal canal abdominal cavity. traumatic dislocation testis treated manual replacement secondary orchidopexy. primary manual reposition cannot performed, immediate orchidopexy indicated. 4.5.4.8. haematocoele conservative management recommended haematoceles smaller three times size contralateral testis . large haematoceles, non-operative management fail, delayed surgery (more three days) often required. patients large haematoceles higher rate orchiectomy patients undergo early surgery, even non-ruptured testes . early surgical intervention results preservation testis 90% cases compared delayed surgeries result orchiectomy 45-55% patients . addition, non-operative management also associated prolonged hospital stays. therefore, large haematoceles treated surgically, irrespective presence testicular contusion rupture. least, blood clot evacuated tunica vaginalis sac relieve disability hasten recovery. 4.5.4.9. testicular rupture essential surgically explore equivocal patients whenever imaging studies cannot definitively exclude testicular rupture. involves exploration evacuation blood clots haematoma, excision necrotic testicular tubules closure tunica albuginea, usually running 3.0-absorbable sutures. 4.5.4.10. penetrating scrotal trauma penetrating injuries scrotum require surgical exploration debridement non-viable tissue. depending extent injury, primary reconstruction testis scrotum usually performed. complete disruption spermatic cord, re-alignment without vaso-vasostomy may considered surgically feasible . staged secondary microsurgical vaso-vasostomy performed rehabilitation, although cases reported . extensive destruction tunica albuginea, mobilisation free tunica vaginalis flap performed testicular closure. patient unstable reconstruction cannot achieved, orchiectomy indicated. prophylactic antibiotics recommended scrotal penetrating trauma, although data support approach lacking. extended laceration scrotal skin requires surgical intervention skin closure. due elasticity scrotum, defects primarily closed, even lacerated skin minimally attached scrotum . local wound management extensive initial wound debridement washout important scrotal convalescence. case extensive loss genital tissue, e.g., improvised explosive device blast injury, complex staged reconstructive surgical procedures often required . military testicular salvage rates increased last decades due improvements medical services (up 67.6%) . table 4.5.1: summary key points penile fracture testicular trauma summary key points:penile fracturethe common causes penile
