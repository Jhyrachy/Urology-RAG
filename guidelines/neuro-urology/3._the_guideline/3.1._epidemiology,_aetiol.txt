3.1. Epidemiology, aetiology and pathophysiology. 3.1.1. Introduction Neuro-urological symptoms may be caused by a variety of diseases and events affecting the nervous system controlling the LUT. The resulting neuro-urological symptoms depend predominantly on the location and the extent of the neurological lesion. There are no exact figures on the overall prevalence of neuro-urological disorders in the general population, but data are available on the prevalence of the underlying conditions and the relative risk of these for the development of neuro-urological symptoms. It is important to note that the majority of the data shows a very wide range of prevalence/incidence. This reflects the variability in the cohort (e.g., early or late-stage disease) and the frequently small sample sizes, resulting in a low level of evidence in most published data (summarised in Table 1). Table 1: Epidemiology of Neuro-Urological Disorders Suprapontine and pontine lesions and diseasesNeurological DiseaseFrequency in General PopulationType and Frequency of Neuro-Urological SymptomsCerebrovascular accident(Strokes)450 cases/100,000/yr (Europe) [9], 10% of cardiovascular mortality.Nocturia - overactive bladder (OAB) - urgency urinary incontinence (UUI) – neurogenic detrusor overactivity (NDO), other patterns less frequent [10]. 57-83% of neuro-urological symptoms at one month post-stroke, 71-80% spontaneous recovery at six months [11]. Persistence of urinary incontinence (UI) correlates with poor prognosis [12].Dementias:Alzheimer’s disease (80%),Vascular (10%), Other (10%).6.4% of adults > 65 yrs [13].OAB - UUI – NDO, 25% of incontinence in Alzheimer’sdisease, > 25% in other dementias: Lewy body, NPH, Binswanger, Nasu-Hakola, Pick Disease [14]. Incontinence three times more frequent in geriatric patients with dementia than without [15].Parkinsonian syndrome (PS)Idiopathic Parkinson’s disease (IPD): 75-80% of PS.Non-IPD: Parkinson’s-plus (18%):- Multiple system atrophy (MSA),- Progressive supranuclear palsy,- Corticobasal degeneration,- Dementia with Lewy bodies.Secondary Parkinson’s (2%)Second most prevalent neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer’s disease.Rising prevalence of IPD with age [16].MSA is the most frequentnon-IPD PS.LUTS affect 50% at onset, with urgency and nocturia being the most common. Patients with LUTS at presentation have worse disease progression in Parkinson’s disease [17]. LUTS prevalence data depend on gender, age, and Hoehn and Yahr stage [18].Infections account for a major cause of mortality in MSA [19].Impaired detrusor contractility with post-void residual (PVR) > 150 mL seems to be the urodynamic finding distinguishing MSA from IPD [20-22].Brain tumours26.8/100,000/yr in adults (> 19 yrs), (17.9 benign, 8.9 malignant) [23].Incontinence occurs mainly in frontal location (part of frontal syndrome or isolated in frontal location) [24].Cerebral palsyCerebral palsy: 3.1-3.6/1,000 in children aged 8 yrs [25].32-46% of patients with cerebral palsy suffer from UI, with 85% of patients having abnormal urodynamic studies (NDO most common 59%). Upper tract deterioration is rare (2.5%) [26,27].Traumatic brain injury235/100,000/yr [28].44% storage dysfunction,38% voiding dysfunction,60% urodynamic abnormalities [29].Normal pressure hydrocephalus0.5% of the population > 60, up to 2.9% of those > 65 [30].Classic triad of gait and cognitive disturbance along with neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction (NLUTD). The latter is mainly related to NDO and affects 76-83% of patients [30].Lesions and diseases between caudal brainstem and sacral spinal cordSpinal cord injury (SCI)Prevalence of traumatic SCI indeveloped countries ranges from 280 to 906/million [31].NDO and detrusor sphincter dyssynergia (DSD) (up to 95%) and detrusor underactivity (DU) (up to 83%) depending on the level of the lesion [32].Spina bifida (SB)Spina bifida 3-4/10,000Lumbar and lumbosacral form are the most common (60%) [33].Bladder function is impaired in up to 96% of SB patients [34]. Over 50% of patients are incontinent [35]. Patients with open and closed defects can have equally severe NLUTD [36].Hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP)Prevalence 1.3-9/100,000 [37].LUTS in about 75%, mainly urgency and voiding dysfunctionNDO in 81% (of whom 76% with DSD) [37]Lesions and diseases of the peripheral nervous systemLumbar spineDegenerative diseaseDisk prolapseLumbar canal stenosisMale (5%) and female (3%) > 35 yr. have had a lumbosciaticepisode related to disc prolapse.Incidence: approx. 5/100,000/yrMore common in females > 45 yr.26% difficulty to void and acontractile detrusor [38].Detrusor underactivity (up to 83%) [32].Tarlov cysts: early sensation of filling (70%), NDO (33%), and stress urinary incontinence (SUI) (33%) [39].Iatrogenic pelvic nerve lesionsRectal cancer.Cervical cancer (multimodaltherapy, radiotherapy and surgery).Endometriosis surgery.After abdomino-perineal resection: 50% urinary retention.After total mesorectal excision: 10-30% voiding dysfunction [40].Peripheral neuropathyDiabetesOther causes of peripheralneuropathy causing neuro-urological symptoms:- Alcohol abuse;- Lumbosacral zone andgenital herpes;- Guillain Barre syndrome;- Porphyria;- and Sarcoidosis.Worldwide, prevalence ofpharmacologically treated diabetes 8.3% [41].OAB +/- UUI [42].Hypersensitivity and DU at later phase [42].Myasthenia gravisPrevalence 20/100,000 [43]Increased daytime frequency, nocturia, incontinence [43]Disseminated central diseasesMultiple sclerosis (MS)Prevalence: 83/100,000 in Europe [44].10% of MS patients present withvoiding dysfunction at disease onset, 75% of patients will develop it after 10 yrs of MS [45].NDO: 65% [45], 43% [46].DSD: 35% [45,46].DU: 25% [45].
