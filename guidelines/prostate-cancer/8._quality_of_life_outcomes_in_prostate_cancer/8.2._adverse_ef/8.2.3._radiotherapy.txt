8.2.3. Radiotherapy. 8.2.3.1. Side effects of external beam radiotherapy Analysis of the toxicity outcomes of the ProtecT trial shows that patients treated with EBRT and six months of ADT report bowel toxicity including persistent diarrhoea, bowel urgency and/or incontinence and rectal bleeding (described in detail in Section 8.3.1.1 below) [1364]. Participants in the ProtecT study were treated with 3D-CRT and studies using IMRT demonstrate less bowel toxicity than noted previously with 3D-CRT [1365]. A SR and meta-analysis of observational studies comparing patients exposed or unexposed to RT in the course of treatment for PCa demonstrates an increased risk of developing second cancers for bladder (OR: 1.39), colorectal (OR: 1.68) and rectum (OR: 1.62) with similar risks over lag times of five and ten years. Absolute excess risks over ten years are small (1–4%) but should be discussed with younger patients in particular [1366]. Patient-reported outcomes suggest a temporary drop in the EPIC hormonal and sexual domains when six months af ADT was added to radiotherapy, with a disappearance of any clinical relevant difference at one year [1147,1367]. 8.2.3.2. Side effects from brachytherapy Some patients experience significant urinary complications following implantation such as urinary retention (1.5-22%), with post-implantation TURP reported as being required in up to 8.7% of cases, and incontinence (0–19%) [1368]. Chronic urinary morbidity is more common with combined EBRT and BT and can occur in up to 20% of patients, depending on the severity of the symptoms before BT. Urethral strictures account for at least 50% of urinary complications and can be resolved with dilation in the majority [719,726]. Prevention of morbidity depends on careful patient selection and IPSS score, backed up by urodynamic studies.
