4.2.4.1.3.6. Composite treatments for PFMT. A Cochrane review found insufficient evidence to state whether there were additional effects by adding PFMT to other active treatments (including vaginal cones, electromagnetic stimulation, biofeedback, continence pessary, drugs) when compared with the same active treatment alone for female SUI or mixed UI. However, these results should be interpreted with caution as most of the comparisons were investigated in small, single trials. Also, none of the included trials reported data on adverse events associated with the PFMT regimen, thereby making it very difficult to evaluate the safety of PFMT [333]. A single-blind RCT evaluated whether peri-operative supervised PFMT was superior to standard care (handout) in terms of improvements in SUI symptoms, cure rate, and/or post-operative filling or voiding symptoms among women undergoing synthetic MUS insertion for SUI. The results showed that supervised PFMT improves SUI cure rates associated with synthetic MUS insertion with OR > 3 when considering symptoms of SUI, but does not improve post-operative continence function as measured by a pad test, nor does it lead to fewer post-operative voiding or filling symptoms [334].
