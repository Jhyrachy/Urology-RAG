3.3.8. Renal function. In many patients with neuro-urological disorders, the UUT is at risk, particularly in patients who develop high detrusor pressure during the filling phase. Although effective treatment can reduce this risk, there is still a relatively high incidence of renal morbidity [128,129]. Patients with SCI or SB have a higher risk of developing renal failure compared with patients with slowly progressive non-traumatic neurological disorders, such as MS and Parkinson’s disease (PD) [130]. Caregivers must be informed of this risk and instructed to watch carefully for any signs or symptoms of a possible deterioration in the patient’s renal function. In patients with poor muscle mass cystatin C based glomerular filtration rate (GFR) seems to be more accurate in detecting chronic kidney disease than serum creatinine estimated GFR [131]. There are no high-level evidence publications available which show the optimal management to preserve renal function in these patients [132].
