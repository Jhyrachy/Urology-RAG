3.16.2. classification systems. urinary stone formation result complex process involving genetic, dietary, metabolic, anatomical factors presence infection. 3.16.2.1. calcium stones calcium stones usually made calcium oxalate calcium phosphate. super-saturation calcium (hypercalciuria) oxalate (hyperoxaluria) decreased concentration inhibitors, citrate (hypocitraturia) magnesium (hypomagnesemia) play major role formation calcium oxalate stones. higher super-saturations calcium oxalate shown associated multiple stone disease . hypercalciuria: defined 24-hour urinary calcium excretion 4 mg/kg/day (0.1 mmol/kg/ day) child weighing < 60 kg. infants younger three months, 5 mg/kg/day (0.125 mmol/kg/day) considered upper limit normal calcium excretion . hypercalciuria classified either idiopathic secondary. idiopathic hypercalciuria diagnosed clinical, laboratory, radiographic investigations fail delineate underlying cause leading hypercalcaemia. urinary calcium may increase patients high sodium chloride intake. secondary hypercalciuria occurs known process produces excessive urinary calcium. secondary hypercalcaemic hypercalciuria, high serum calcium level may due increased bone resorption (hyperparathyroidism, hyperthyroidism, immobilisation, acidosis, metastatic disease) gastrointestinal hyperabsorption (hypervitaminosis d) . good screening test hypercalciuria compares ratio urinary calcium creatinine. normal calcium-to-creatinine ratio children less 0.2. calculated ratio higher 0.2, repeat-testing indicated. neonates infants higher calcium excretion lower creatinine excretion older children . follow-up ratios normal, additional testing hypercalciuria needed. however, ratio remains elevated, timed 24-hour urine collection obtained calcium excretion calculated. 24-hour calcium excretion test standard criterion diagnosis hypercalciuria. calcium excretion higher 4 mg/kg/day (0.1 mmol/kg/day), diagnosis hypercalciuria confirmed evaluation warranted: levels serum bicarbonate, creatinine, alkaline phosphatase, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, ph, parathyroid hormone. freshly voided urine measured ph [1053-1055]. addition calcium, 24-hour urine analysis also include phosphorus, sodium, magnesium, uric acid, citrate oxalate. initial management always increase fluid intake urinary flow. dietary modification mandatory part effective therapy. child referred dietician accurately assess daily intake calcium, animal protein, sodium. dietary sodium restriction recommended well maintenance calcium intake consistent daily needs child . brief trial low calcium diet carried determine exogenous calcium intake and/or calcium hyperabsorption contributing high urinary calcium. recommendation restrict calcium intake daily needs child avoided. moreover, low calcium intake risk factor stone formation (le: 3). hydrochlorothiazide thiazide-type diuretics may used treat idiopathic hypercalciuria, especially calcium renal leak, starting dosage 0.5-1 mg/kg/day [1058-1061] (le: 3). long-term use thiazide-type diuretics, decrease hypocalciuric effect may seen third month may cause hypokalemia, hypocitraturia, hyperuricaemia hypomagnesaemia. therefore, control blood serum values performed regular intervals. citrate therapy also useful citrate levels low hypercalciuria persists, despite therapies (le: 4). hyperoxaluria: 10-15% oxalate dietary. average child excretes less 50 mg (0.57 mmol)/1.73 m2/day [1063-1065], infants excrete four times much. hyperoxaluria may result increased dietary intake, enteric hyperabsorption (as short bowel syndrome) inborn error metabolism. rare primary hyperoxaluria, one two liver enzymes play role metabolism oxalate may deficient. increased deposition calcium oxalate kidneys, renal failure may ensue, resulting deposition calcium oxalate tissues (oxalosis). diagnosis made upon laboratory findings severe hyperoxaluria clinical symptoms. definitive diagnosis requires liver biopsy assay enzyme activity. patients primary hyperoxaluria exhibit substantial clinical burden renal stones, utis pain, requiring frequent healthcare resource use . forms hyperoxaluria, mentioned earlier, may due hyperabsorption oxalate inflammatory bowel syndrome, pancreatitis short bowel syndrome. yet, majority children ‘mild’ (idiopathic) hyperoxaluria, mildly elevated urine oxalate levels cases. treatment hyperoxaluria consists promotion high urine flow, restriction dietary oxalate regular calcium intake. pyridoxine may useful reducing urine levels, especially primary hyperoxaluria. citrate administration increases inhibitory urine activity (le: 4). hypocitraturia: citrate urinary stone inhibitor. acts binding calcium directly inhibiting growth aggregation calcium oxalate well calcium phosphate crystals. thus low urine citrate may significant cause calcium stone disease. adults, hypocitraturia excretion urinary citrate less 320 mg/day (1.5 mmol/day); value must adjusted children depending body size [1068-1070]. hypocitraturia usually occurs absence concurrent symptoms known metabolic derangements. may also occur association metabolic acidosis, distal tubular acidosis diarrhoeal syndromes. environmental factors lower urinary citrate include high protein intake excessive salt intake. many reports emphasise significance hypocitraturia paediatric calcium stone disease. presence hypocitraturia ranges 30% 60% children calcium stone disease . urine calcium-to-citrate ratios higher recurrent calcium stone forming children solitary formers . restoration normal citrate levels advocated reduce stone formation, although relevant studies children. hypocitraturia treated potassium citrate starting dose 1 meq/kg, given two divided doses (le: 3). side effects potassium citrate rare time include non-specific gastrointestinal complaints. potassium citrate used caution hyperkalemic chronic renal failure conditions. 3.16.2.2. uric acid stones uric acid stones responsible urinary calculi 4-8% children. uric acid end product purine metabolism. hyperuricosuria main cause uric acid stone formation children. daily output uric acid 10 mg/kg/day (0.6 mmol/kg/day) considered hyperuricosuria . formation uric acid stones mainly dependent presence acidic urinary composition. uric acid dissociation solubility strongly reduced ph < 5.8. ph becomes alkaline, uric acid crystals become soluble risk uric acid stone formation reduced. familial idiopathic form hyperuricosuria, children usually normal serum uric acid levels. children, caused uric acid overproduction secondary inborn errors metabolism, myeloproliferative disorders causes cell breakdown. hyperuricosuria also caused high purine protein intake. although hyperuricosuria risk factor calcium oxalate stone formation adults, appear significant risk factor children. uric acid stones non-opaque stones. plain x-rays insufficient show uric acid stones, renal sonography spiral ct used diagnosis. alkalinisation urine mainstay therapy prevention uric acid stones. citrate preparations useful alkalinising agents. maintaining urine ph 6 6.5 sufficient prevent uric acid stones . patients failed conservative measures sustaining hyperuricosuria hyperuricemia, stone recurrences myeloproliferative diseases, allopurinol (10 mg/kg) may used. medication may cause several drug reactions (rash, diarrhoea, eosinophilia) cautiously used chronic renal failure patients. 3.16.2.3. cystine stones cystinuria cause cystine stone formation accounts 2-6% urinary stones children. cystinuria incompletely recessive autosomal disorder characterised failure renal tubules reabsorb four basic amino acids: cystine, ornithine, lysine arginine. four amino acids, cystine poor solubility urine, cystine stones may form case excessive excretion urine. cystine solubility ph-dependent, cysteine precipitation beginning ph levels < 7.0. metabolic conditions, hypercalciuria, hypocitraturia hyperuricosuria, may accompany cystinuria, leading formation mixed-composition stones. cystine stones faintly radiopaque may difficult visualise regular radiograph studies. also hard texture difficult disintegrate extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (swl). cystinuric patients present larger stones time diagnosis, higher new stone formation rates, higher risk surgery . medical treatment cystine stones aims reduce cystine saturation urine increase solubility. initial treatment consists maintaining high urine flow use alkalinising agents, potassium citrate maintain urine ph 7.0 (better 7.5). treatment fails, use α-mercaptopropionyl glycine d-penicillamin may increase cystine solubility reduce cystine levels urine prevent stone formation. side effects drugs mostly mild include gastrointestinal complaints (alterations taste odour), fever rash, however associated severe side effects, bone marrow depression, nephrotic syndrome epidermolysis . 3.16.2.4. infection stones (struvite stones) infection-related stones constitute nearly 5% urinary stones children, though incidence increases 10% younger ages non-endemic regions . bacteria capable producing urease enzyme (proteus, klebsiella, pseudomonas) responsible formation stones. urease converts urea ammonia bicarbonate, alkalinising urine converting bicarbonate carbonate. alkaline environment, triple phosphates form, eventually resulting supersaturated environment magnesium ammonium phosphate carbonate apatite, turn leads stone formation. addition bacterial elimination, stone elimination essential treatment, stones harbour infection antibiotic treatment effective. consideration given investigating congenital problem causes stasis infection. genitourinary tract anomalies predispose formation stones.
