4.3. Clinically significant prostate cancer. The descriptor ‘clinically significant’ is widely used to differentiate PCa that may cause morbidity or death in a specific patient from types of PCa that rarely do. This distinction is particularly important as insignificant PCa is common [8]. Unless this distinction is made, such cancers are at high risk of being over-treated, with the treatment itself risking harmful side effects to patients. The over-treatment of insignificant PCas has also been criticised as a major drawback of population-based screening and individual early detection [103]. Although pathological factors are often used to delineate insignificant PCa, the definition of significant vs. insignificant is a balance between tumour and patient factors. High-risk PCa is significant in almost all men, except when life expectancy is limited. Low-risk PCa is insignificant in almost all men. From a pathological point of view, in large studies of RP specimens with only ISUP grade group 1 disease, EPE (0.3%) [104] and biochemical recurrence (3.5%) were rare, and seminal vesicle (SV) invasion or lymph node (LN) metastasis did not occur at all [105,106]. International Society of Urological Pathology grade group 1 disease at RP itself can therefore be considered clinically insignificant. Whilst ISUP grade group 1 bears the hallmarks of cancer histologically, ISUP grade group 1 at RP itself does not behave in a clinically malignant fashion [107]. It is important to note that the studies showing absence of metastasis in ISUP grade group 1 were all done on RP specimens; ISUP grade group 1 on biopsy is associated with a low risk of developing metastasis and disease-specific death, due to under-sampling of a higher-grade component. In a contemporary retrospective study of men with cT1-T2 cN0 ISUP grade group 1 PCa at mpMRI-targeted biopsy, 72% had ISUP grade group ≥ 2, 9% ISUP grade group ≥ 3, 25% had pT3a and 4% pT3b at subsequent RP [108]. Finally, modifications in PCa grading has led to a grade shift during the past ten to fifteen years; for instance the introduction of the ISUP 2005 led to 20% of pre-ISUP 2005 GS 6 tumours being upgraded to GS 7 or higher, which has to be taken into account when interpreting older studies [109]. The current standard practice of MRI-targeted and template biopsies has improved diagnostic accuracy [110], however sampling error may still occur such that higher grade cancer could be missed. This should especially be considered in case of high PSA density, high pathological biopsy tumour volume and a visible lesion at MRI, but only ISUP grade group 1 at biopsy [111,112]. Another complexity in defining insignificant cancer is that ISUP grade group 1 may progress to higher grades over time, becoming clinically significant at a later biopsy [113]. Therefore, although ISUP grade group 1 itself can be described as clinically insignificant, it is important to take into account other factors, including age, imaging prior to biopsy and adequate sampling core number. When combined with low-risk clinical factors (see Table 4.3), ISUP grade group 1 represents low-risk PCa and recommended management options are active surveillance (AS) or watchful waiting (WW) (see Sections 6.2.1.1 & 6.2.1.2). It has been proposed to rename ISUP grade group 1 “tumours” omitting the “cancer” label [114,115]. At this moment, no broad consensus yet exists for changing this disease taxonomy [116,117]. Instead, although it is probably insignificant cancer, it should be appropriately observed. Epidemiological and autopsy data suggest that a proportion of ISUP grade group 2 PCa would remain undetectable during a man’s life [118] and therefore may be over-treated. In current guidelines deferred treatment may be offered to select patients with intermediate-risk PCa [119], but clear evidence is lacking for appropriate selection criteria [120]. Recent papers have defined clinically significant cancer differently, commonly using ISUP grade group 2 and above and even ISUP grade group 3 and above, demonstrating the lack of consensus and evolution of its definition [121,122]. Some papers provide more than one definition within a single study [123,124]. Since there is insufficient data to relate modern histological grading to hard clinical endpoints, it is imperative that authors define and state in their own studies what they believe csPCa is, including exactly how the disease was diagnosed.
