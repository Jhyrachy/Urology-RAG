4.2. Tumour grade. Non-urothelial urethral carcinoma is graded by a trinomial system that differentiates between well-differentiated (G1), moderately-differentiated (G2), and poorly-differentiated tumours (G3). In primary urothelial carcinoma histological subtypes are extremely rare. Table 4.2 lists the different grading systems according to the WHO 2022 system [33].
