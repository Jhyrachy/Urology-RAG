3.19.2. Classification systems of the urethral valves. Up until today, the original classification by Hugh Hampton Young is the most commonly used classification [1306], which described three categories: type I, type II and type III. However, today, only type I and type III are found to be obstructive. Hampton Youngâ€™s descriptions of type I and III are as follows: Type I (90-95%): In the most common type there is a ridge lying on the floor of the urethra, continuous with the verumontanum, which takes an anterior course and divides into two fork-like processes in the region of the bulbo-membranous junction [1306]. Type III: Has been found at different levels of the posterior urethra and which apparently bears no relation to the verumontanum. This obstruction attaches to the entire circumference of the urethra, with a small opening in the centre [1296].
