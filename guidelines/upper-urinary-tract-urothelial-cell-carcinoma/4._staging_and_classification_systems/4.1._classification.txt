4.1. Classification. The classification and morphology of UTUC and BC are similar [1]. However because of the difficulty in adequate sample acquisition, it is often difficult to distinguish between non-invasive papillary tumours [83], flat lesions (carcinoma in situ [CIS]), and invasive carcinoma in biopsies. Therefore, histological grade is often used for clinical decision making as it is strongly associated with pathological stage [84].
