4.5.7.8. Urethrolysis. Bladder outlet obstruction in women occurring as a complication of surgery for SUI may be managed surgically by urethrolysis, to regain urethral mobility. Urethrolysis may involve removal of peri-urethral anti-incontinence sutures, scar tissue and fibrosis. Case series showed success rates measured as improved voiding and lower residual volumes, improvement, or resolution of symptoms and QoL, and improvement of urodynamic parameters after treatment [575-577]. De novo SUI was reported in 39% in one study [577]. Another study reported an association of persistent postoperative bladder symptoms with greater delay to performing urethrolysis [578].
