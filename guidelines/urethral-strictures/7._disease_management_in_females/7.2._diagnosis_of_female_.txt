7.2. Diagnosis of female urethral strictures. Twenty-four studies detail investigations leading to a diagnosis of FUS (see supplementary Table S7.2). In all cases a full history was taken, and a detailed pelvic examination was performed to assess for prolapse, masses, scars and vulval dermatological disorders such as LS, lichen planus or vulvo-vaginal atrophy. Flow rate and US PVR assessment was evaluated in nineteen (75%) and eighteen (71%) studies, respectively. Lateral VCUG was performed routinely in sixteen studies (63%) and as required in one study (4%). Cystourethroscopy was performed routinely in fourteen studies (54%) and as required in two studies (8%). Urodynamics (UDS) were performed routinely in four studies (17%) and as required in seven studies (30%) whilst video-urodynamics (VUDS) were performed routinely in three studies (13%) and urethral calibration also in four studies (13%). Pelvic MRI was performed as required in four series (17%) whilst transrectal US (TRUS) and renal US were each performed routinely in two series (8%) and intravenous urography (IVU) in ten (4%). Flow rate and PVR assessment make inherent sense as initial non-invasive screening tools and allow for simple monitoring of effect of treatment. Voiding cystourethrography and/or VUDS will permit diagnosis of BOO [23,474], visualisation of ballooning above the proximal end of the FUS [135], and delineation of alternate or co-existent diagnoses such as detrusor overactivity (DO) and SUI [128], although VCUG, VUDS and UDS require the ability to insert a 6 Fr catheter and may not be possible without preliminary urethral dilatation in all cases of FUS [475]. Likewise, passage of a cystourethroscopy will require a preliminary dilation in the majority of cases even when a paediatric uretero-renoscope is utilised [126]. Cystourethroscopy will allow for formal identification of the distal end of the FUS and will also allow for exclusion of a functional cause of BOO [135]. Magnetic resonance imaging is performed mainly to exclude alternate pathology such as urethral diverticulum and urethral carcinoma and also allows assessment of the degree of urethral fibrosis associated with FUS [475]. Proponents of TRUS utilise it in lieu of MRI and also for visualisation of the dilated urethra above the proximal end of the FUS. Recent gel-infused USS has been assessed and found to more accurate means of diagnosing stricture and associated spongiofibrosis than cystoscopy and videourodynamics in a small preliminary study (n=8) [476].
