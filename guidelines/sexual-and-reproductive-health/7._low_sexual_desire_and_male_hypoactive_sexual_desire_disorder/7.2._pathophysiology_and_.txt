7.2. Pathophysiology and risk factors. Several aetiological factors are considered to contribute to the pathophysiology of LSD. Levine proposed three components of sexual desire drive (biological), motivation (psychological) and wish (cultural) [818]. However, it is believed that both in the surveys and clinical practice those three components are usually found interwoven [819]. 7.2.1. Psychological aspects The endorsement of negative thoughts during sexual intercourse (i.e., concerns about erection, lack of erotic thoughts, and restrictive attitudes toward sexuality) predicts LSD in men [820,821]. Furthermore, feeling shame during sexual intercourse, because of negative sexual thoughts (e.g., concern about achieving an erection), characterises men with LSD as opposed to women with the same condition [822]. Psychopathological symptoms stemming from a crisis context negatively impacted male sexual desire [332], as well. In addition, dyadic male sexual desire was best accounted for by sexual satisfaction [823]. It is worth noting that, despite LSD being less common in men than in women [816], it is the most frequent complaint in couples’ therapy [824]. Therefore, the role of relationship factors must be addressed. In addition, anxiety proneness has been associated with LSD in men and is expected to shift men’s attention from erotic cues to worrying thoughts, thereby decreasing sexual desire [825]. Finally, it is worth noting that current approaches focus on sexual desire discrepancies between partners; the focus on discrepancies rather than on the partner who presents low desire not only reduces stigma, but also provides new opportunities for managing desire in the relationship context [826]. 7.2.2. Biological aspects Testosterone seems to be essential for a man’s sexual desire; however, sexual desire does not directly relate to the circulating level of testosterone, especially in older men [827]. The biological and psychological components that take place in the pathophysiology of LSD are shown in Table 17 [819,828]. In addition to these factors, there is some speculation about the role of the thyroid and oxytocin hormones [555,829].

Risk factors In an international survey aimed at estimating the prevalence and correlates of sexual problems in 13,882 women and 13,618 men from 29 countries (Global Study of Sexual Attitudes and Behaviours), risk factors for male LSD were age 60-69 and 70-80 years, poor overall health, vascular diseases, being a current smoker, belief that ageing reduces sex, divorce in the past 3 years, financial problems in the last 3 years, major depression, being worried about the future of a relationship and less than one sexual relation in a week [205]. In a recent study that determined the factors associated with LSD in a large sample of middle-aged German men, PE, ED, and lower urinary tract symptoms were associated with LSD [817]. In contrast, men having more than two children, higher frequency of solo masturbation, perceived importance of sexuality, and higher sexual self-esteem were less likely to have LSD [817].
