8.2.3.2.2. tunical lengthening procedures. tunical lengthening procedures performed concave side penis making incision partial excision plaque, coverage defect graft. although tunical lengthening procedures rarely lead long-term penile length gain, aim minimise penile shortening caused plication tunica albuginea, correct complex deformities. practice, tunical lengthening procedures often combined penile plication shortening procedures correct residual curvature therefore may also result penile shortening . tunical lengthening surgery preferable patients significant penile shortening, severe curvature and/or complex deformities (hourglass hinge) without underlying ed. definition severe curvature proposed > 60o, although studies validated threshold. concave side penis, point maximum curvature, usually coincides location plaque, incision made, creating defect albuginea covered graft. complete plaque removal plaque excision may associated higher rates post-operative ed due venous leak, partial excision cases florid calcification may permissible . patients pre-operative ed informed significant risk post-operative ed 50% . large number different grafts used. ideal graft resistant traction, easy suture manipulate, flexible (although much, avoid aneurysmal dilations), readily available, cost-effective, morbidity minimal, especially using autografts. graft material meets requirements. moreover, studies performed compare different types grafts biomaterials often single-centre retrospective studies single graft recommended surgeons . use geometric principles introduced egydio may help determine exact site incision, shape size defect grafted . grafts pd surgery classified four types (table 20) : autografts: taken individual himself, include dermis, vein, temporalis fascia, fascia lata, tunica vaginalis, tunica albuginea buccal mucosa.allografts: also human origin deceased donor, including pericardium, fascia lata dura mater.xenografts: extracted different animal species tissues, including bovine pericardium, porcine small intestinal submucosa, bovine porcine dermis, tachosil® (matrix equine collagen).synthetic grafts: include dacron® gore-tex®. autologous grafts inconvenience possible graft harvesting complications. dermal grafts commonly associated veno-occlusive ed (20%) due lack adaptability, used contemporary series [1013,1016-1027]. vein grafts theoretical advantage endothelial-to-endothelial contact grafted underlying cavernosal tissue. saphenous vein commonly used vein graft [1028-1043]. extensive albuginea defects, one incision may needed. tunica albuginea grafts perfect histological properties limitations: size harvested, risk weakening penile support making future procedures (penile prosthesis implantation) complicated [1044-1046]. tunica vaginalis easy harvest little tendency contract due low metabolic requirements, although better results obtained vascular flap used [1047-1051]. pretext placing submucosal layer corpus cavernosum graft feeds adheres quickly, buccal mucosal graft recently used good short-term results [1052-1058]. cadaveric dura mater longer used due concerns possibility infection . cadaveric pericardium (tutoplast©) offers good results coupling excellent tensile strength multidirectional elasticity/expansion 30% . cadaveric autologous fascia lata temporalis fascia offers biological stability mechanical resistance [1063-1065]. xenografts become popular recent years. small intestinal submucosa (sis), type collagen-based xenogenic graft derived submucosal layer porcine small intestine, shown promote tissue-specific regeneration angiogenesis, supports host cell migration, differentiation growth endothelial cells, resulting tissue structurally functionally similar original [1066-1075]. mentioned above, pericardium (bovine, case) good traction resistance adaptability, good host tolerance [1043,1076-1079]. grafting collagen fleece (tachosil©) pd major advantages decreased operating times, easy application additional haemostatic effect [1080-1085]. generally recommended synthetic grafts, including polyester (dacron®) polytetrafluoroethylene (gore-tex®) avoided, due increased risks infection, secondary graft inflammation causing tissue fibrosis, graft contractures, possibility allergic reactions [982,1086-1089]. post-operative penile rehabilitation improve surgical outcomes suggested number studies describing use ved ptt prevent penile length loss 1.5 cm . daily nocturnal administration pde5i enhances nocturnal erections, encourages perfusion graft, may minimise post-operative ed rates . massages stretching penis also recommended wound healing complete. table 20: results tunical lengthening procedures pd (data
