4.6. Carcinoma in situ. Carcinoma in situ is an intra-epithelial, HG, non-invasive UC. It can be missed or misinterpreted as an inflammatory lesion during cystoscopy if not biopsied. Carcinoma in situ is often multifocal and can occur in the bladder, but also in the upper urinary tract (UUT), prostatic ducts and urethra [64]. From a clinical point of view, CIS may be classified as [65]: Primary: isolated CIS with no previous or concurrent papillary tumours and no previous CIS;Secondary: CIS detected during follow-up of patients with a previous tumour that was not CIS;Concurrent: CIS in the presence of any other urothelial tumour in the bladder.
