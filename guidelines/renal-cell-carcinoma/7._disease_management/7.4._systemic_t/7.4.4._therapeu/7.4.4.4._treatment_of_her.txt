7.4.4.4. Treatment of hereditary RCC. 7.4.4.4.1.von-Hippel-Lindau-disease-associated RCC Patients with VHL disease often develop RCC and tumours and cysts in other organs including adrenal glands, CNS, retinal haemangioblastomas, and pancreas, and commonly undergo several surgical resections in their lifetime. In VHL disease, belzutifan, a HIF-2Î± inhibitor, has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA, August 2021) for the treatment of ccRCC and other neoplasms associated with VHL for the treatment of tumours that do not require immediate surgery. Approval was based on the results from a phase II, open-label, single-arm trial in 61 patients with tumours not larger than 3 cm [59]. Belzutifan induced partial responses with an RCC ORR of 49%, and a disease control rate of 98.4% after 21.8 months treatment. All patients with pancreatic lesions had an ORR of 77%, and those with CNS haemangioblastoma had a 30% response rate. In total, 33% of patients reported > grade III adverse events, and seven patients (11.5%) discontinued the treatment. In the treatment with pazopanib for VHL only 52% continued with the treatment after 24 weeks [617]. A longer follow-up at 37.8 months, ORR for RCC was increased to 64%, with a median time to response of 11.1 months (range, 2.7 to 30.5). Median duration of response per Kaplan-Meier estimate was not reached (range, 5.4+ to 35.8+ months). Thirty-four of 39 patients with a confirmed response (87%) remain in response as of the data cut-off date (September 2022) [557]. With favourable efficacy results and with relatively low-grade side effects, belzutifan seems to be a valuable contribution to the treatment of patients with the VHL disease. The EMA has not yet considered belzutifan for approval in VHL disease.
