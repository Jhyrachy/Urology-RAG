3.16.5. Summary of evidence and recommendations for the management of urinary stones. Summary of evidenceLEThe incidence of stone disease in children is increasing.2Contemporary surgical treatment is based on minimally invasive modalities. Open surgery is very rarely indicated.2aThe term ‘clinically insignificant residual fragments’ is not appropriate for children since most of them become symptomatic and require intervention.2bMajority of the kidney stones < 3 mm in infants resolve spontaneously.3 RecommendationsStrength ratingUse plain abdominal X-ray and ultrasound as the primary imaging techniques for the diagnosis and follow-up of stones.StrongUse low-dose non-contrast computed tomography in cases with a doubtful diagnosis, especially of ureteral stones or complex cases requiring surgery.StrongPerform a metabolic evaluation in any child with urinary stone disease. Any kind of interventional treatment should be supported with medical treatment for the underlying metabolic abnormality, if detected.StrongLimit open surgery under circumstances in which the child is very young with large stones, in association with congenital problems requiring surgical correction and/or with severe orthopaedic deformities that limit positioning for endoscopic procedures.StrongObserve infant microlithiasis, unless symptoms occur or size increases significantly.Strong
