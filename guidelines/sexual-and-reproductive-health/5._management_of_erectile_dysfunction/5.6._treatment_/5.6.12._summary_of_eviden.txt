5.6.12. Summary of evidence and recommendations for treatment of ED. Summary of evidenceLifestyle changes can lead to ED improvement in specific populations.PDE5Is are associated with significant improvement of erectile function (EF) with a good overall safety profile.There are no demonstrated differences among different PDE5Is in terms of treatment efficacy.Topical/intraurethral alprostadil is effective in improving EF but data are still limited.Vacuum therapy can improve EF with a wide range of treatment satisfaction rate.Intracavernous injection with alprostadil is an effective treatment for ED; however, it has relatively high treatment drop-out rates.Low-intensity shockwave therapy can a mild improvement in EF among patients with vasculogenic ED.Intracavernous injections of PRP have led to a mild improvement of EF among patients with organic ED, but the available evidence is still insufficient to provide a recommendation regarding its use.BoNT-A has been shown to improve response rate to medical treatment for ED in patients who were non-responsive to oral or injective therapies, but data are still limited.Penile rehabilitation with PDE5Is after RP does not increase the chance of spontaneous EF recovery.Penile prosthesis implantation is associated with high satisfaction rate among patients with ED.There is no difference in terms of efficacy and safety among different penile implants available or surgical approaches used. RecommendationsStrength ratingFully inform patients of the mechanism of action and how phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5Is) should be taken, as incorrect use/inadequate information is the main causes of a lack of response to PDE5Is.StrongDirect the patient to Cognitive Behaviour Therapy as a psychological approach (include the partner), when indicated, combined with medical treatment to maximise treatment outcomes.StrongDiscuss with patients undergoing active treatment for prostate cancer (PCa) about the risk of sexual changes other than erectile dysfunction (ED), including sexual desire reduction, changes in orgasm, anejaculation, Peyronie like disease and penile size changes.StrongInitiate lifestyle changes and risk factor modification prior to, or at the same time as, initiating ED treatments.StrongUse PDE5Is as first-line therapy for the treatment of ED.StrongUse intracavernous injections as an alternative first-line therapy in well-informed patients or as second-line therapy.StrongUse topical/intra-urethral alprostadil as an alternative first-line therapy in well-informed patients who:do not wish to have or are not suitable for oral vasoactive therapy;do not wish to have intracavernous injections;in patients who prefer a less-invasive therapy.WeakUse low-intensity shockwave treatment (Li-SWT) with/without PDE5Is in patientswith mild vasculogenic ED;as an alternative therapy in well-informed patients who do not wish to have or are not suitable for oral vasoactive therapy;who are vasculogenic ED patients who are poor responders to PDE5IsWeakUse vacuum erection devices in well-informed patients requesting non-invasive, drug-free management of ED.WeakImplant a penile prosthesis if other treatments fail or depending upon patient preference. Patients should be fully informed of the benefits and harms associated with the procedure.StrongStart pro-erectile treatments at the earliest opportunity after radical prostatectomy/pelvic surgery and other curative treatments for PCa.Weak
