5.5. Imaging for diagnosis and staging. Radiological imaging of urethral carcinoma aims to assess local staging and to detect lymphatic and distant metastatic spread. In a recent multicentre study, the accuracy of cross-sectional imaging for clinical tumour and nodal staging predicting final pathological staging was found to be 72.9% and 70.6%, respectively [43]. Imaging work-up should include computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen and pelvis for staging, including CT urography for urothelial evaluation. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used to evaluate tumour location and size, as well as local tumour extent and presence of regional LN metastases, focusing in particular on inguinal and pelvic LNs [44-48]. For local staging, there is evidence that MRI is an accurate tool for monitoring tumour response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and evaluating the extent of local disease prior to exenterative surgery [49]. 18F-Fluorodeoxglucose positron emission tomography/MRI has shown to improve the diagnostic evaluation in patients with metastatic disease [50].
