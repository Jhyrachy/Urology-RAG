4.1.4.1.1. Addressing associated medical co-morbidities. Lower urinary tract symptoms, especially in elderly patients, are associated with multiple co-morbid conditions including: cardiac failure;chronic renal failure;diabetes;chronic obstructive pulmonary disease;neurological disease;general cognitive impairment;sleep disturbances, e.g., sleep apnoea;depression;metabolic syndrome. If a change in co-morbidity or a new treatment for any associated co-morbidity has been linked to a deterioration in LUTS then this should be reviewed. One study involving middle-aged women with type 1 diabetes mellitus showed that 10% had UUI. The study showed no correlation between early intensive insulin treatment of type 1 diabetes mellitus vs. conventional insulin treatment and the occurrence of UUI. The same study found no difference in the prevalence of UI in these patients later in their lives [116].
