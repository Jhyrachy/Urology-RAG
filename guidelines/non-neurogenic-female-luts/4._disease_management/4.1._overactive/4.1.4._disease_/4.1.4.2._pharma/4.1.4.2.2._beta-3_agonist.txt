4.1.4.2.2. Beta-3 Agonists. Beta-3 adrenoceptors are the predominant beta receptors expressed on detrusor smooth muscle cells and their stimulation is thought to induce detrusor relaxation. Mirabegron was the first clinically available beta-3 agonist. Vibegron is another beta-3 agonist commercially available in some countries. Mirabegron has undergone evaluation in industry-sponsored phase II and III trials [182-185]. Three SRs assessing the clinical effectiveness of mirabegron [182,183,186] reported that mirabegron at doses of 25, 50 and 100 mg results in significantly greater reduction in UI episodes, urgency episodes and micturition frequency than placebo, with no difference in the rate of common adverse events [183]. The dry rates in most of these trials are 35–40% for placebo and 43–50% for mirabegron. In all trials the significant differences were consistent only for improvement but not for cure of UI. Similar improvements in the frequency of UI episodes and micturition frequency were found whether or not patients had previously tried anticholinergic agents. The most common adverse events in the mirabegron groups were hypertension (7.3%), nasopharyngitis (3.4%) and UTI (3%), with the overall rate similar to that with placebo [182,185,187]. A SR with meta-analysis of data pooled from three RCTs comparing vibegron (75 mg or 100 mg) with placebo in 2,120 patients with OAB revealed significant improvement of urgency episodes and UUI episodes and mean voided volume associated with vibegron [188]. The review also reported that vibegron showed a favourable safety profile. Another SR that included three high-quality RCTs compared vibegron with anticholinergic monotherapy (imidafenacin and tolterodine) concluding similar efficacy in terms of improvements in mean number of micturitions, urgency and UUI, but with less dry mouth [189].
