4.4.1. epidemiology, aetiology, pathophysiology. 4.4.1.1. epidemiology underactive bladder entity remains difficult characterise, partly corresponding urodynamic correlate, du, remains loosely defined, leading significant variability diagnostic criteria across research studies significant overlap symptoms conditions. consequence variable definition, reported prevalence also varies ranges 12-45% women, increased prevalence seen age institutionalised elderly women . several studies demonstrated similar prevalence rates du ambulatory setting around12–19% [458-460]. would expected, voiding symptoms consistent uab higher. large cross-sectional, population-based internet survey conducted usa, uk sweden including 15,861 women aged > 40 years, 20.1% weak flow, 27.4% incomplete bladder emptying 38.3% terminal dribbling . filling du voiding phase urodynamic studies co-exist (formerly known detrusor hyperactivity impaired contractility [dhic]) one study showed prevalence finding 30% elderly women . 4.4.1.2. aetiology presence du diverse clinical groups suggests multifactorial aetiology . idiopathic du probably partly age-dependent decrease detrusor contractility identifiable causes, young women also du. many secondary causes du, including neurogenic (e.g., multiple sclerosis, multiple systemic atrophy, spinal cord injury, spina bifida, parkinson’s disease, hydrocephalus, transverse myelitis, stroke, guillain–barré syndrome, diabetes mellitus, pelvic nerve injury), myogenic (prolonged bladder overdistension, diabetes mellitus, boo) iatrogenic (pelvic surgery) causes . 4.4.1.3. pathophysiology many pathways involved normal detrusor contraction, different possible sites dysfunction variety mechanisms involved uab (see figure 1): central circuits centres (prefrontal cortex, periaqueductal gray, pontine micturition centre hypothalamus): failure integration processing.efferent pathways (sacral cord, sacral nerves, pelvic nerves, postganglionic neurons): impaired detrusor activation.afferent pathways (peripheral afferent nerves, anterolateral white column, posterior column): early termination voiding reflex.muscle (detrusor myocytes extracellular matrix): loss intrinsic contractility. different aetiologies share common pathophysiological mechanisms: example, diabetes mellitus affects mainly afferent pathways detrusor muscle; neurogenic diseases affect central circuits efferent/afferent pathways. figure 1: management treatment women presenting urinary incontinence, site dysfunction, major aetiological factors, mechanisms*figure reproduced permission publisher, osman n. et al.
