4.4. The International Germ Cell Cancer Collaborative Group (IGCCCG) classification for the prognostic risk groups of metastatic germ cell cancer. The 1997 IGCCCG defined a prognostic risk-factor system for metastatic GCT based on identification of clinically independent adverse factors [45]. The classification has been revalidated on a contemporary cohort of metastatic TGCT treated with cisplatin/etoposide based first-line chemotherapy [46]. Compared to the 1997 figures, the five-year progression-free survival (PFS) of NSGCT patients was unchanged for good- and intermediate-risk, but significantly improved for poor-risk patients (from 41% to 54%). The five-year overall survival (OS) was substantially better for all groups. In addition to the traditional components of the IGCCCG risk-prognostic groups previously described, older age (linear association) and lung metastases were confirmed as negative factors for PFS [46]. For SGCT, revalidation of the IGCCCG classification showed that the five-year PFS increased to 89% and 79% in good- and intermediate-risk patients with corresponding OS rates of 95% and 88%. Testicular lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) over 2.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) was identified as a possible adverse prognostic factor in regard to reduced three-year PFS, however overall three-year survival was not affected [47].
