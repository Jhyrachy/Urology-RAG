6.2. Metastatic germ cell tumours. The first-line treatment of metastatic GCTs depends on: I. the histology of the primary tumour;II. prognostic groups as defined by the IGCCCG (Table 4) [45];III. serum tumour marker decline at the end of the first cycle of chemotherapy in poor-prognosis patients. In relapsed patients, a prognostic score has been developed including response to first-line therapy which can be used to estimate patient outcome following salvage chemotherapy [149].
