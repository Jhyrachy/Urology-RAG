4.3. Tumour grade. In 2004 and 2016, the WHO and the International Society of Urological Pathology published a new histological classification of UCs which provides a different patient stratification between individual categories compared to the older 1973 WHO classification [86,87]. In 2022, an update of the 2004/2016 WHO grading classification was published without major changes [88]. These guidelines are still based on both the 1973 and 2004/2016 WHO classifications since most published data use the 1973 classification [83].
