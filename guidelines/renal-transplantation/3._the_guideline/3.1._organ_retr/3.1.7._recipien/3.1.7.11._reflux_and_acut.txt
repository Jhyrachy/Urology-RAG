3.1.7.11. Reflux and acute pyelonephritis. The frequency of vesicoureteral reflux is between 1-86% [201,216]. Acute graft pyelonephritis occurs in 13% of graft recipients. Patients with lower tract urinary infections and cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection present a higher risk of acute graft pyelonephritis [217]. Endoscopic injection of dextranomer/hyaluronic acid copolymer may be the first approach for treatment of vesicoureteral reflux associated with acute pyelonephritis, with a success rate ranging from 57.9% after the first injection to 78.9% after the second injection [218]. Ureteral re-implantation or pyelo-ureterostomy with the native ureter is a viable second treatment option [213].
