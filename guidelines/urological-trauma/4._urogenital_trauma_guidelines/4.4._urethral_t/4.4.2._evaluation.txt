4.4.2. Evaluation. 4.4.2.1. Clinical signs Blood at the meatus is the cardinal sign, but the absence of it doesn’t rule out a urethral injury [184,254]. Inability to void (with a palpable distended bladder) is another classic sign and is often associated with a complete rupture [254,255]. Haematuria and pain on urination may be present in incomplete ruptures. Urinary extravasation and bleeding may result in scrotal, penile and/or perineal swelling and ecchymosis, depending on the location and extent of the trauma. The presentation of these clinical symptoms may be delayed (> 1 hour) [255]. Rectal examination should always be done to exclude an associated rectal injury (up to 5% of cases) and may reveal a ‘high-riding’ prostate, which is an unreliable finding [184,255]. Failure to detect a rectal injury can cause significant morbidity and even mortality. A rectal injury is suggested by blood on the examining finger and/or a palpable laceration [184]. Another sign of urethral injury is difficulty or inability to pass a urethral catheter [184,255]. A female urethral injury should be suspected from the combination of a (unstable) pelvic fracture with blood at the vaginal introitus, vaginal laceration, haematuria, urethrorrhagia, labial swelling, urinary retention, or difficulties passing a urethral catheter [184,257]. Vaginal examination is indicated to assess vaginal lacerations [184,257]. 4.4.2.2. Urethrography Retrograde urethrography (RUG) is the standard in the early evaluation of a male urethral injury [184,262] and is conducted by injecting 20-30 mL of contrast material while occluding the meatus. Films should be taken in a 30° oblique position. In patients with PFUI, it is important to move the X-ray beam to the 30° angle rather than the patient [254]. In an unstable patient, RUG should be postponed until the patient has been stabilised [184,192]. During RUG, any extravasation outside the urethra is pathognomonic for urethral injury [255]. A typical image for incomplete rupture shows extravasation from the urethra which occurs while the bladder is still filling. A complete rupture is suggested by massive extravasation without bladder filling [254]. Although RUG is able to reliably identify the site of injury (anterior vs. posterior), the distinction between a complete and partial rupture is not always clear [254,263]. Therefore, any proposed classification system based on RUG is not reliable [254,263]. In females, the short urethra and vulvar oedema makes adequate urethrography nearly impossible [264]. Prior to deferred treatment, a combination of RUG and antegrade cysto-urethrography is the standard to evaluate site and extent of the urethral stenosis, and to evaluate the competence of the bladder neck [254]. 4.4.2.3. Cysto-urethroscopy Flexible cysto-urethroscopy is a valuable alternative to diagnose an acute urethral injury and may distinguish between complete and partial rupture [262]. Flexible cysto-urethroscopy is preferred to RUG in suspected penile fracture-associated urethral injury as RUG is associated with a high false-negative rate [265,266]. In females, where the short urethra often precludes adequate radiological visualisation, cysto-urethroscopy and vaginoscopy are the diagnostic modalities of choice [184,260]. If, prior to deferred treatment, the competence of the bladder neck is not clear upon antegrade cysto-urethrography, a suprapubic cystoscopy is advised [254]. 4.4.2.4. Ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging In the acute phase, US scanning is used for guiding the placement of a suprapubic catheter [254]. In complex PFUIs, MRI before deferred treatment provides valuable additional information, which can help to determine the most appropriate surgical strategy [267]. This information includes a better estimation of the length of the distraction defect, degree of prostatic displacement and presence/absence of a false passage [267].
