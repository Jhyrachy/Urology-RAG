4.6.1. epidemiology, aetiology, pathophysiology. prevalence nocturia varies according age 4–18% women aged 20–40 years experiencing > 2episodes per night, compared 28–62% women aged > 70 years . study 1,000 community-dwelling older adults, female nocturia associated older age, african american race, history ui, lower limb oedema hypertension . report > 5,000 adults aged 30–79 years identified around 28% nocturia found additional correlates increased cardiac disease, type 2 diabetes, diuretic use . sr meta-analysis moderate certainty evidence based grade approach, demonstrated higher incidence nocturia among hypertensive patients strongly associated (1.2 1.3-fold) among black asian women, unrelated age bmi status . another sr moderate certainty evidence based grade approach showed nocturia associated 1.2-fold increased risk falls possibly approximately 1.3-fold increased risk fractures . another sr meta-analysis concluded nocturia probably associated ~1.3-fold increased risk death . aetiology nocturia multifactorial include urological non-urological causes. urological conditions may exhibit nocturia significant symptom include oab syndrome, boo, du, dysfunctional voiding. non-urological causes include 24-hour polyuria (which includes nocturnal polyuria), congestive heart failure, sleep apnoea, restless leg syndrome, peripheral vascular disease, sleep disorders, night-time food ingestion, dependent oedema, excessive fluid intake . given varied aetiology symptom, range possible pathophysiological mechanisms, including: (1) 24-hour polyuria (e.g., diabetes mellitus, primary polydipsia, diabetes insipidus); (2) nocturnal polyuria (e.g., behavioural, peripheral oedema, obstructive sleep apnoea, glycosuria, hormonal abnormalities cardiac dysfunction ); (3) diminished bladder capacity (e.g., oab syndrome/do, pfm dysfunction, boo, pharmaceuticals, lut calculi tumours, neurological bladder dysfunction); (4) primary secondary sleep disorders . postmenopausal women relative deficiency endogenous oestrogen production thought exacerbate major pathophysiological mechanisms may underlie nocturia .
