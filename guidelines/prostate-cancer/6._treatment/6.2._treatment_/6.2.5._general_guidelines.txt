6.2.5. General guidelines for the treatment of prostate cancer*. RecommendationsStrength ratingOffer a watchful waiting (WW) policy to asymptomatic patients with clinically localised disease and with a life expectancy < ten years (based on comorbidities and age).StrongNo active treatment modality has shown superiority over any other active management options or deferred active treatment in terms of overall- and PCa-specific survival for clinically localised low/intermediate-risk disease.StrongInform patients that all local treatments have side effects.StrongSurgical treatmentInform patients that no surgical approach (open-, laparoscopic- or robotic RP) has clearly shown superiority in terms of functional or oncological results.WeakConsider avoiding nerve-sparing surgery when there is a risk of ipsilateral ex-tra-capsular extension (based on cT stage, ISUP grade group, magnetic reso-nance imaging, or with this information combined in a nomogram).WeakIn patients undergoing a lymph node dissection you should perform an extended PLND.StrongDo not offer neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy before surgery.StrongRadiotherapeutic treatmentOffer intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) or volumetric arc radiation therapy (VMAT) plus image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) for definitive treatment of PCa by external-beam radiation therapy.StrongOffer moderate hypofractionation (HFX) with IMRT/VMAT plus IGRT to the prostate to patients with localised disease (60 Gy/20 fractions in 4 weeks or 70 Gy/28 fractions in 6 weeks).StrongOffer low-dose rate (LDR) brachytherapy monotherapy to patients with good urinary function and NCCN favourable intermediate-risk disease.StrongOffer LDR or high-dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy boost combined with IMRT/VMAT plus IGRT to patients with good urinary function and NCCN unfa-vourable intermediate-risk or high-risk disease and/or locally-advanced disease.WeakActive therapeutic options outside surgery or radiotherapyOffer focal therapy with HIFU or cryotherapy within a clinical trial or prospective registry.Strong *All recommendations are based on conventional imaging with isotope bone scan and CT/MR abdomen/pelvis. Summary of evidenceLEThe AS strategy should be based on PSA (at least once every six months), serial DRE (at least once yearly) and repeated biopsy. Serial DRE may be omitted if MRI is stable.3Serial MRI can improve the detection of aggressive cancers during AS.A progression on MRI mandates a repeat biopsy before a change in treatment strategy.A stationary MRI does not make repeat biopsy superfluous (patients with low-risk tumour and a stable PSA-D < 0.15 may be excepted). RecommendationsStrength ratingBase the strategy of active surveillance (AS) on a strict protocol including digital rectal examination (at least once yearly), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) (at least once every six months) and repeated biopsy every 2 to 3 years.StrongPatients with a low risk PCa, a stable MRI (PRECISE 3) and a stable, low PSA density(< 0.15) may be excused from repeat biopsy.WeakPerform magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and repeat biopsy if PSA is rising (PSA-doubling time < 3 years).StrongBase change in treatment on biopsy progression, not on progression on MRI and/or PSA.WeakRe-classify patients with low-volume ISUP grade group 2 disease included in AS protocols,if repeat non-MRI-based systematic biopsies performed during monitoring reveal > 3 positive cores or maximum core involvement > 50%/core of ISUP grade group 2 disease.Weak
