5.6.2. Modifiable risk factors. Erectile dysfunction may be associated with modifiable or reversible risk factors, including lifestyle or drug-related factors [342]. These factors may be modified either before, or at the same time as, specific therapies are used. Likewise, ED may be associated with concomitant and underlying conditions (e.g., endocrine disorders and metabolic disorders such as diabetes, and some cardiovascular problems such as hypertension) which should always be well-controlled as the first step of any ED treatment [343]. Overall, several studies have shown that lifestyle modifications including physical activity, weight loss and treatment for CVD risk factors and lipid-lowering therapy with statins may be of help in improving sexual function in men with ED [257,342,344-349].
