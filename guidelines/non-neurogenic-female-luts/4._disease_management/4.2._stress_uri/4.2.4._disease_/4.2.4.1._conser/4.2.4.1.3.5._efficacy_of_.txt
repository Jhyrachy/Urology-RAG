4.2.4.1.3.5. Efficacy of Pelvic floor muscle training in elderly women. There have been few RCTs on conservative treatment of SUI in elderly women (> 65 years) and many of the studies combined different modalities, such as BT, lifestyle modifications and PFMT [331]. Some of the studies on PFMT and SUI in the general population have included women > 65 years and PFMT seems to be equally effective in elderly women. A SR on conservative management included 23 trials, with nine of moderate-to-high methodological quality and concluded that PFMT in combination with physical training was effective in reducing UI and improving QoL [332]. Prompted voiding and toileting assistance with functional exercise reduced UI. Other behavioural interventions such as night-time prompted voiding and waking routine had no effect on UI reduction. The most recent ICI consensus publication stated that although there are limited studies of PFMT on UI in frail elderly populations, age and frailty alone should not preclude the use of PFMT in appropriate patients with sufficient cognition to participate [331]. More high-quality RCTs, both in frail and healthy older women (> 80 years of age) are needed.
