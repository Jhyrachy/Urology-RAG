3.2.2. Prevalence. 3.2.2.1. Primary prostate pain syndrome There is only limited information on the true prevalence of PPPS in the population. As a result of significant overlap of symptoms with other conditions (e.g., benign prostatic enlargement and PBPS), purely symptom based case definitions may not reflect the true prevalence of PPPS [86,87]. In the literature, population-based prevalence of prostatitis symptoms ranges from 2.2-14.2% [88,89]. The risk of prostatitis increases with age (men aged 50-59 years have a 3.1-fold greater risk than those aged 20-39 years). 3.2.2.2. Primary bladder pain syndrome Reports of PBPS prevalence have varied greatly, along with the diagnostic criteria and populations studied. Recent reports range from 0.06-20% [90-96]. There is a female predominance of about 10:1 [94] but possibly no difference in race or ethnicity [86,97,98]. The relative proportions of Hunner’s lesion and non-lesion disease are unclear. Incidence in studies has ranged from 5-50% [99-102]. There is increasing evidence that children under eighteen may also be affected, although prevalence figures are low; therefore, PBPS cannot be excluded on the basis of age [103]. 3.2.2.3. Sexual pain syndrome In the 1980s, an association between chronic pelvic pain and sexual dysfunction was postulated. In a review the relationship between Primary Prostate Pain Syndrome and health status, with influence on sexual activity, was addressed [104]. In a Chinese study of men with chronic pelvic pain, 1,768 males completed the questionnaires. The overall prevalence of sexual dysfunction was 49%. Erectile dysfunction (ED) is the most investigated sexual dysfunction in PPPS patients. The reported prevalence of ED ranges from 15.1-48%, varying with evaluation tools and populations [105,106]. Erectile dysfunction was prevalent in 27.4% of Italian men aged 25-50 [107], 15.2% among Turkish men (significantly higher than in the control group) [108] and 43% among Finnish men with PPPS [109]. The prevalence of ED was found to be higher in young men with PPPS than in the general population. A significant correlation between “chronic prostatitis”, chronic pelvic pain symptoms (measured by NIH-CPSI) and ED (measured by International Index of Erectile Function [IIEF]) was confirmed while other studies using the same questionnaires were not able to confirm such a correlation [74,110]. Some studies also report ejaculatory dysfunction, mainly premature ejaculation [105,106,111,112]. In community-based studies in the UK [113], New Zealand [114] and Australia [115], a substantially larger proportion of the women with chronic pelvic pain reported dyspareunia (varying between 29-42%) than women without chronic pelvic pain (varying between 11-14%). Only a few studies have investigated sexual problems within clinical populations [116]. Another study showed that all of the sexual function domains (desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction, and pain) were significantly lower in women with chronic pelvic pain than in women without chronic pelvic pain [116]. One study of patients enrolled in chronic pain treatment programs in England has reported that 73% had pain-related sexual problems [117]. 3.2.2.4. Myofascial pain syndromes The relationship between muscular dysfunction (especially over-activity) and pelvic pain has been found in several studies [118]. Rectal pain treated with pelvic floor muscle therapy is only relieved when patients learn to relax their pelvic floor muscles [119,120]. The vast majority (92.2%) of men visiting a tertiary centre for pelvic pain had dysfunction of the pelvic floor muscles. This finding was true regardless of evidence of inflammation (prostatitis or cystitis) [121]. This relationship has been found in chronic prostatitis [122], PBPS [123] and vulvar pain [124]. Dysfunction of the pelvic floor directly affects function of the pelvic viscera and vice versa. Both systems can act as the primary signal to the spinal cord, with a cascade of reactions ascending to the CNS as a result. The muscle itself ends up shortened, leading to restrictions even in a relaxed state.
