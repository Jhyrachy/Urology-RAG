7.3.2. Distant metastases. 7.3.2.1. Systemic treatments - First-line setting 7.3.2.1.1. Enfortumab vedotin + pembrolizumab combination therapy For more than 23 years despite multiple attempts with new agents and/or combinations of treatments, platinum-based chemotherapy remained standard of care for previously untreated advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer. In October 2023, the landscape changed dramatically with the EV302 phase III randomised multi-centre study. This compared the combination of the nectin 4 directed antibody-drug conjugate enfortumab vedotin with the check point inhibitor pembrolizumab, (EV+P) with platinum based combination chemotherapy (gemcitabine-cisplatin or gemcitabine -carboplatin. See table 2 for definition of cisplatin eligibility). This study showed significant improvement in both PFS ( HR 0.45 (0.38-0.54 ) and OS (HR 0.47 (0.38-0.58) with RR of 68% (versus 44%) and CR 29% . OS benefit was seen across sub groups regardless of cisplatin eligibility. The most common grade 3 or above TRAE of special interest included skin reactions (15.5%) , peripheral neuropathy (6.8%) and hyperglycaemia (6.1%). The proportion of UTUC patients in this study is not yet known. Sequencing of treatment after Ev+Pembro is currently unclear and later line treatments will depend upon what agents the patient has previously received (Figure 7.3). 7.3.2.1.2. Patients ineligible for EV+Pembro and fit for cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy Upper tract UC and urothelial BC both respond to systemic platinum-based chemotherapy. Eligibility to platinum-based chemotherapy in the metastatic setting is based on the same criteria outlined in Table 2. A retrospective analysis of three RCTs showed that primary tumour location in the lower- or upper urinary tract had no impact on progression-free survival (PFS) or OS in patients with locally-advanced or metastatic UC treated with platinum-based combination chemotherapy [293]. Therefore, cisplatin-containing combination chemotherapy is the standard treatment for advanced or metastatic UTUC ineligible for EV + Pembro [2]. A number of cisplatin-containing chemotherapy regimens have proven efficacy although gemcitabine and cisplatin are the most widely used. The use of cisplatin-based chemotherapy is widely considered in patients with eGFR > 45 mL/min [293]. The efficacy of immunotherapy using PD1 or PD-L1 inhibitors has been evaluated in the first-line setting for the treatment of cisplatin/carboplatin-fit patients with metastatic UC, including those with UTUC [294]. First-line immune checkpoint inhibitors or the combination of platinum-based chemotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors have not previously resulted in positive significant survival advantages were thus not previously recommended [295-297]. These studies included both cisplatin and carboplatin combinations. A phase III RCT in advanced/metastatic urothelial cancer has now shown an overall benefit from the addition of nivolumab to chemotherapy (gemcitabine-cisplatin). Median OS was improved (21.7 months v 18.9 months HR 0.78 (0.63-0.96) as well as median PFS (7.9 months versus 7.6 months HR 0.72 (0.59-0.88). Objective RR were 57.6% compared with 43.1 % for chemotherapy alone [298]. Although there is no sub-group analysis based on tumour position in this study, 12.6% of patients had UTUC. 7.3.2.1.3. Patients ineligible for Ev+Pembro and unfit for cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy Carboplatin-based chemotherapy is recommended in patients unfit for cisplatin [2]. Carboplatin with gemcitabine is the preferred regimen [299], irrespective of PDL-1 status. In a recent critical re-analysis of RCTs comparing OS after cisplatin vs. carboplatin-based regimens in advanced UC, cisplatin conferred a minor OS benefit compared to carboplatin [300]. 7.3.2.1.4. Maintenance therapy after first-line platinum-based chemotherapy Maintenance avelumab is recommended in patients with complete/partial response or stable disease after 4–6 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy, given in the first line setting only. Data from a phase III RCT showed that the use of avelumab maintenance therapy after 4 to 6 cycles of gemcitabine plus cisplatin or carboplatin (started within 10 weeks of completion of first-line platinum-based chemotherapy) significantly prolonged OS as compared to best supportive care alone in those patients with advanced or metastatic UC who did not experience disease progression during, or responded to, first-line chemotherapy (HR: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.56–0.86) [290,301]. An increase in median OS from 14 to 21 months was observed with avelumab. Although no subgroup analysis based on tumour location was available in this study, almost 30% of the included patients had UTUC. Similarly, in a phase II study comprising 108 patients with metastatic UC achieving at least stable disease on first-line platinum-based chemotherapy, maintenance pembrolizumab improved PFS compared to placebo (5.4 vs. 3.0 months) [302]. 7.3.2.1.5. Patients unfit for any combination therapy Pembrolizumab or atezolizumab are alternative choices for patients who are PD-L1 positive and not eligible/ fit for platinum-based chemotherapy. In a single-arm phase II trial (n = 370) of cisplatin-ineligible UC, pembrolizumab monotherapy was associated with an objective response rate of 26% in 69 metastatic UTUC patients [303]. In the overall cohort, a PD-L1 expression of 10% was associated with a greater response rate to pembrolizumab. Treatment-related toxicity was in line with previous studies. In a single-arm phase II trial (n = 119) of cisplatin-ineligible UC, atezolizumab monotherapy was associated with an objective response rate of 39% in 33 (28%) metastatic UTUC patients [304]. Median OS in the overall cohort was 15.9 months and treatment-related toxicity was in line with previous studies [296]. 7.3.2.2. Systemic treatments - later line setting Subsequent treatments depend on the type of treatment given in the first line setting. 7.3.2.2.1. Platinum based chemotherapy Platinum based chemotherapy should be the second line treatment of choice if not received in the first line setting. No data supports the use of maintenance avelumab outside of the first line setting. 7.3.2.2.2. Immunotherapy A phase III RCT including 542 patients who received prior platinum-based chemotherapy for advanced UC showed that pembrolizumab decreased the risk of death compared to second-line chemotherapy (the investigator’s choice of paclitaxel, docetaxel, or vinflunine); median OS: 10.3 months for pembrolizumab and 7.4 months for chemotherapy (HR: 0.73; 95% CI: 0.59–0.91) [305]. Responses were more frequent and durable for pembrolizumab compared to chemotherapy (21% vs. 11%). In the UTUC subgroup (n = 75/13.8%), the OS benefit seemed larger (50%). The IMVigor211 trial explored atezolizumab in PD-L1-positive tumours in patients with tumours which relapsed after platinum-based chemotherapy; it failed to show a significant OS advantage of atezolizumab compared to second-line chemotherapy [306]. Other immunotherapies such as nivolumab [307], avelumab [308,309] and durvalumab [310] have shown objective response rates ranging from 17.8% [310] to 19.6% [307] and median OS ranging from 7.7 months to 18.2 months in patients with platinum-resistant metastatic UC. These results were obtained from single- arm phase I or II trials only and the number of UTUC patients included in these studies was only specified for avelumab (n = 7/15.9%) without any subgroup analysis based on primary tumour location [309]. The immunotherapy combination of nivolumab plus ipilimumab has shown significant anti-tumour activity with objective response rate up to 38% in a phase I/II multicentre trial including 78 patients with metastatic UC experiencing disease progression after platinum-based chemotherapy [311]. Although UTUC patients were included in this trial, no subgroup analysis was available. Other immunotherapy combinations may be effective in the second-line setting but data are currently limited [312]. 7.3.2.2.3. Novel agents Fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFR) inhibition Erdafitinib, a pan-FGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor of FGFR1–4, was associated with a 40% radiological response rate according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) in a phase II trial of 99 patients with locally-advanced or metastatic UC who progressed after first-line chemotherapy and harboured a FGFR DNA genomic alterations (FGFR2/3 fusions or FGFR3 mutations) [313]. This study included 23 UTUC patients with visceral metastases showing a 43% radiological response rate. The subsequent phase III Thor trial randomised 266 patients with advanced UC who had had similar mutations and had experienced disease progression after 1-2 lines of previous treatment, to treatment with either erdafitinib or investigators choice of chemotherapy (vinfunine or docetaxel). Significant improvements in median OS, (4.3 months; HR 0.64;CI 0.47-0.88), PFS 2.9 months (58; CI 0.44-0.78) and a 36% risk reduction in death were observed. 33.5 % of patient in this study had UTUC [314]. As the rate of activating alterations of FGFR3 is higher in UTUC than in bladder cancer [315] a potentially greater impact of FGR3 targeting agents is anticipated. UTUC patients should be tested for FGFR alterations (FGFR2/3 mutations or FGFR3 fusions) prior to erdafitinib treatment. Antibody drug conjugates (ADC) A phase II study enrolled 89 patients (of whom 43% had UTUC) with cisplatin-unfit metastatic UC experiencing disease progression after therapy with PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors. All patients received the antibody–drug conjugate enfortumab vedotin. The objective radiological response rate (RECIST) was 52% of which 20% of patients achieved complete response [316]. In a phase III trial of enfortumab vedotin for the treatment of patients with locally- advanced or metastatic UC who had previously received platinum-containing chemotherapy and had disease progression during or after treatment with a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor, enfortumab vedotin significantly prolonged survival as compared to standard chemotherapy (median OS 12.88 vs. 8.97 months) [317]. In an open-label phase II trial a total of 108 patients with metastatic UC who progressed after platinum- based chemotherapy and checkpoint inhibitors were treated with the antibody-drug conjugate sacituzumab govitecan. The objective radiological response rate was 27%, with median duration of response of 7.2 months, median PFS of 5.4 months and median OS of 10.9 months. However, the proportion of patients with UTUC was not mentioned in the publication [318]. A pre-planned subgroup analysis from the phase III RANGE trial assessed the impact on outcomes and safety of ramucirumab added to docetaxel after disease progression on both platinum-based chemotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors [319]. Median PFS was 3.15 months on ramucirumab/docetaxel vs. 2.73 months on placebo/docetaxel (HR: 0.786; 95% CI: 0.404–1.528, p = 0.4877). This trend for ramucirumab benefit occurred despite the ramucirumab arm having a higher percentage of patients with poorer prognosis. However, these findings need confirmation by further studies, as this analysis is limited by patient numbers and an imbalance in the treatment arms. 7.3.2.3. Surgery 7.3.2.3.1. Radical nephroureterectomy Data regarding RNU in the metastatic setting are lacking with mainly retrospective observational studies [320-322]. Although evidence remains very limited, RNU may be associated with CSS [321,323,324] and OS benefit in selected patients, especially those fit enough to receive cisplatin-based chemotherapy [320,321]. It is noteworthy that these benefits may be limited to those patients with only one metastatic site [321]. Nonetheless, given the high risk of bias of the observational studies addressing RNU for metastatic UTUC, indications for RNU in this setting should mainly be reserved for palliative patients, aimed at controlling symptomatic disease [26,124]. 7.3.2.3.2. Metastasectomy There is no UTUC-specific study supporting the role of metastasectomy in patients with advanced disease. Reports suggesting that resection of metastatic lesions could be safe and oncologically beneficial in selected patients should be interpreted with caution [325-329]. In the absence of data from RCTs, patients should be evaluated on an individual basis and the decision to perform a metastasectomy (surgically) should be made following a shared decision-making process with the patient.
