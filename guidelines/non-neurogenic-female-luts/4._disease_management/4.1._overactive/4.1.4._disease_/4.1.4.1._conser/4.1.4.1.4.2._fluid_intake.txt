4.1.4.1.4.2. Fluid intake. Modification of fluid intake, particularly restriction, is a strategy commonly used by people with OAB. Any advice on fluid intake given by health care practitioners (HCPs) should be based on 24-hour fluid intake and urine output measurements as retrieved from the bladder diary. From a general health point of view, it should be advised that fluid intake should be sufficient to avoid thirst and that an abnormally low or high 24-hour urine output should be investigated. The few published RCTs involving women provide inconsistent evidence [131-133]. In most studies, the instructions for fluid intake were individualised and it was difficult to assess participant adherence. An RCT showed that a reduction in fluid intake by 25% improved symptoms in patients with OAB but did not improve UI [133]. Personalised fluid advice compared to generic advice made no difference to continence outcomes in people receiving anticholinergics for OAB, according to an RCT comparing drug therapy alone to drug therapy with behavioural advice [134]. Patients should be warned of the potential consequences of fluid restriction such as worsening of constipation or development of UTI.
