3.4. Urinalysis and urinary tract infection. Reagent strip (dipstick) urinalysis may indicate proteinuria, haematuria or glycosuria, or suggest UTI requiring further assessment. Please refer to the Urological Infections Guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of UTI [17]. Urine dipstick testing is a useful adjunct to clinical evaluation in patients in whom urinary symptoms are suspected to be due to UTI. Urinalysis negative for nitrite and leukocyte esterase may exclude bacteriuria in women with LUTS [45], and should be included, with urine culture when necessary, in the evaluation of all patients with LUTS. Urinary incontinence or worsening of LUTS may occur during UTI [46] and existing UI may worsen [47]. The rate and severity of UI were unchanged after eradication of asymptomatic bacteriuria in nursing home residents [48]. 3.4.1. Summary of evidence and recommendations for urinalysis Summary of evidenceLEUrinalysis negative for nitrite and leukocyte esterase may exclude bacteriuria in women with LUTS.3Urinary incontinence may be a symptom during UTI, and LUTS may increase during UTI.3The presence of UTI worsens existing symptoms of UI.3Elderly nursing home patients with UI do not benefit from treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria.2 RecommendationsStrength ratingPerform urinalysis as a part of the initial assessment of patients with LUTS.StrongIf an urinary tract infection is present with LUTS, reassess the patient after treatment.StrongDo not routinely treat asymptomatic bacteriuria in elderly patients with the aim of improving UI.Strong
