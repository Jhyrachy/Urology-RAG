4.1. Tumour, Node, Metastasis (UICC/TNM) staging system. In men and women, urethral carcinoma is classified according to the 8th edition of the TNM classification [7] (Table 4.1). It should be noted that there is a separate TNM staging system for prostatic UC [7]. Of note, for cancers occurring in the urethral diverticulum, stage T2 is not applicable as urethral diverticula are lacking periurethral muscle [32].
