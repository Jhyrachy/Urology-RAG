4.6. Nocturia. Nocturia was defined by the ICS in 2002 as “the complaint that the individual has to wake at night one or more times to void” and quantified in an updated document in 2019 as “the number of times an individual passes urine during their main sleep period, from the time they have fallen asleep up to the intention to rise from that period” [581]. The EAU Guidelines Panel on Urinary Incontinence conducted a SR on nocturia in women [582]. The search covered evidence up to 2017 and this review was updated with a scoping search in 2020.
