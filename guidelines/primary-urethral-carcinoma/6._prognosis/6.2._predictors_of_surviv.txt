6.2. Predictors of survival in primary urethral carcinoma. Previous series reported no substantial difference in 5-year OS rates between the sexes [8,30,59], whereas in a recent SEER analysis female patients showed higher stage disease and 5-year CSM despite higher use of multimodal therapy [10,60]. Prognostic factors of worse survival in patients with primary urethral carcinoma are: advanced age (> 65 years) and black race [8,30,60,61];higher stage, grade, nodal involvement [52,62] and metastasis [28];increased tumour size and proximal tumour location [28];underlying (non-urothelial or unconventional) histology [8,28,31,61-64];presence of concomitant bladder cancer [40];extent of surgical treatment and treatment modality [28,61,62];treatment in academic centres [65];location of recurrence (urethral vs. non-urethral) [66]. Some limitations have to be considered when interpreting these results as the number of patients included in most studies were low [63].
