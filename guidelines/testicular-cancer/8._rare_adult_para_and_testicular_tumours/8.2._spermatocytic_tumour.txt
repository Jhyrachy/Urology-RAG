8.2. Spermatocytic Tumours. Spermatocytic tumours are GCTs unrelated to GCNIS. They may show a unique amplification of chromosome 9 corresponding to the DMRT1 gene and are never associated with other forms of germ cell tumours [290]. Spermatocytic tumours are rare, occur exclusively in the testis and do not normally show elevated tumour markers [290]. Previously named “spermatocytic seminomas” they have been recently reclassified as spermatocytic tumours [290]. As those tumours cannot be differentiated from seminoma GCT by FSE, radical orchiectomy is the standard treatment option. Outcomes after testis-sparing surgery or adjuvant treatment is unknown and therefore not recommended [291]. Metastatic disease is very rare, usually associated with ‘sarcomatoid change’ and typically presents at or soon after initial diagnosis with limited survival [291].
