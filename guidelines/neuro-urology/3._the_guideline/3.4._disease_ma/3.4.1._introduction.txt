3.4.1. Introduction. The primary aims for treatment of neuro-urological symptoms, and their priorities, are [129,130]: protection of the UUT;achievement (or maintenance) of urinary continence;restoration of LUT function;improvement of the patient’s QoL. Further considerations are the patient’s disability, cognition, social support, caregiver support, cost-effectiveness, technical complexity and possible complications [134]. Historically, renal failure was the main mortality factor in SCI patients who survived the trauma [135,136]. Keeping the detrusor pressure during both the filling and voiding phases within safe limits significantly reduces the mortality from urological causes in these patients [137-139] and has consequently become the top priority in the treatment of patients with neuro-urological symptoms [133,134]. In patients with high detrusor pressure during the filling phase (NDO, low bladder compliance), treatment is aimed primarily at conversion of an overactive, high-pressure bladder into a low-pressure reservoir despite the resulting residual urine [133]. Reduction of the detrusor pressure contributes to urinary continence, and consequently to social rehabilitation and QoL. It is also critical for preventing UTIs [140,141]. However, complete continence cannot always be obtained.
