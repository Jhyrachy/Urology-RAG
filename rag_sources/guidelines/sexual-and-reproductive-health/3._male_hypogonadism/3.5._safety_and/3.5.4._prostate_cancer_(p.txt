3.5.4. prostate cancer (pca). considerable number observational studies failed demonstrate association circulating higher testosterone levels pca . contrast, studies investigating relationship low levels testosterone risk pca found men low levels ft reduced risk developing low-to-intermediate-grade pca, non-significantly increased chance developing high-grade pca . peculiar pattern also reported trials health professionals follow-up study, prostate cancer prevention trial (pcpt) reduction dutasteride prostate cancer events (reduce), varying magnitudes significance . meta-analysis, including 27 placebo-controlled, rcts, found evidence increased psa levels following testosterone therapy one-year. considering eleven studies reporting occurrence pca, meta-analysis found evidence increased risk pca. however, one year follow-up may considered short draw firm conclusions risks developing pca. furthermore, analysis restricted studies > 1-year follow-up, significant changes psa levels increased risk pca found . five-year median follow-up three independent registry studies > 1,000 patients undergoing testosterone therapy, pca occurrence always remained reported incidence rate general population . similar results reported large observational study including 10,311 men treated testosterone therapy 28,029 controls median follow-up 5.3 years . study, also showed risk pca decreased men highest tertile testosterone therapy cumulative dose exposure compared controls . recently, traverse study, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, noninferiority trial involving 5246 men aged 45 80 years, pre-existing high risk cvd treated low testosterone levels (i.e., total < 10.4 nmol/l) associated reported symptoms hypogonadism, show difference terms pca incidence high-grade pca rate arms (testosterone therapy vs. placebo) mean follow-up, 33.0Â± (sd) 12.1 months. conversely, trial showed significantly greater increase baseline total psa treatment group compared placebo arm . regards pca survivors, safety terms risk recurrence progression yet established. limited data available literature, case series providing sufficient data draw definitive conclusions (e.g., insufficient follow-up, small samples, lack control arms, heterogeneity study population treatment regimen, etc.) . meta-analysis derived thirteen studies including 608 patients, 109 history high-risk pca, follow-up 1-189.3 months , suggested testosterone therapy increase risk biochemical recurrence, available evidence poor, limiting data interpretation . similar considerations derived another, larger meta-analysis 21 studies . however, important recognise meta-analyses demonstrated high heterogeneity among different studies included limited number subjects. rct assessing safety/benefit ratio testosterone therapy hypogonadal men successfully treated prostatectomy non-aggressive prostate pca currently ongoing . conclusion, recent literature support increased risk pca hypogonadal men undergoing testosterone therapy. although mandatory avoid testosterone administration men advanced pca, insufficient long-term prospective data safety testosterone therapy pca survivors , prompt caution choosing treat symptomatic hypogonadal men setting. particular, patients receive comprehensive counselling regarding uncertain long-term effects testosterone therapy context, necessitates investigation. due lack strong evidence-based data safety, possible use testosterone therapy symptomatic hypogonadal men previously treated pca fully discussed patients limited low-risk individuals.
