3.5.3. Disease management and follow-up. Prevention of rUTIs includes counselling regarding avoidance of risk factors, non-antimicrobial measures and antimicrobial prophylaxis [142,146]. These interventions should be attempted in this order. Any urological risk factor must be identified and treated. Significant residual urine should be treated optimally, including by CIC when judged to be appropriate. 3.5.3.1. Evidence Summary A broad literature with cut-off of 31st May 2021 identified 3,604 abstracts of which 361 were selected for full text review. In total 114 systematic reviews or guidelines based on systematic literature searches and 131 original publications were selected for further analysis. A further 18 relevant publications were identified from the references of the reviewed studies. Selected studies were assigned to one of nine subgroups based on the method of prevention. An updated search with cut-off date of 1st June 2022 identified a further 316 abstracts of which 25 were selected for further analysis. The evidence question addressed was: In women with recurrent symptomatic lower urinary tract infection what interventions reduce the rate of recurrence? 3.5.3.2. Behavioural modifications Women with rUTI should be counselled on avoidance of risks (e.g., insufficient drinking, habitual and post-coital delayed urination, wiping from front to back after defecation, douching and wearing occlusive underwear) before initiation of long-term prophylactic drug treatment, although there is limited evidence available regarding these approaches [147,148]. An open-label RCT found that additional fluid intake of 1.5 L a day in premenopausal women with rUTI who were low-volume drinkers (< 1.5 L a day) reduced the number of cystitis episodes and antibiotic usage over a 12-month period [149] 3.5.3.3. Non-antimicrobial prophylaxis 3.5.3.3.1. Hormonal replacement Based on the results of four meta-analyses topical oestrogen therapy (either as a creme or a pessary) shows a trend towards rUTI prevention [150-153]. All studies reported that application was superior compared to placebo but was inferior compared to antibiotics. Due to its pharmacokinetics vaginal admission has no systematic side effects, however local irritation and minor bleeding can occur. The use of oral oestrogens was not effective for rUTI prophylaxis compared to placebo, furthermore it was associated with an unfavourable systematic side effect profile. A single prospective, non-comparative study of 30 pre-menopausal women with rUTI on oral contraceptives reported a beneficial effect for additional topical oestrogen therapy [154]. 3.5.3.3.2. Immunoactive prophylaxis Several meta-analyses and systematic reviews based on nine RCTs showed that oral immunotherapy with OM-89 is an effective and safe method for the prevention of rUTIs compared to placebo at short-term follow up (< 6 months) [151,155,156]. A vaginal suppository containing ten strains of heat-killed uropathogenic bacteria significantly reduced the risk of rUTI compared to placebo in a meta-analysis of three small RCTs [155-157]. The preventive effect was more pronounced with booster treatment. A systematic review of two retrospective and three prospective cohort studies concluded that MV140 may decrease the number of rUTI episodes and/or increase the probability of patients being UTI free [158]. A placebo controlled RCT of MV140 reported a significant decrease in rUTI episodes in both MV140 groups vs. placebo [159]. At 12 months follow-up 25% of women treated with placebo (95% CI, 15% to 35%) were UTI free compared with 56% (95% CI, 44% to 67%) and 58% (95% CI, 44% to 67%) of women who received three and six months of MV140 treatment, respectively. The median number of UTI episodes per patient was 3.0 (0.5 to 6.0) for the placebo group compared with 0.0 (0.0 to 1.0) in both groups receiving MV140 [159]. A comparative single-centre study of 124 women vaccinated with StroVac compared to 49 women receiving antibiotic prophylaxis with 24-month follow-up concluded that StroVac is an effective non-antibiotic prophylaxis for rUTI [160]. However, this study was not randomised or blinded resulting in a high risk of bias (selection and imprecision). 3.5.3.3.3. Prophylaxis with probiotics (Lactobacillus spp.) Five meta-analyses with differing results and eleven relevant systematic reviews were identified [151,161-174]. Two meta-analyses reported significant positive effects for rUTI prevention with effective probiotics compared to placebo [165,167]. The contradictory results of the four meta-analyses are a result of the analysis of different Lactobacillus strains and different administration regimes, treatment durations, and patient populations. Most studies concluded that not all Lactobacillus strains are effective for vaginal flora restoration and rUTI prevention. The highest efficacy was shown with L. rhamnosus GR-1, L. reuteri B-54, L. reuteri RC-14, L. casei shirota, and L. crispatus CTV-05 [151,163,165,167]. Although meta-analyses including all known Lactobacilli strains did not show a significant treatment benefit [151,163,165,167], sensitivity analysis excluding studies using ineffective strains resulted in a positive treatment effect [165]. Of the eleven systematic reviews, seven concluded that prophylaxis with vaginal probiotics has a beneficial clinical impact for the prevention of rUTI [152,153,161,164,166,168-171,173]. The available data is too minimal or of low quality to allow the panel to make recommendations on the route of admission, optimal dosage, and treatment duration for probiotic prophylaxis. 3.5.3.3.4. Prophylaxis with cranberry Seven meta-analyses and several systematic reviews were identified [151,175-180]. A Cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis found that when compared with placebo, water or not treatment, cranberry products did not significantly reduce the occurrence of symptomatic UTI overall or in women with recurrent UTIs [175]. However, six subsequent meta-analyses concluded that consumption of cranberry-containing products may protect against UTIs in certain patient populations [151,176-180]. The differing outcomes across the meta-analyses can be contributed to the clinical and methodological heterogeneity of the included studies [181]. A RCT of 145 women randomised to high-dose vs. low-dose cranberry proanthocyanidin extract reported no significant reduction in the number of symptomatic UTI episodes between the groups [182]. Although the efficacy of cranberry products remains unclear, the panel consensus is that clinicians may recommend them for rUTI prevention in women who are informed of the weak evidence base due to their favourable benefit to harm ratio. However, there is no clear clinical evidence regarding the appropriate dose and treatment duration. 3.5.3.3.5. Prophylaxis with D-mannose A meta-analysis including one RCT, one randomised cross-over trial and one prospective cohort study analysed data on 390 patients and found that D-mannose was effective for rUTI prevention compared to placebo with comparable efficacy to antibiotic prophylaxis [183]. Another systematic review, concluded that D-mannose had a significant effect on UTI, but that further studies were needed to confirm these findings [161]. A further systematic review including 695 patients reported that D-Mannose improved quality of life and significantly reduced rUTIs in both catheter and non-catheter users and was effective in reducing the incidence of rUTIs and prolonging UTI-free periods [184]. However, a Cochrane systematic review including 719 patients was unable to determine if D-mannose when compared to no treatment, other supplements or antibiotics significantly reduced the number of rUTI episodes [185]. The overall quality of the evidence was low. 3.5.3.3.6. Endovesical instillation Endovesical instillations of hyaluronic acid (HA) and chondroitin sulphate (CS) have been used for glycosaminoglycan (GAG) layer replenishment in the treatment of interstitial cystitis, overactive bladder, radiation cystitis, and for prevention of rUTI [186]. A meta-analysis (n=143) based on two RCTs and two non-RCTs found significantly decreased UTI rates per patient/year and significantly longer mean UTI recurrence times for HA and HA-CS therapy compared to control treatment [187]. In addition, subgroup analysis of the two RCTs using HA-CS reported a significantly decreased UTI rate per patient-year, significantly longer mean UTI recurrence time and a significantly better pelvic pain and urgency/frequency (PUF) total score. However, 24-h urinary frequency measured as number of voids in 3 days were not significantly improved after therapy [187]. Another meta-analysis (n=800) including two RCTs and six non-RCTs found that when compared to control treatment HA, with or without CS, was associated with a significantly lower mean UTI rate per patient-year and a significantly longer time to UTI recurrence [188]. Furthermore, HA-CS therapy was associated with significantly greater mean reductions in PUF total and symptom scores and the percentage of patients with UTI recurrence during follow-up was also lower [188]. As randomised controlled studies are available only for HA plus CS, the quality of evidence is higher for the combination than for HA alone. 3.5.3.3.7. Methenamine hippurate A Cochrane Review from 2012 based on thirteen studies, with high levels of heterogeneity, concluded that methenamine hippurate may be effective for preventing UTI in patients without renal tract abnormalities, particularly when used for short-term prophylaxis [189]. A meta-analysis from 2021 based on six studies found that although studies showed a trend towards a benefit for methenamine hippurate in prevention of rUTIs there was no statistically significant difference between the efficacy of methenamine hippurate and any comparators [190]. A subsequent RCT including 240 women randomised (1 : 1) to receive once-daily low-dose antibiotic prophylaxis or twice-daily methenamine hippurate for twelve months reported that the incident rate of patient-reported symptomatic UTIs decreased to 1.38 episodes per person per year for the methenamine hippurate group vs. 0.89 episodes per person per year for the antibiotic group. The absolute difference was 0.49 confirming that methenamine hippurate was not inferior to antibiotic prophylaxis. The rate of adverse events was similar in both groups and a sustained benefit for both treatment arms was observed at six months follow-up [191,192]. 3.5.3.4. Antimicrobials for preventing rUTI 3.5.3.4.1. Continuous low-dose antimicrobial prophylaxis and post-coital prophylaxis Four meta-analyses and numerous systematic reviews and guidelines were identified [153,193-203]. All available meta-analyses conclude that antibiotic prophylaxis is the most effective approach against UTI recurrences compared with placebo or no treatment [193-195]. Antimicrobials may be given as continuous low-dose prophylaxis for longer periods, or as post-coital prophylaxis. There is no significant difference in the efficacy of the two approaches. There is no consensus about the optimal duration of continuous antimicrobial prophylaxis, with studies reporting treatment duration of three to twelve months. After discontinuation of the drug, UTIs tend to re-occur, especially among those, who have had three or more infections annually. It is mandatory to offer both continuous low-dose antimicrobial and post-coital prophylaxis after counselling, and when behavioural modifications as well as non-antimicrobial measures have been unsuccessful. Differences in outcomes between antibiotics did not reach statistical significance. The choice of agent should be based on the local resistance patterns. Regimens include nitrofurantoin 50 mg or 100 mg once daily, fosfomycin trometamol 3 g every ten days, trimethoprim 100 mg once daily and during pregnancy cephalexin 125 mg or 250 mg or cefaclor 250 mg once daily [142,204]. Post-coital prophylaxis should be considered in pregnant women with a history of frequent UTIs before onset of pregnancy, to reduce their risk of UTI [205]. 3.5.3.4.2. Self-diagnosis and self-treatment In patients with good compliance, self-diagnosis and self-treatment with a short course regimen of an antimicrobial agent should be considered [206]. The choice of antimicrobials is the same as for sporadic acute uncomplicated UTI (section 3.4.4.4).
