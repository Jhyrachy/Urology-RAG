3.13.4.4. Urinary tract infection. Urinary tract infections are common in children with neurogenic bladders. However, there is no consensus in most European centres, for prevention, diagnosing and treating UTIs in children with neurogenic bladders performing CIC [791]. Although bacteriuria is seen in more than half of children on CIC, patients who are asymptomatic do not need treatment [792]. Continuous antibiotic prophylaxis (CAP) creates more bacterial resistance as demonstrated by a randomized study. Those that stopped the prophylaxis had reduced bacterial resistance, however, 38 out of 88 started antibiotic prophylaxis again due to recurrent UTIs or the caregivers request [793]. A cohort study with 20 patients confirmed these findings. Continuous antibiotic prophylaxis was not protective against the development of symptomatic UTIs and new renal scarring but increased the risk of bacterial resistance [794]. A randomized study in 20 children showed that cranberry capsules significantly reduced the UTI-rate as well as the rate of bacteriuria [795]. If VUR is present, prophylactic antibiotics should be started when patients experience recurrent UTIs [796,797]. 3.13.4.4.1. Urinary tract infection and clean intermittent catheterisation The incidence of asymptomatic bacteriuria ranges between 42%-76% [723,733,798]. A cross-over study in 40 children with neurogenic bladder demonstrated, that the reuse of CIC-catheters for up to three weeks compared to one week increased the prevalence of bacteriuria from 34% to 74% (it was 60% at the start of the study). During the study-period of eighteen weeks, none of the patients developed a febrile UTI [799]. There is no medical benefit in performing CAP in children with neurogenic bladder, who perform CIC [733]. In those with recurrent UTI, intravesical instillation of gentamycin or neomycin/polymyxin may be an option [800,801]. Reflux Secondary reflux in patients with neurogenic bladder increases the risk for pyelonephritis. The treatment is primary related to bladder function including anticholinergic therapy, CIC and may be later augmentation [802]. Those with early and post-therapy persistent reflux during videourodynamic studies at low pressure have a higher risk of pyelonephritis [803]. Patients with a high-grade reflux before augmentation have a higher risk of persistent symptomatic reflux after the enterocystoplasty [804]. Therefore simultaneous ureteral re-implantation in high-grade symptomatic reflux especially in those with low-pressure high-grade reflux should be discussed with the patient/caregivers. Endoscopic treatment has a failure rate of up to 75% after a median follow-up of 4.5 years [805] which is in contrast to the open techniques with a higher success rate but may have an increased risk of inducing obstruction [806].
