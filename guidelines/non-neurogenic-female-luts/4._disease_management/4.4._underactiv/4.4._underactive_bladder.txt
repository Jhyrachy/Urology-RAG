4.4. Underactive bladder. Underactive bladder is a common clinical entity, defined by the ICS as “a symptom complex characterised by a slow urinary stream, hesitancy, and straining to void, with or without a feeling of incomplete bladder emptying sometimes with storage symptoms” [456]. Diagnosis of UAB is based on clinical symptoms and the presentation and aetiology can be variable. This differs from DU, which is a diagnosis based on urodynamic studies. Detrusor underactivity is defined by the ICS as “a detrusor contraction of reduced strength and/or duration, resulting in prolonged bladder emptying and/or failure to achieve complete bladder emptying within a normal time span” [1]. Acontractile detrusor is specified when there is no measurable detrusor contraction. Female voiding dysfunction is defined by the ICS as “a diagnosis based on symptoms and urodynamic investigations characterised by abnormally slow and/or incomplete micturition, based on abnormally slow urine flow rates and/or abnormally high PVR volume” [113]; ideally on repeated measurement to confirm abnormality. Pressure–flow studies may be required to determine the precise cause of the voiding dysfunction [31].
