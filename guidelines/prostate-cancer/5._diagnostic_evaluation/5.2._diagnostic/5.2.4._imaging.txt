5.2.4. Imaging. 5.2.4.1. Magnetic resonance imaging Multi-parametric MRI combines T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted, and dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging. Although MRI is mainly initiated after suspicion of PCa based on PSA and/or DRE, it has also been analysed as an initial test [179]. Besides suggesting the presence of PCa, imaging also allows targeted prostate biopsy and provides staging information. Prostate cancer appears as areas with low signal intensity on T2-weighted imaging, restriction of diffusion and early and intense enhancement on perfusion imaging. However, there is substantial overlap between the appearances of PCa and some prostate benign conditions. The Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) has been proposed to standardize interpretation and stratify men with suspected PCa on a 1- to 5- risk scale of having csPCa [180,181]. Correlation with RP specimens shows that MRI has good sensitivity for the detection and localisation of ISUP grade group ≥ 2 cancers, especially when their diameter is larger than 10 mm [182]. MRI is less sensitive in identifying ISUP grade group 1 PCa. It identifies less than 30% of ISUP grade 1 cancers smaller than 0.5 cc identified on RP specimens by histopathology analysis [182-185]. The good sensitivity of magnetic resonance imaging for ISUP grade group ≥ 2 cancer was further confirmed in patients who underwent template biopsies. In a Cochrane meta-analysis which compared MRI to template biopsies (≥ 20 cores) in biopsy-naïve and repeat-biopsy settings, MRI had a pooled sensitivity of 0.91 (95% CI: 0.83–0.95) and a pooled specificity of 0.37 (95% CI: 0.29–0.46) for ISUP grade group > 2 cancers. For ISUP grade ≥ 3 cancers, MRI pooled sensitivity and specificity were 0.95 (95% CI: 0.87–0.99) and 0.35 (95% CI: 0.26–0.46), respectively [186]. In a meta-analysis of seventeen studies involving men with suspected or biopsy-proven PCa, the average PPVs for ISUP grade group ≥ 2 cancers of lesions with a PI-RADS version 2.1 score of 3, 4 and 5 were 16% (7–27%), 59% (39–78%), and 85% (73–94%), respectively, but with significant heterogeneity among studies [187]. In biopsy naïve men, an MRI-based indication for biopsy after referral, leads to lower rates of biopsy, lower rates of men diagnosed with PCa labelled as insignificant, and more men with PCa labelled as csPCa [121,186,188-190]. This is also true in men with prior negative biopsy [186,191] (see section 5.4.2). 5.2.4.2. Transrectal ultrasound and ultrasound-based techniques Standard TRUS is not reliable at detecting PCa [192] and the diagnostic yield of additional biopsies performed on hypoechoic lesions is negligible [190]. New sonographic modalities such as micro-Doppler, sonoelastography or contrast-enhanced US provided promising preliminary findings, either alone, or combined into the so-called ‘multi-parametric US’ [193,194]. In the multi-parametric US vs. multi-parametric MRI to diagnose PCa (CADMUS) trial, 306 patients underwent both multi-parametric MRI and multi-parametric US composed of B-mode, Colour Doppler, real-time elastography, and contrast-enhanced US. Patients with at least one positive test underwent targeted biopsy. Multi-parametric US detected 4.3% fewer csPCa while submitting 11.1% more patients to biopsy than MRI [195]. High-resolution micro-US shows improved spatial resolution but struggles to assess the anterior part of large prostates. Two prospective trials assessed MRI and micro-US interpreted in a blinded manner before combined targeted and systematic biopsy. In one, MRI and micro-US detected respectively 60 (76%) and 58 (73%) of the 79 csPCas, while systematic sampling detected 45/79 cases (57%). MRI-targeted biopsy detected seven csPCas missed by micro-US; of these three were anterior lesions. Micro-US-guided biopsy detected five csPCas missed by MRI; of these, three were at the apex [196]. In the other study, MRI- and micro-US-targeted biopsy depicted csPCa in 37 (39%) and 33 (35%) of the 94 men, respectively while the MRI- plus micro-US-targeted pathway detected 38 csPCa [197]. These findings suggest that MRI and micro-US could complement each other. Micro-US could also be an interesting alternative to MRI/fusion since biopsy operators who are aware of MRI findings can localise most MRI lesions on micro-US and, thus, target them with direct US image guidance [198]. Of note, evaluation of micro-US inter-operator variability is currently lacking. 5.2.4.3. Prostate-specific antigen-Positron emission tomography/Computed tomography (or Magnetic resonance imaging) Though mainly used for staging purposes, PSMA-PET/CT (or -PET/MRI) prostate expression may be used to indicate and target biopsies. For csPCa detection, a pooled sensitivity of 0.89 and a pooled specificity of 0.56 have been reported [199]. In a prospective trial of 291 patients, combined PSMA + MRI improved negative predicted value (NPV) compared with MRI alone (91% vs. 72%, test ratio = 1.27 [1.11–1.39], p < 0.001). Sensitivity also improved (97% vs. 83%, p < 0.001), but specificity was reduced (40% vs. 53%, p = 0.011) [122].
