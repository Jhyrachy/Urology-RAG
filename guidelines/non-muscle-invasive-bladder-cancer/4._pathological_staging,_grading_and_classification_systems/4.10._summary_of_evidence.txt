4.10. Summary of evidence and guidelines for bladder cancer classification. Summary of evidenceLEThe depth of invasion (staging) is classified according to the TNM classification.2aTumours confined to the mucosa and invading the lamina propria are classified as stage Ta and T1, respectively. Flat, high-grade tumours that are confined to the mucosa are classified as CIS (Tis).2aHistological grading of urothelial NMIBC is classified according to the WHO 2004/2016/2022 (PUNLMP, LG/HG) systems and/or WHO 1973 (G1–G3).2aThe WHO 2004/2016/2022 classification provides slightly better reproducibility than the 1973 classification.2aBoth the WHO 1973 and the 2004/2016/2022 classification systems are prognostic for progression, but not for recurrence.2aThe WHO 1973 is a stronger prognosticator of progression in TaT1 NMIBC than the WHO 2004/2016. However, a 3-tier hybrid (LG/G1-G2, HG/G2 & HG/G3) or a 4-tier hybrid LG/G1, LG/G2, HG/G2 and HG/G3) combination of both classification systems proved to be superior to either classification system alone.2a RecommendationsStrength ratingUse the 2017 TNM system for classification of the depth of tumour invasion (staging).StrongProvide T1 sub-stage if the lamina propria is adequately sampled using either micrometric (T1e and T1m) or histo-anatomic (T1a and T1b) principles.WeakUse both the 1973 and 2004/2022 WHO grading classification systems, or a hybrid system.WeakDo not use the term ‘superficial’ bladder cancer.Strong
