4.1.4.1.4.3. Weight loss. Being overweight or obese has been identified as a risk factor for LUTS in epidemiological studies [135,136]. There is evidence that the prevalence of both UUI and SUI increases proportionately with body massindex (BMI) [137]. However, the evidence base largely relates to obesity and SUI rather than UUI and OAB. Therefore, no definite inference can be drawn between obesity and the prevalence of OAB.
