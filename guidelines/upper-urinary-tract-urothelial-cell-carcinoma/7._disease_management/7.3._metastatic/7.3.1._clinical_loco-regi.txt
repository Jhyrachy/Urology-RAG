7.3.1. Clinical loco-regional lymph node metastases. Evidence is lacking regarding the optimal management of clinical node-positive disease. Patients with clinically N+ UTUC should be offered downstaging first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. In patients whose cancer responds or who have stable disease, maintenance avelumab can be offered, especially in cN2 disease [290]. Depending on the extent of the nodal disease (i.e., cN1/N2) surgical resection with LN dissection can be discussed in a multidisciplinary team and with the patient when responding on after initial systemic therapy. In patients whose cancer progress, second-line treatment can be offered, similar to metastatic disease [291,292].
