3.5.4. Summary of evidence and recommendations for the diagnostic evaluation and treatment of rUTIs. Summary of evidenceLEExtensive routine workup including cystoscopy, imaging, etc. has a low diagnostic yield for the diagnosis of rUTI.3Increased water intake is an effective antimicrobial-sparing strategy to prevent rUTI in premenopausal women at high risk for recurrence who drink low volumes (< 1.5 L) of fluid daily.3Vaginal oestrogen replacement has shown a trend towards preventing rUTI in post-menopausal women.1bImmunoactive prophylaxis has been shown to be more effective than placebo for in female patients with rUTIs in several randomised trials with a good safety profile.1aProbiotics containing L. rhamnosus GR-1, L. reuteri B-54 and RC-14, L. casei shirota, or L. crispatus CTV-05 are effective for vaginal flora restoration and have shown a trend towards prevention of rUTIs.1bCurrent scientific evidence regarding the efficacy of cranberry products in the prevention of UTIs is inconclusive.1aThere is contradictory evidence on the efficacy of D-mannose to reduce the number of UTI episodes.2Based on limited evidence intravesical GAG therapy can reduce the number of UTIs per patient per year, and prolong the time interval between rUTI episodes.2A RCT demonstrated the non-inferiority of twice-daily methenamine hippurate to daily antibiotic prophylaxis.1bBoth continuous low-dose antimicrobial prophylaxis and post-coital antimicrobial prophylaxis, have been shown to reduce the rate of rUTI.1bA prospective cohort study showed that intermittent self-start therapy is effective, safe and economical in women with rUTIs.2b RecommendationsStrength ratingDiagnose recurrent UTI by urine culture.StrongDo not perform an extensive routine workup (e.g., cystoscopy, full abdominal ultrasound) in women younger than 40 years of age with recurrent UTI and no risk factors.WeakAdvise pre-menopausal women regarding increased fluid intake as it might reduce the risk of recurrent UTI.WeakUse vaginal oestrogen replacement in post-menopausal women to prevent recurrent UTI.StrongUse immunoactive prophylaxis to reduce recurrent UTI in all age groups.StrongAdvise patients on the use of local or oral probiotic containing strains of proven efficacy for vaginal flora regeneration to prevent UTIs.WeakAdvise patients on the use of cranberry products to reduce recurrent UTI episodes; however, patients should be informed that the quality of evidence underpinning this is low with contradictory findings.WeakUse D-mannose to reduce recurrent UTI episodes, but patients should be informed of the overall weak and contradictory evidence of its effectiveness.WeakUse methenamine hippurate to reduce recurrent UTI episodes in women without abnormalities of the urinary tract.StrongUse endovesical instillations of hyaluronic acid or a combination of hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulphate to prevent recurrent UTIs in patients where less invasive preventive approaches have been unsuccessful. Patients should be informed that further studies are needed to confirm the results of initial trials.WeakUse continuous or post-coital antimicrobial prophylaxis to prevent recurrent UTI when non-antimicrobial interventions have failed. Counsel patients regarding possible side effects.StrongFor patients with good compliance self-administered short-term antimicrobial therapy should be considered.Strong
