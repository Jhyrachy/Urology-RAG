7.1. Signs and symptoms of female urethral strictures. The symptoms of female urethral strictures are non-specific and therefore generally non-diagnostic. Female urethral stricture presents with mixed filling and voiding symptoms with frequency in 63%, urgency in 55%, incomplete emptying in 36%, poor flow in 32%, urinary incontinence in 31% (stress, urge or mixed), strain void in 21.5%, UTI in 20.5%, nocturia in 20.5% and dysuria in 20%. It very rarely presents with urethral pain (2.7%), terminal dribble (2%), haematuria (1.6%) or renal failure (0.5%) (see supplementary Table S7.1). There is often a significant delay in diagnosis of FUS from time of development of symptoms with mean delays of 4.3-12 years described (range 1-30 years) [137].
