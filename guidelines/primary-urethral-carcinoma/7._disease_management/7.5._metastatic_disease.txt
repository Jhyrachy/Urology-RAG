7.5. Metastatic disease. A recent analysis of the SEER database reported that patients with M1 disease who underwent primary site surgery did not exhibit any survival benefit [59]. Systemic therapy in metastatic disease should be selected based on the histology of the tumour. The EAU Guidelines on Muscle-invasive and Metastatic Bladder Cancer can be followed if UC is the predominant histology [2]. Even though urethral carcinoma patients have been included in large clinical trials on immunotherapy, so far, in terms of response rates, no subgroup analyses are available [94]. In addition, there is an urgent clinical need to better address the role of local palliative treatment strategies in primary urethral carcinoma including surgery, which has shown to impact positively on QoL aspects in selected patients with advanced genital cancers [95]. Figure 7.1: Management of primary urethral carcinoma*Ensure complete circumferential assessment if penile-preserving/urethra-sparing surgery or partial urethrectomy is intended.**Squamous cell carcinoma.***Regional lymphadenectomy should be considered in clinically enlarged lymph nodes.****Consider neoadjuvant chemotherapy.*****In extensive or BCG-unresponsive disease: consider (primary) cystoprostatectomy +/- urethrectomy + lymphadenectomy. BCG = bacillus Calmette-Gu√©rin; CT = computed tomography; MRI = magnetic resonance imaging; PUC = primary urethral carcinoma; TUR = transurethral resection.
