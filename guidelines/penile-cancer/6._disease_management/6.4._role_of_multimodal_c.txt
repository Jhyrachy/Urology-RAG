6.4. Role of multimodal chemotherapy/radiotherapy in the management of (regional) lymph nodes. 6.4.1. Systemic therapy 6.4.1.1. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy Bulky inguinal LN enlargement indicates extensive lymphatic metastatic disease for which few patients will benefit from surgery alone. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy before inguinal LN surgery allows for early treatment of systemic disease and down-sizing of the inguinal LN metastases. In responders, complete surgical treatment is possible with reasonable clinical outcome. Cisplatin/5-FU (PF) chemotherapy achieved a response rates of 25–50% with acceptable toxicity [261,262]. Over a period of 30 years, five different NAC regimens including PF were used in twenty patients, with long-term survival in 37% of responders who underwent radical LN surgery after NAC [263]. In the EORTC cancer study 30992, 26 patients with locally-advanced or metastatic disease received irinotecan and cisplatin chemotherapy. Although the study did not meet its primary endpoint (response rate), there were three cases of pathologically complete remissions (pCRs) [186]. Hypothetical similarities between penile SCC and head and neck SCC led to the evaluation in penile cancer of chemotherapy regimens with an efficacy in head and neck SCC, including taxanes. A phase II trial evaluated treatment with 4 cycles of neoadjuvant paclitaxel, cisplatin, and ifosfamide (TIP) in patients with clinical N2 or N3 LN metastases [180]. An objective response rate (ORR) of 50% was reported in 30 patients, including three pCRs. The estimated median time to progression (TTP) was 8.1 months and the median OS was 17.1 months. Long-term DFS was observed in 67% of responding patients and 7% of non-responding patients. The combination of PF plus a taxane has been used in neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings [183,184,264,265]. A phase II trial with docetaxel, cisplatin, and 5-FU (TPF) reported an objective response of 38.5% in 29 locally-advanced or metastatic patients, although the study did not meet its primary endpoint, and there was significant toxicity [184]. A prospective study testing neoadjuvant TPF in 26 patients with loco-regionally advanced penile cancer showed a pathologic complete response in one patient, with a 2-year PFS and DSS probability of 12% and 28%, respectively [177]. Treatment was discontinued in 23% of patients because of toxicity. In a recent meta-analysis analysing 10 studies (n = 182 patients, mostly retrospective), the pooled ORR was 53% (95% CI: 42–64), and the overall mortality was 55% (95% CI: 40–70) [187]. The available evidence favours a cisplatin- and taxane-based combination (doublet or triplet) as the preferred approach. Overall, these results support the activity of pre-operative chemotherapy in patients with clinically-involved regional LNs from penile SCC. However, randomised studies are lacking and substantial concerns remain regarding the selection of patients who are best suited for a systemic therapy approach upfront. A large retrospective study including 743 patients who received a LND from several international institutions suggested patients with a clinical N3 stage constituted the cohort with the most appreciable benefit from NAC use, compared to LND alone [266]. Bilateral inguinal LN involvement emerged as a strong negative predictor of clinical outcome in patients with penile SCC, together with pelvic nodal involvement. In summary, given the poor outcome of upfront surgery, NAC is a potentially-suitable approach for patients having pelvic LN (cN3) metastases or fixed inguinal LN involvement (cN3), or bulky or bilateral involvement (cN2). In nonresponding patients, the potential benefits of surgery should be re-evaluated as prognosis is poor in these patients. See also section on chemo-radiotherapy. 6.4.1.2. Adjuvant chemotherapy There are known poor prognostic characteristics for a subset of patients with resected high-risk disease (such as involved pelvic LNs), indicating the likely presence of micrometastatic disease. Data exists on response rates for those with metastatic disease and there is possible benefit for pre-operative chemotherapy for those with unresectable locally advanced disease as described above. With extrapolation from other diseases, it stands to reason that systemic therapy following resection (i.e., adjuvant therapy) may improve outcomes. A retrospective multicentre analysis of patients with resected pathologically involved pelvic LNs suggested a potential benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy [264]. In this series, 84 patients were analyzed. Patients who received chemotherapy for relapsed disease were excluded. Compared to those not receiving adjuvant chemotherapy, patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy were younger, had lower T stage, more likely to have unilateral (rather than bilateral) LN involvement, and were less likely to receive adjuvant radiation. On multivariable analysis, receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with improved OS (HR: 0.40, 95% CI: 0.19–0.87, p = 0.021). Additional series have also been reported, including a series of 611 patients from the National Cancer Database reported in abstract form [267]. After adjusting for co-variates, there was no difference in survival for those receiving adjuvant chemotherapy. A recent meta-analysis examined this issue. After a systematic search, 7 studies were identified examining the use of peri-operative chemotherapy, 4 of which examined adjuvant chemotherapy (n = 771) [268]. There was no difference in survival for those receiving adjuvant chemotherapy vs. observation (HR: 0.95, 95%CI: 0.48–1.80). Upon examination of the overall data, there is no strong data supporting the use of adjuvant chemotherapy to improve OS following surgical resection of the primary tumour and involved LNs. However, given the fact that RFS is a relevant endpoint that has been suboptimally studied and there is a subset of patients at very high risk of recurrence, the Panel recommends a balanced discussion of risks and benefits of adjuvant chemotherapy in those thought to be healthy candidates. As previously stated for the neoadjuvant setting, the benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy is expected to be highest in the population of patients with pathological N3 stage, in particular for those patients with pelvic nodal involvement [266].

However, it could be offered to patients with pN3 disease post-LND if NAC has not been received, upon careful consideration of risks and benefits with the patient.4 RecommendationsStrength ratingOffer neoadjuvant chemotherapy using a cisplatin- and taxane-based combination to chemotherapy-fit patients with pelvic lymph node involvement or those with extensive inguinal involvement (cN3), in preference to up front surgery.WeakOffer chemotherapy as an alternative approach to upfront surgery to selected patients with bulky mobile inguinal nodes or bilateral disease (cN2) who are candidates for cisplatin and taxane-based chemotherapy.WeakHave a balanced discussion of risks and benefits of adjuvant chemotherapy with high-risk patients with surgically resected disease, in particular with those with pathological pelvic LN involvement (pN3). See also section on post-operative radiotherapy.Weak 6.4.2. Radiotherapy 6.4.2.1. Pre-operative radiation therapy The role of pre-operative chemo-radiotherapy is being investigated in the ongoing InPACT trial [260]. Since surgical therapy of enlarged LNs is of paramount importance, it is unlikely that pre-operative radiotherapy alone would provide sufficient benefit. Should a patient who is otherwise unfit for chemotherapy require treatment to LNs while awaiting surgery, radiotherapy alone may be considered using conventional daily fractionation to 45–50Gy. Radiotherapy to the groins in penile cancer conceptually requires inclusion of the pre-pubic fat a in order to cover in transit lymphatics [269]. 6.4.2.2. Post-operative radiation therapy Adjuvant radiation therapy for node-positive penile cancer remains controversial. Since there is no level 1 evidence to support the benefit of radiation therapy in terms of disease recurrence and survival, it is not recommended in prior guidelines [270,271]. Radiotherapy is being used in some institutions in the management of regional LNs for penile SCC, based on evidence and experience with other SCC sites (such as head/neck and vulvar carcinomas) [174,272,273]. Jaipuria et al., reported that following inguinal- and pelvic LND, patients with > 2 positive LNs but negative pelvic nodes (n = 32) had increased OS with adjuvant radiation therapy compared to adjuvant chemotherapy (48 months vs. 14 months p < 0.0001) [274]. Although 68% of patients had ENE, there were no in-field failures. The radiation dose was higher than that commonly used under these circumstances, 54 Gy for ENE and up to 57–60 Gy for gross residual disease. With a lower radiation dose of 50 Gy, Johnstone et al., reported a high rate of in-field failures (32/39) [275]. At this dose, adjuvant radiation therapy (either groin: p = 0.016 or inguinal-pelvic: p = 0.006) improved RFS only for patients without ENE. Ager et al., reporting on the experience with pN3 disease (either ENE or pelvic LN+) in two tertiary referral centres in the UK also found dose to be critically important [276]. A 121 of 146 patients received adjuvant radiotherapy. The 5-year RFS was 51%. Twenty-six of 55 recurrences were in-field, but the risk of in-field failure was twice as high for lower doses < 50 Gy. For 92 patients with positive pelvic LN from 4 international centres, adjuvant radiation was found to prolong DSS by 6 months and delay the time to recurrence [277]. The data collated in Table 6.3 reveal variable results with conventional radiotherapy delivered in the adjuvant setting, potentially impacted by HPV status and presence/absence of ENE. Also notable in the data is the fact that traditional radiotherapy doses delivered to microscopic disease may be insufficient. Recent genomic data analyses have modelled that a higher radiation dose may be necessary for management of penile cancer primary lesions and nodal basins [278,279].

HPV status could be a suitable selection factor for patients who will benefit from adjuvant radiotherapy after ILND (in analogy to other HPV-related cancers). Bandini et al., reported on 507 patients from 11 centres, 86 of whom were HPV+. Among patients receiving adjuvant radiotherapy, those harbouring HPV-positive tumours appeared to have an increased OS relative to HPV-negative patients. However, more (prospective) studies are needed to validate these findings [34]. As in other SCC sites such as head and neck cancer, HPV status may also predict for increased responsiveness to combined chemo-radiotherapy. Yuan et al., reported improved loco-regional control (LRC) of 83% over 38% (p = 0.038) for node-positive p16+ patients receiving chemo-radiotherapy following LND [273]. Twenty-eight of 51 patients were LN+, of whom 14 received chemo-radiotherapy, 7 of whom were HPV-positive. Overall, regardless of HPV status, 2-year LRC was 54% for those receiving adjuvant chemo-radiotherapy vs. 13% (p = 0.006). Choo et al., found similar efficacy of adjuvant chemo-radiotherapy with improved CSS at one and 2 years, even though the patients selected for adjuvant chemo-radiotherapy had a higher number of positive LNs (64% > 5 vs. 8%), more pN3 disease (72% vs. 17%) and more ENE (45% vs. 17%) [281]. The OS was the same for the unfavourable group receiving adjuvant chemo-radiotherapy as it was for the more favourable earlier-stage patients not receiving chemo-radiotherapy. Although PLND is recommended for patients with high-risk groin pathology (N2–N3), this is not the practice in all jurisdictions. Maibom et al., reported from Denmark on the use of inguinal-pelvic chemo-radiotherapy for 21 patients with a median follow-up of 74 months [282]. All patients had ENE and two-thirds had bilateral groin disease, with a median OS of 84 months and 57% 5-year survival. This concept is being tested in the currently accruing InPACT trial where men with high-risk groin pathology can be randomised to chemo-radiotherapy or PLND followed by chemo-radiotherapy [260]. 6.4.2.3. Summary of evidence and guidelines for pre- and post-operative radiotherapy Summary of evidenceLEAdjuvant radiotherapy results in increased OS if greater than two inguinal LN-positive and PLND-dissection negative.2bAdjuvant conventional radiotherapy doses are often insufficient for durable control. Increased DSS and RFS in penile cancer requires 54 Gy for ENE and 57–60 Gy for positive margins.3Peri-operative chemo-radiotherapychemo-radiotherapy significantly improves loco-regional control over radiotherapy alone for other SCC originating in anal canal or head and neck, whilst in vulvar cancers it improves OS. The evidence is, however, sparse in penile cancer.1b RecommendationsStrength ratingOffer adjuvant radiotherapy (with or without chemo sensitisation) to patients with pN2/N3 disease, including those who received prior neoadjuvant chemotherapy.WeakOffer definitive radiotherapy (with or without chemo sensitisation) to patients unwilling or unable to undergo surgery.WeakOffer radiotherapy (with or without chemo sensitisation) to cN3 patients who are not candidates for multi-agent chemotherapy.Weak
