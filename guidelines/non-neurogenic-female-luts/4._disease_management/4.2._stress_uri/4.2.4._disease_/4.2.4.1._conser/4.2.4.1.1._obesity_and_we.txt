4.2.4.1.1. Obesity and weight loss. Being overweight or obese has been identified as one of the risk factors for LUTS and SUI in many epidemiological studies [136,137]. There is evidence that the prevalence of both UUI and SUI increases proportionately with BMI [301]. The proportion of patients who undergo surgery for incontinence who are overweight or obese is higher than that of the general population [137]. On the other hand, young, elite athletes, and women who work-out for fitness show a high prevalence of UI/SUI [281,302]. Three SRs concluded that weight loss was beneficial in improving UI [135,136,303]. Five further RCTs reported a similar beneficial effect on incontinence following surgical weight reduction programmes [304-308]. In a prospective study in 160 consecutive women who underwent bariatric surgery, surgically induced weight loss was associated with a significant improvement in pelvic floor disorders, including UI [309]. Similar results reported by prospective single-centre studies investigating the effect of weight loss induced by bariatric surgery revealed that bariatric surgery was associated with substantially reduced UI at eleven months and three years [310,311].
