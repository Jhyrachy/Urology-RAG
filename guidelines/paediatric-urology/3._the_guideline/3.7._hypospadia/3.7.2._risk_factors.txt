3.7.2. Risk factors. Risk factors associated with hypospadias are likely to be genetic, placental and/or environmental [305,306] (LE: 2b). Interactions between genetic and environmental factors may help explain non-replication in genetic studies of hypospadias. Single nucleotide polymorphisms seemed to influence hypospadias risk only in exposed cases [306,309] (LE: 2b). An additional family member with hypospadias is found in 7% of families, but this is more predominant in anterior and middle forms [309-312].Endocrine disorders can be detected in rare cases.Babies with a low birth weight have a higher risk of hypospadias [309-312].Over the last 25 years, a significant increase in the incidence of hypospadias has been found.Endocrines disruptors are one component of a multi-factorial model for hypospadias.The use of oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy has not been associated with an increased risk of hypospadias in offspring, but their use after conception increased the risk of middle and posterior hypospadias [310-313] (LE: 2a).
