3.2. Epidemiology. Penile cancer incidence varies across the world (Fig. 3.1). In industrialised countries, penile cancer is uncommon, with an overall incidence of around 0.94/100,000 males in Europe and 0.5 in the USA [11,12]. In contrast, in South America, Southeast Asia and parts of Africa, the incidence is much higher and can account for 1–2% of malignant disease in men [12]. The annual age-adjusted incidence is 0.7–3.0 in India, 8.3 in Brazil (per 100,000, respectively) and is higher in parts of Africa such as Uganda [12,13]. In Europe, there is considerable variation across countries. Data from Norway showed an increase in the age-standardised incidence rates in 5-year periods from 2001-2015 compared to the previous periods (0.65/100,000 in 1956–60 vs. 0.91/100,000, in 2011-2015) with an Estimated Annual Percent Change of +0.80% [14]. In the United Kingdom, the age-standardised incidence rate increased 28% between 1993 and 2018. This trend was seen in age groups from 50–79 years old. Incidence rates remained unchanged for both age extremes (< 50 and > 79 years) [15]. Based on 16 cancer registries in France, incidence rates between 2009 and 2011 were 0.59 per 100,000 men (95% CI: 0.50–0.68) and these rates have remained stable since 1989 [16]. In the USA, the incidence of penile cancer is affected by race and ethnicity, with the highest incidence in white Hispanics (1.01), followed by Alaskans and Native American Indians (0.77), African Americans (0.62) and white non-Hispanics (0.51), per 100,000 males, respectively. The overall age-adjusted incidence rate decreased between 1973 and 2002; per decade from 0.84 (1973–1982), to 0.69 (1983–1992), and 0.58 (1993–2002) per 100,000 males, respectively [17]. An increasing trend, slightly surpassing the previous incidence rates, was described using the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Result (SEER) 2000–2016 data [18], showing an estimated annual percent change of +3.5% from 2004-2016 [19]. The incidence increases with age [15,20], with a peak in the sixth decade but it does occur in younger men [21]. Penile cancer is common in regions with a high prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV), and approximately one-third to half of cancer cases are attributed to HPV-associated carcinogenesis [22,23]. There are no reports linking this cancer to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). In summary, it seems that a slight increase in incidence is seen in Western/developed countries, most likely caused by higher infection rates of HPV which is a trend also observed in oropharynx carcinoma [24].
