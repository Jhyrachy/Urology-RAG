5.6. Summary of evidence and recommendations for the diagnosis of UTUC. Summary of evidenceLEThe diagnosis and staging of UTUC is best done with computed tomography urography and URS.2aSelective urinary cytology has high sensitivity in high-grade tumours, including carcinoma in situ.3Urethrocystoscopy can detect concomitant BC.2a RecommendationsStrength ratingPerform a urethrocystoscopy to rule out bladder tumour.StrongPerform chest, abdominal and pelvis with computed tomography (CT) urography for diagnosis and staging.StrongUse diagnostic ureteroscopy (URS) if imaging and voided urine cytology are not sufficient for the diagnosis and/or risk-stratification of patients suspected to have UTUC.StrongMagnetic resonance urography or 18F-Fluorodeoxglucose positron emission tomography/CT may be used when CT is contra-indicated.Weak
