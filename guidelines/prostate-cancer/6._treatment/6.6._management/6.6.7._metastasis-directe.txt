6.6.7. Metastasis-directed therapy in M1-patients. In patients relapsing after a local treatment, a metastases-targeting therapy has been proposed, with the aim to delay systemic treatment. In a retrospective analysis on 211 patients treated with MDT, Milenkovic et al. aimed at defining prognostic factors for MFS, palliative ADT-free (pADT) survival and cause-specific survival (CSS). With a median follow-up of 42 months after MDT, patients with cN1 only had significantly superior 5-years MFS, pADT and CSS when compared to patients with M1 disease (p<0.02). Of interest, 23% of patients were free of biochemical recurrence at five years [1147]. There are two randomised phase II trials testing metastasis-directed therapy (MDT) using surgery ± SABR vs. surveillance [1148] or SABR vs. surveillance in men with oligo-recurrent PCa [1149]. Oligo-recurrence was defined as < 3 lesions on choline-PET/CT only [1148] or conventional imaging with MRI/CT and/or bone scan [1149]. The sample size was small with 62 and 54 patients, respectively, and a substantial proportion of them had nodal disease only [1148]. Androgen deprivation therapy-free survival was the primary endpoint in one study which was longer with MDT than with surveillance [1148]. The primary endpoint in the ORIOLE trial was progression after six months which was significantly lower with SBRT than with surveillance (19% vs. 61%, p = 0.005) [1149]. Recently the combined results of STOMP and ORIOLE confirmed the significant improvement in PFS in favour of MDT (HR: 0.44, p < 0.001) [1150]. A phase II trial assessed the biochemical response after 18F-DCFPyL PET/MRI and subsequent MDT. Overall biochemical response rate, defined as ≥ 50% PSA decline, was 60%, including 22% of patients with complete biochemical response [1151]. Currently there are no data to suggest an improvement in OS. Two comprehensive reviews highlighted MDT (SABR) as a promising therapeutic approach that must still be considered as investigational until the results of the ongoing RCT are available [1152,1153]. Thus far, the toxicity of MDT appears to be low, but this also needs to be confirmed [1154,1155].
