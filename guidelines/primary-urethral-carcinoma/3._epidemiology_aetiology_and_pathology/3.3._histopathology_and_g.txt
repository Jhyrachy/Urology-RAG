3.3. Histopathology and genomic profiling. Both the Surveillance of Rare Cancers in Europe (RARECARE) project and SEER database have reported that urothelial carcinoma (UC) of the urethra is the predominant histological type of primary urethral cancer (54–65%), followed by squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) (16–22%) and AC (10–16%) [8,27]. A SEER analysis of 2,065 men with primary urethral carcinoma (mean age 73 years) found that UC was most common (78%), and SCC (12%) and AC (5%) were significantly less frequent [28]. In women, AC is the more frequent histology (38–46.7%) followed by SCC (25.4–28%), UC (24.9–28%) and other histological entities (6%) [29,30]. Primary UC with unconventional histological subtypes are very rare and exhibit a dismal prognosis [31]. An analysis of the SEER database from 2004 to 2016 identified 165 cases of Primary UC with unconventional histological subtypes, 70.3% of which were in women, and reported that Mullerian-type tumor is the most frequent unconventional histology of urethral cancer, followed by melanocytic-type histology [31]. .
