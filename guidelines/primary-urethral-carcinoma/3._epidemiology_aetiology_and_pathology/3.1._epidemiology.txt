3.1. Epidemiology. Primary urethral carcinoma is considered a rare cancer, accounting for < 1% of all genitourinary malignancies [6] (ICD-O3 topography code: C68.0) [7]. In 2013, the prevalence of urethral carcinoma in the 28 European Union countries was 3,986 cases with an estimated annual incidence of 1,504 new cases, with a male/female prevalence of 2.9: 1 [8]. Likewise, in an updated analysis of the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database (2004â€“2016), the incidence of primary urethral carcinoma peaked in the > 75 years age group (7.6/million). The age-standardised rate was 4.3/million in men and 1.5/million in women and was almost negligible in those aged < 55 years (0.2/million) [9]. After matching for tumour and patient characteristics, women present with higher disease stage and exhibited higher cancer-specific mortality (CSM) [10].
