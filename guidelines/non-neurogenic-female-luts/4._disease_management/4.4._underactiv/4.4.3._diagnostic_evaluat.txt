4.4.3. Diagnostic evaluation. 4.4.3.1. Symptoms associated with detrusor underactivity A retrospective study correlated LUTS with urodynamic findings in 1,788 patients (1,281 women). Women with DU, defined as detrusor pressure at maximum flow rate (PdetQmax) < 20 cm H2O, maximum flow rate (Qmax) < 15 mL/s, BVE < 90% and no sign of obstruction on video-urodynamic studies, had a significantly higher occurrence of reduced and/or interrupted stream, hesitancy, feeling of incomplete bladder emptying, palpable bladder, and absent and/or decreased sensation compared with women with normal pressure and flow [463]. A qualitative study on a small sample of male and female patients diagnosed with DU reported a variety of LUTS and associated impact on QoL. Storage symptoms of nocturia, increased daytime frequency, and urgency, and the voiding symptoms of slow stream, hesitancy, and straining were reported by over half of the patients. A sensation of incomplete emptying and post-micturition dribble were also frequently described. The impact of their symptoms on QoL was variable, but in general, storage symptoms were more bothersome [464]. Based on current data, it is not possible to find a pivotal symptom or collection of symptoms to identify DU patients. The ICI Questionnaire-Underactive Bladder (ICIQ-UAB) has been developed as a research PROM tool [465]. 4.4.3.2. Urodynamic studies Non-invasive studies like uroflowmetry, PVR volume measurement and BVE determination are potentially useful to identify women who might have DU. There is considerable symptomatic overlap with BOO, and uroflowmetry and PVR volume findings may also be similar. Only invasive urodynamics with pressure–flow studies can reliably distinguish DU from BOO and these urodynamic diagnoses can coexist. Diagnosis in women is particularly difficult as they can void by relaxing the pelvic floor, that is, without detectable detrusor contraction during pressure–flow study and without increased abdominal pressure [466]. The simplest methods to define and diagnose DU are based on the use of cut-off values of Qmax and PdetQmax, possibly combined with cut-off values of PVR volume and BVE. However, there is no consensus on which cut-off values should be used [467]. It is obvious that the prevalence of DU depends on the criteria used. In a retrospective study of 1,015 women, DU was found in 14.9% when using Qmax < 12 mL/s or PVR volume > 150 mL; in 9.6% when using PdetQmax < 30 cm H2O and Qmax < 10 mL/s; and in 6.4% when using PdetQmax < 20 cm H2O, Qmax < 15 mL/s and BVE < 90% [468]. More elaborate methods combine urodynamic data into an index or a physical quantity that reflects bladder contraction strength. A value below a certain threshold would thus diagnose DU. Again, there is no consensus regarding what is normal/abnormal. Table 4 provides an overview of the best-known parameters, their background, and typical values. Watt’s factor (WF) estimates the power generated by the detrusor per unit area of bladder surface [469] and it varies during voiding. Usually, WFmax is considered. Alternatively, its value at Qmax can be used. Projected isovolumetric pressure (PIP) is a gross simplification of the bladder output relation and estimates the maximum detrusor pressure that can be generated by the bladder when the outlet is closed; the isovolumetric detrusor pressure. The bladder contractility index (BCI) is a reduction of PIP to an index [470]. The population in which PIP and BCI were developed mainly consisted of men. Projected isovolumetric pressure 1, is similar to PIP and also estimates the isovolumetric detrusor pressure, but was developed in an entirely female population via an experimental method [471]. A third method of quantifying bladder contraction strength involves stop tests. One study compared three types of direct measurement of isovolumetric pressure: (1) the voluntary stop test, in which the patient voluntarily interrupted flow; (2) the mechanical stop test, in which flow was interrupted by a balloon catheter; and (3) the continuous occlusion test, in which the subject tried to void against a blocked outlet. The latter had the best reliability and best detected drug-induced changes, though the results of the mechanical stop tests were similar [472]. All parameters discussed above give some information about the strength of detrusor contraction in a given void. They do not necessarily reflect what the detrusor might potentially achieve under optimum conditions [473]. Also, they give no information on voiding duration. No parameters for this are available. Finally, abnormally low bladder contraction strength does not necessarily imply insufficient bladder contraction strength to achieve optimal voiding. Table 4 summarises different parameters to measure detrusor contraction in female patients.
