7.4.4.3. Renal medullary carcinoma. SMARCB1-deficient renal medullary carcinoma is one of the most aggressive RCCs [68,199] and most patients (~67%) will present with metastatic disease [29,68]. Even patients who present with seemingly localised disease may develop macro metastases shortly thereafter, often within a few weeks. Despite treatment, median OS is thirteen months in the most recent series [33]. Due to the infiltrative nature and medullary epicentre of RMC, RN is favoured over PN even in very early-stage disease. Retrospective data indicate that nephrectomy in localised disease results in superior OS (16.4 vs. 7 months) compared with systemic chemotherapy alone, but longer survival was noted in patients who achieved an objective response to first-line chemotherapy [33,608]. There is currently no established role for distant metastasectomy or nephrectomy in the presence of metastases. Palliative radiation therapy is an option and may achieve regression in the targeted areas, but it will not prevent progression outside the radiation field [609,610]. Renal medullary carcinoma is refractory to monotherapies with targeted anti-angiogenic regimens including TKIs and mTOR inhibitors [33,173]. The mainstay systemic treatments for RMC are cytotoxic combination regimens which produce partial or complete responses in ~29% of patients [173]. There are no prospective comparisons between different chemotherapy regimens, but most published series used various combinations of platinum agents, taxanes, gemcitabine, and/or anthracyclines [33,34]. High-dose-intensity combination of MVAC has also shown efficacy against RMC [611] although a retrospective comparison did not show superiority of MVAC over cisplatin, paclitaxel, and gemcitabine [34]. Single-agent anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint therapy has produced responses in a few case reports, although, as yet insufficient data are available to determine the response rate to this approach [609,610]. Whenever possible, patients should be enrolled in clinical trials of novel therapeutic approaches, particularly after failing first-line cytotoxic chemotherapy. 7.4.4.3.1. Other rare tumours Knowledge about the systemic treatment of rare tumors is very limited, mostly based on a set of case reports. For some facts about therapy of renal tumours see chapter 3.5 and table 3.2. Metastatic collecting duct carcinoma (CDC) has a lowest mortality in concomitant use of cytoreductive nephrectomy and systemic therapy [612]. Systemic therapy was investigated in BONSAI phase II trial. Nivolumab showed cilical benefit in 60 % as a second-line therapy after cabozantinib failure [613]. TFE3-rearranged RCC showed objective response rate 25 % with ICI and 0 % with TKI and more prolonged OS (62.4 months with ICI vs 10.3 with TKI). Cabozantinib may be an exeption with 16.6% objective response. There is discussed future role of ICI-TKI combination (such as nivolumab plus cabozantinib) and cabozantinib plus belzutifan [614]. TFEB-altered RCC:TFEB-rearranged RCC: There is a general lack of information regarding the response to moderm systemic therapy. Combination of ICI and mTOR inhibitors are discussed. TFEB-amplified RCC (it occurs in elderly patients and displays more aggressive behaviour compared to TFEB-rearranged RCC) can be treated with VEGFR targeting agents or with VEGFR-TKI combination [614]. Some studies combine therapy TFE3- and TFEB-altered RCCs (because of former grouping ob both tumours to MiT family translocation RCCs). One retrospective study exhibit efficacy of ICI or ICI-TKI combination [615]. Other study provided evidence of the activity of cabozantinib in MiT TRCC, with more durable responses than those observed historically with other VEGFR-TKIs or ICIs [616]. In fumarate hydratase-deficient RCC with high metastatic potential, ICI monotherapies offer a better disease control rate than TKI monotherapies. In phase II trial, ORR of 51 % of combination of erlotinib and bevacizumab [614]. Other trial expressed a favorable response to ICI/TKI combinational therapy comparred to bevacizumab plus erlotinib [92]. Succinate dehydrogenase (SDH)-deficient RCC has a low risk of metastasis (12 %) with exception of high-grade with risk 70 %. Due to rarity of disease, no evidence for systemic therapy [614]. Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-rearranged RCC, there are some reports of the efficacy of ALK inhibitors, e.g. entrectinib [614]. ELOC (formerly TCEB1)-mutated RCC doesnâ€™t exhibit cinically aggressive behaviour [614]. There is no data that indicates a recommendation for one treatment over another.
