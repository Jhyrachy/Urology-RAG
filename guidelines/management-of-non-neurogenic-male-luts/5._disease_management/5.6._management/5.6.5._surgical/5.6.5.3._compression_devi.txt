5.6.5.3. Compression devices in males. 5.6.5.3.1. Artificial urinary sphincter Mechanism of action: The AUS is the standard treatment for moderate-to-severe male SUI. The AMS 800 three component system with inflatable cuff, control pump and pressure regulating balloon is the device with the longest follow-up and the greatest level of evidence [703]. The ZSI 375 is a two-component device, inflatable cuff, and control pump, allowing an easier implantation process [704]. Other AUS devices have been launched e.g., the Victo and Br-SL-AS 904 systems but robust evidence regarding their efficacy and safety is pending [705]. Efficacy A meta-analysis of 33 cohort studies and one RCT, reported significant improvement after AUS implantation in overall cure rates (56%) and reductions in pad used per 24-hours (-3.75) [675]. Several observational studies reported on functional outcomes after AMS 800. Social continence rates (0-1 pads used daily) ranged from 55-76.8% [706-708]. A 77.2% continence rate and 89.5% subjective satisfaction rate have been reported after a median follow-up of > fifteen years in 57 men who had undergone AUS placement [709]. A prospective cohort study of 40 patients with a mean follow-up of 53 months, showed that from all urodynamic parameters only low bladder compliance had a negative impact on outcome [710]. However, another retrospective study showed that no urodynamic factors adversely altered the outcome of AUS implantation [711]. Some multicentre studies have confirmed older statements that surgeon’s experience and higher surgical volume is associated with better outcomes and a lower revision rate after AUS implantation [712,713]. The data regarding ZSI 375 is limited. A retrospective, non-randomised trial across several centres in Europe, reported an 84.4% success rate (19.3% dry rate and 65.1% improved 0-1 pads per day) after 43 months [704]. A 72% success rate was reported at seven years follow-up for 45 patients who underwent placement of the ZSI 375 device in France [714]. A retrospective study on 168 patients receiving AUS (AMS 800 AUS system) placements carried out by a single surgeon from 2008 to 2016 at a high-volume academic institution evaluated the causes of AUS failure at a median follow-up from initial placement of 2.7 year. Overall, 63 patients (37.5%) experienced AUS failure requiring device explant/revision. Pressure-regulating balloon malfunction, cuff malfunction, pump malfunction, urethral atrophy, urethral erosion, and infection occurred in 36.5%, 7.9%, 6.3%, 22.2%, 19.0% and 12.7% of all AUS failures, respectively. History of previous pelvic radiotherapy, urethral stricture, urethral sling placement and coronary artery disease were independent predictors of all-cause AUS failure [715]. A retrospective review of all cases of AUS implantation performed between 2005 and 2020 in sixteen different French centres including patients with primary implantation whose indication was moderate to severe SUI after radical prostatectomy (n= 417) or BPO surgery (n=50) found similar social continence rates (zero or one pad per day) at three months between the groups (79% vs. 72%) [716]. Tolerability and safety: Artificial urinary sphincter complications include device infection/erosion (8.5%), mechanical failure (6.2%) and urethral atrophy (7.9%) [717]. In multivariate analysis, radiation therapy was independently associated with risk of urethral atrophy, as were older age and a longer time interval between prostate cancer treatment and AUS surgery [708]. Urethral erosion is associated with previous irradiation and penoscrotal approach [718]. The reported revision rates at three years for any reason were 10-29.1% [706,718-720]. The risk of urethral erosion after ZSI 375 AUS is 8.2-13.3% and risk of mechanical failure is 2.2-2.5% [704]. A retrospective database comparison found significantly higher complication rates in patients have been reported to be significantly higher in patients undergoing AUS implantation due to UI following BPO surgery compared to patients with post-prostatectomy UI (8% vs. 18%, p=0.044). The same was found for the Clavien-Dindo type 2 complication rate (20.6% vs. 44.4%, p=0.026) [716]. Practical Considerations: Artificial urinary sphincter is efficacious and improves the QoL of men with PPI. To minimise complications, it is advised to refer patients to specialised centres experienced in AUS implementation. Men considering insertion of an AUS should be fully informed that the success of the intervention relies on their ability to operate the pump. Treating physicians should keep in mind that operating the AUS may become difficult in men who develop cognitive impairment or lose manual dexterity. Artificial urinary sphincter has a limited lifespan and ‘maintenance’ re-operations are common in the long-term. These re-interventions should not be classified as complications [703]. 5.6.5.3.2. Non-circumferential compression device (ProACT®) Mechanism of action: The ProACT® system consists of two devices. Each device includes the balloon, the bi-lumen tubing, and the volume-adjustment port. The devices are introduced by a trocar via two small perineal incisions and are placed under fluoroscopic guidance on each side of the bladder neck, close to the vesico-urethral anastomotic site. The balloons can be filled, and their volume can be adjusted post-operatively using a hypodermic needle injected through the intra-scrotal port. Efficacy: A SR and meta-analysis of nineteen studies including 1,264 patients reported a 60.2% dry rate, significant reduction in number of pads used per day (-3.1) and greatly improved QoL scores for ProACT® [721]; however, the level of heterogeneity among the included studies was high. A comparison between ATOMS and ProACT®, showed that the former is associated with higher improvement and satisfaction rates and fewer complications [696]. A quasi-randomised trial comparing ProACT® with bone-anchored male slings found that both resulted in similar improvements in SUI (68% vs. 65%, respectively) [722]. A questionnaire study showed that 50% of patients were still significantly bothered by persistent incontinence following ProACT® [723]. A subgroup analysis of radiotherapy patients reported worst outcomes as compared to patients not receiving radiotherapy (46% vs. 68% success rate) as well as a higher percentage of urethral erosion for ProACT® [724]. Tolerability and safety: The most common intra-operative complication during ProACT® implantation is perforation of the bladder and/or urethra. A meta-analysis estimated a perforation rate of 5.3% [721]. The estimated overall revision rate is 22.2%, and the main causes are erosion (3.8%), device leaking (4.1%) and migration (6.5%) [721]. Other prospective series have shown that adverse events were frequent, leading to an explantation rate of 11-58% [722,723,725-727]. Practical Considerations: ProACT® has a satisfactory rate of success and seems to be a reasonable alternative for the treatment of male UI; however, it is associated with high complication rates.
