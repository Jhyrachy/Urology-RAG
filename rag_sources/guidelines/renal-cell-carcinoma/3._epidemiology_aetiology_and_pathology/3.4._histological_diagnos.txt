3.4. histological diagnosis. renal cell carcinomas renal tumours comprise broad spectrum histopathological entities described 5th edition world health organization (who) classification urogenital tumours published 2022 [22-24]. 5th edition presents standard morphologic diagnostic criteria, combined immunohistochemistry relevant molecular tests significantly revised compared 2016 classification . global application next-generation sequencing (ngs) result diagnostic shift morphology molecular analyses. therefore, molecular-driven renal tumour classification introduced addition morphology-based renal tumours (table 3.1). examples molecularly-defined epithelial renal tumours include smarcb1-deficient renal medullary carcinoma, tfe3- tfeb-rearranged rcc, alk-rearranged rcc, elongin c (eloc)-mutated rcc. profound changes 2022 classification mainly relate rare kidney tumours. three main rcc types: clear cell (ccrcc), papillary (prcc longer divided type ii) chrcc. rcc type classification confirmed cytogenetic genetic analyses (le: 2b). 5-year overall survival (os) non-metastatic (including n0-n1) chromophobe, papillary, clear-cell collecting duct rcc 91%, 82%, 81% 44%, respectively . sarcomatoid rcc specific subtype, essentially represents pattern de-differentiation associated adverse outcome poor cancer-specific survival (css), irrespective underlying rcc subtype; graded who/isup (international society urological pathology) grade iv. multilocular cystic renal neoplasm low malignant potential new subtype crcc 2022 classification. new group “oncocytic chromophobe tumours” encompass oncocytoma together chrcc oncocytic tumours. oncocytic tumours include tumours strictly fit either oncocytoma chrcc subtypes . histological diagnosis includes, besides rcc type; evaluation isup nuclear grade, sarcomatoid features, vascular invasion, tumour necrosis, invasion collecting system peri-renal fat, pt, even pn categories. four-tiered who/isup grading system replaced fuhrman grading system . table 3.1 world health organization classification renal tumours 2022 classification renal tumours 20221. renal cell tumours01.i clear cell renal tumoursclear cell rccmultilocular cystic renal neoplasm low malignant potential01.ii papillary renal tumourspapillary adenomapapillary rcc01.iii oncocytic chromophobe renal tumoursoncocytoma kidneychromophobe rccother oncocytic tumours kidney01.iv collecting duct tumourscollecting duct carcinoma01.v renal tumoursclear cell papillary renal cell tumourmucinous tubular spindle cell carcinomatubulocystic rccacquired cystic disease-associated rcceosinophilic solid cystic (esc) rccrcc nos (not otherwise specified)01.vi molecularly defined renal tumourstfe3-rearranged rccstfeb-altered rcc (tfeb-rearranged rcc tfeb amplified rcc)eloc (formerly tceb1)-mutated rccfumarate hydratase-deficient rccsuccinate dehydrogenase-deficient rccalk-rearranged rccssmarcb1-deficient renal medullary carcinoma2. metanephric tumoursmetanephric adenomametanephric adenofibromametanephric stromal tumour3. mixed epithelial stromal tumour familymixed epithelial stromal tumouradult cystic nephroma4. renal mesenchymal tumours04.i adult renal mesenchymal tumoursclassic angiomyolipoma/pecoma kidneyepitheloid angiomyolipoma/epithelioid pecoma kidneyrenal haemangioblastomajuxtaglomerular cell tumourrenomedullary interstitial cell tumour04.ii paediatric renal mesenchymal tumoursossifying renal tumour infancycongenial mesoblastic nephromarhabdoid tumour kidneyclear cell sarcoma kidney5. embryonal neoplasms kidneynephroblastic tumoursnephrogenic restspediatric cystic nephromacystic partially differentiated nephroblastomanephroblastoma6. miscellaneous tumoursgerm cell tumours kidney 3.4.1. clear-cell rcc overall, ccrcc representing 70% rcc , well circumscribed pseudocapsule. cut surface golden-yellow, often haemorrhage necrosis. loss chromosome 3p mutation von hippel-lindau (vhl) gene chromosome 3p25 frequently found. loss von hippel-lindau protein function contributes tumour initiation, progression, metastases. 3p locus harbours additional ccrcc tumour suppressor genes (utx, jarid1c, setd2, pbrm1, bap1) . details prognosis, see section 6.3. 3.4.1.1. multilocular cystic renal neoplasm low malignant potential (mcnlmp) indolent, exclusively cystic, multiloculated renal tumour devoid expansile solid growth, clear cells lining low grade nuclei. detection small solid expansive nodules tumour necrosis incompatible mcnlmp. represents 0.5-2.5% renal tumours benign lesion. reports progression, metastases cancer-related death long-term follow-up . 3.4.2. papillary rcc papillary rcc (prcc) second-most encountered morphotype rcc accounting 13-20% renal epithelial tumours. usually circumscribed characterised papillary tubulopapillary architecture, without specific features rccs papillary architecture . papillary rcc traditionally subdivided two types; type ii prcc . however, new 2022 classification, former prcc type referred “prcc classic pattern”. three additional morphologic patterns prcc introduced including: a) bi-phasic (alveolo-squamoid) pattern exhibiting mostly solid growth; b) papillary neoplasm reverse nuclear polarity, previously described “oncocytic low-grade prcc”; c) warthin-like prcc exhibits brisk inflammation mimicking warthin tumour salivary gland. genetic changes prcc include trisomies tetrasomies chromosomes 7 17 loss y-chromosome. mesenchymal-epithelial transition (met) gene mutations frequent low-grade prcc. typical histology classical pattern prcc, formally type prcc, (narrow papillae without binding, microcapillaries papillae) explains typical clinical signs. narrow papillae without binding tough pseudo-capsule explain ideal rounded shape (pascal’s law) fragility (specimens “minced meat” structure). tumour growth causes necrotisation papillae, source hyperosmotic proteins cause subsequent “growth” tumour, fluid inside tumour, serpiginous, contrast-enhancing margin. stagnation microcapillaries explains minimal post-contrast attenuation ct. classical pattern prcc imitate pathologically changed cyst (bosniak iif iii). typical signs classical pattern prcc ochre colour, frequently exophytic, extra-renal growth low grade. risk renal tumour biopsy tract seeding exists (12.5%), probably due fragility tumour papillae . 3.4.3. chromophobe rcc chromophobe rcc grouped “oncocytic chromophobe tumours”. chrccs discovered incidentally asymptomatic patients . overall, chrcc presents pale tan, relatively homogenous tough, well-demarcated mass without capsule. tumours sporadic. rare hereditary forms include birt-hogg-dubé (bhd) syndrome mutations folliculin cowden syndrome mutations pten see section 3.5.6 information . chromophobe rcc cannot graded who/isup (formerly fuhrman) grading system innate nuclear atypia. alternative grading system proposed, yet validated . loss chromosomes-y, 1, 2, 6, 10, 13, 17 21 typical genetic changes . prognosis relatively good, high 5-year recurrence-free survival (rfs), 10-year css. five- 10-year rfs rates 94.3% 89.2%, respectively. recurrent disease developed 5.7% patients, 76.5% presented distant metastases 54% metastatic disease diagnoses involving single organ, commonly bone. recurrence death surgically resected chrcc rare. completely excised lesions < pt2a without coagulative necrosis sarcomatoid features, prognosis excellent .
