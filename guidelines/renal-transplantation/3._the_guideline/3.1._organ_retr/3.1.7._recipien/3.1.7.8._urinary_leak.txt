3.1.7.8. Urinary leak. Urinary leakage occurs in 0-9.3% of cases [201]. Anastomotic urine leaks can be ureteral or vesical [202]. Ureteral necrosis and/or suture failure are the most important causes [203,204]. Non-technical risk factors include recipient age, number of renal arteries, site of arterial anastomosis, occurrence of acute rejection episodes, bladder problems, and immunosuppressive regimen [205]. Urinary leak can be suspected by the urine output and the creatinine level in the drain fluid [203]. In order to decrease the risk of ureteral necrosis, it is important to preserve vascularisation of the distal ureter [203]. Furthermore, the routine use of a JJ-stent is recommended [204,206]. The management of urinary leak depends on the location (renal pelvis, proximal or distal ureter, and bladder), the time of appearance and the volume of the leak. For early and low volume urine leaks the treatment may be conservative (i.e. urethral catheter, percutaneous nephrostomy and JJ-stent) [207]. In case of failure of the conservative management, or massive leak, surgical repair must be undertaken. Ureteral re-implantation directly to the bladder or to the native ureter provide similar results [140,207].
