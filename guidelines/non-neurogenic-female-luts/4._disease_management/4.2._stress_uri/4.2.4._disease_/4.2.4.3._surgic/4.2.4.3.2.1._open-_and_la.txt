4.2.4.3.2.1. Open- and laparoscopic colposuspension surgery. Open Burch colposuspension was previously considered the most appropriate surgical intervention for SUI, and was used as the comparator in RCTs of newer, less-invasive surgical techniques. These include laparoscopic techniques, which have enabled colposuspension to be performed with a minimally-invasive approach. Open colposuspension A number of SRs have covered open surgery for SUI, with a large number of RCTs [359,361-364]. The Cochrane review on open colposuspension [364] included 55 trials comprising 5,417 women. In most of these trials, open Burch colposuspension was used as the comparator to an experimental procedure. Within the first year, complete continence rates of 85–90% were achieved for open colposuspension, while failure rates in terms of recurrent UI were 17% up to five years and 21% at > 5 years. The risk of reoperation after Burch colposuspension is estimated at 6% within five years [77] and 10.8% within nine years [365]. The reoperation rate specifically for UI was only 2%. Burch colposuspension was associated with a higher rate of development of enterocoele/vault/cervical prolapse (42%) and rectocele (49%) at five years compared to TVT (23% and 32%, respectively). The rate of cystocoele was similar after Burch colposuspension (37%) and after TVT (41%). The Cochrane review concluded that open colposuspension is an effective treatment for SUI and around 70% of women can expect to be dry at five years after surgery. Laparoscopic colposuspension A Cochrane review reported on twelve trials comparing laparoscopic to open Burch colposuspension [362]. Although these procedures had a similar subjective cure rate, there was limited evidence suggesting the objective outcomes were poorer for laparoscopic colposuspension. The ESTER SR [359], based on a network meta-analysis, showed that at twelve months open colposuspension was more effective than laparoscopic colposuspension (nine trials) but these findings were based on low-quality evidence. The Surface Under the Cumulative Ranking (SUCRA) score, which is a numerical representation of the overall performance of the treatment, and represents a single number associated with each intervention, was 76.7% after open colposuspension and 48.9% after laparoscopic colposuspension. Laparoscopic colposuspension had a shorter duration and subsequent hospital stay and may be slightly more cost-effective when compared with open colposuspension after 24 months’ follow-up. Single-port laparoscopic Burch can be an alternative treatment, although data confirming efficacy are limited [366]. Complications Voiding difficulties are more common after laparoscopic colposuspension than after retropubic MUS (7.5% vs. 5.1%) [359]. There was no difference between open colposuspension and retropubic MUS (7.8% vs. 7.5%; OR: 0.87) [359]. The results for the comparisons of de novo symptoms of urgency or UUI between open colposuspension and retropubic MUS (11% vs. 8%, OR: 1.49) did not favour either treatment and showed wide confidence intervals [359]. The rate of bladder or urethral perforation was higher for laparoscopic colposuspension compared with open colposuspension (3.7% vs. 0.7%; OR: 4.65) [359]. 4.2.4.3.2.1.1.Summary of evidence and recommendation for open and laparoscopic colposuspension surgery Summary of evidenceLEHigh subjective cure rates are associated with both open and laparoscopic colposuspension for treatment of SUI.1aObjective cure rates are higher for open compared to laparoscopic colposuspension.1aColposuspension is associated with a higher long-term risk of POP than MUS.1aLaparoscopic colposuspension has a shorter hospital stay and may be more cost-effective than open colposuspension.1aLaparoscopic colposuspension is associated with higher rates of intraoperative bladder perforation and postoperative voiding dysfunction compared to open colposuspension.1aThe rates of de novo urinary urgency following colposuspension are similar to other surgical treatments for SUI.1a RecommendationStrength ratingOffer colposuspension (open or laparoscopic) to women seeking surgical treatment for SUI following a thorough discussion of the risks and benefits relative to other surgical modalities.Strong
