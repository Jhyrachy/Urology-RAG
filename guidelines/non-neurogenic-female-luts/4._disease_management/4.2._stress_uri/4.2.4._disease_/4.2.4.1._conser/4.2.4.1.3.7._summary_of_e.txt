4.2.4.1.3.7. Summary of evidence and recommendations for pelvic floor muscle training. Summary of evidenceLEPelvic floor muscle training is better than no treatment for improving SUI and QoL in women with SUI and MUI across a range of outcomes, including cure rate, improvement rate, QoL, number and volume of urine leaks and treatment satisfaction.1aPelvic floor muscle training exhibits a low rate of adverse events.1aHigher-intensity, supervised treatment regimens confer greater benefit in women receiving PFMT.1aThere is no extra benefit of combining PFMT with biofeedback.1bShort-term benefits of intensive PFMT can be maintained in the long term.2aPelvic floor muscle training in the antenatal period is associated with a reduced risk of UI in late pregnancy and in the short term postnatally.1aPostpartum PFMT is effective in women with persistent UI.1bThe benefit of postpartum PFMT in mixed populations (continent and incontinent) of women is uncertain.1bMid-urethral sling surgery is superior to PFMT in women with moderate-to-severe SUI.1bPelvic floor muscle training commencing in the early postpartum period improves UI in women for up to six months.1bThere is conflicting evidence on whether the addition of ES increases the effectiveness of PFMT alone.2aThere is low to moderate certainty evidence suggesting benefit of ES in patients with SUI. In addition, ES may be useful for learning a correct PFM contraction.1b RecommendationsStrength ratingOffer supervised intensive pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT), lasting at least three months, as first-line therapy to all women with stress urinary incontinence (SUI) or mixed urinary incontinence (including elderly women and pre- and postnatal women).StrongEnsure that PFMT programmes are as intensive as possible.StrongBalance the efficacy and lack of adverse events from PFMT against the expected effect and complications from invasive surgery for SUI.StrongConsider electrical stimulation for treatment of SUI, or as an adjunct for teaching PFM contraction.Weak
