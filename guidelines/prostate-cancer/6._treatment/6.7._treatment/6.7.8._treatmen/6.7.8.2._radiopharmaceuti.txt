6.7.8.2. Radiopharmaceuticals. 6.7.8.2.1. Introduction Historically, several radiopharmaceuticals including phosphorous-32, strontium-89, yttrium-90, samarium-153, and rhenium-186 were developed for the treatment of bone pain secondary to metastases from PCa [1229]. They proved effective in a palliation setting, by relieving pain and improving QoL, especially in the setting of diffuse bone metastases. However, they never gained widespread adoption. The first radioisotope to demonstrate a survival benefit was radium-223 (see Section 6.7.7.4). 6.7.8.2.2. PSMA-based therapy The increasing use of PSMA PET as a diagnostic tracer and the realisation that this allowed identification of a greater number of metastatic deposits led to attempts to treat cancer by replacing the imaging isotope with a therapeutic isotope which accumulates where the tumour is demonstrated (theranostics) [1230]. Therefore, after identification of the target, usually with diagnostic 68Gallium-labelled PSMA, therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals labelled with β(lutetium-177 or yttrium-90) or α(actinium-225)-emitting isotopes could be used to treat metastatic PCa. The PSMA therapeutic radiopharmaceutical supported by the most robust data is 177Lu-PSMA-617. The first patient was treated in 2014 and early clinical studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of 177Lu-PSMA therapy have demonstrated promising results, despite the fact that a significant proportion of men had already progressed on multiple therapies [1231]. The early data were based on single-centre experience [1232]. Data from uncontrolled prospective phase II trials reported high response rates with low toxic effects [1233,1234]. Positive signals are also coming from a randomised pase II trial (TheraP) [1235]. In TheraPpatients for whom cabazitaxel was considered the next appropriate standard treatment after docetaxel and who were highly selected by 68Ga-PSMA-11 and 18FDG PET-CT scans, were randomised to receive 177Lu-PSMA-617 (6.0–8.5 GBq intravenously, every six weeks, for up to six cycles) or cabazitaxel (20 mg/m2 for up to ten cycles). The primary endpoint was a reduction of at least 50% in PSA. The first endpoint was met (66% vs. 37% for 177Lu–PSMA-617 vs. cabazitaxel, respectively, by intention to treat; difference 29% (95% CI: 16–42; p < 0.0001; and 66% vs. 44% by treatment received; difference 23% [9–37]; p = 0.0016) [1235]. At 36 months follow-up, the secondary endpoint OS was similar in those patients randomly assigned to 177Lu-PSMA versus cabazitaxel (19.1 vs. 19.6 months, difference -0.5, 95% CI -3.7 to + 2.7; 177Lu-PSMA vs. cabazitaxel, respectively), HR: 0.97, 95% CI: 0.7-1.4, p=0.99) [1236]. An open-label phase III trial (VISION) compared 177Lutetium Vipivotid tetraxetan (177Lu-PSMA-617 radioligand therapy) with protocol-permitted SOC (i.e., excluded chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radium-223 and investigational drugs) in mCRPC patients, with PSMA expressing metastases on PET/CT, previously treated with at least one ARPI and one (around 53%) or two taxanes. Imaging-based PFS and OS were the alternate primary endpoints. More than 800 patients were randomised. 177Lu-PSMA-617 plus SOC significantly prolonged both imaging-based PFS and OS, as compared with SOC alone (see Table 6.6.3). Grade 3 or above AEs were higher with 177Lu-PSMA-617 than without (52.7% vs. 38.0%), but QoL was not adversely affected. 177Lu–PSMA-617 has shown to be an additional treatment option in this mCRPC population [1237]. A SR and updated meta-analysis, investigated the proportion of patients with any or more than 50% PSA decrease, and OS. The review, including 69 articles and a total of 4,157 patients, showed that patients treated with 177Lu–PSMA 617 had a significantly higher response to therapy compared to controls, based on ≥ 50% PSA decrease (OR = 5.33, 95% CI: 1.24–22.90, p < 0.05). Meta-analysis revealed an OS of 0.26 according to pooled HRs for any PSA decline, which was significant after 177Lu–PSMA-617 therapy (95% CI: 0.18–0.37, p < 0.00001) and an OS of 0.52 for ≥ 50% PSA decrease, also significant after radioligand (RLT) (95% CI: 0.40–0.67, p < 0.00001) [1238]. There is an increasing interest for PSMA-targeted alpha therapy (225Ac-PSMA) due to the ability to deliver potent higher local radiation more selectively to cancer cells than PSMA-targeted beta therapy, while minimising unwanted damage to the surrounding normal tissues. Additionally, the intensive radiation to cancer cells results in more effective DNA strand breakage and reduces the development of treatment resistance. A meta-analysis, including nine studies with 263 patients, investigated the therapeutic effects of 225Ac-PSMA RLT in patients with metastatic CRPC, pre-treated with chemotherapy, 177Lu-PSMA and/or radium-223. The pooled proportions of patients with more than 50% PSA decline and any PSA decline were 60.99% (95% CI: 54.92%– 66.83%) and 83.57% (95% CI: 78.62%–87.77%), respectively. The estimated mean PFS and mean OS were 9.15 months (95% CI: 6.69–11.03 months) and 11.77 months (95% CI: 9.51–13.49 months), respectively. These findings suggests that 225Ac-PSMA RLT may be an effective treatment option for patients with mCRPC [1239]. Despite the encouraging therapeutic response and survival of patients who received 225Ac-PSMA RLT, major AEs like xerostomia and severe haematotoxicity have to be considered as possible reasons for dose reduction or discontinuation of the therapy.
