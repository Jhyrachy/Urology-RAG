4.2. ureteral trauma. 4.2.1. incidence trauma ureters relatively rare protected small size, mobility, posterior location, adjacent musculoskeletal visceral structures. iatrogenic injury open, laparoscopic endoscopic surgery responsible majority cases . injury often missed intra-operatively may result significant morbidity . 4.2.2. epidemiology, aetiology, pathophysiology overall, ureteral trauma accounts 1-2.5% urinary tract trauma [126,128-130], penetrating external ureteral trauma, mostly gunshot wounds, commonest form modern series, . higher rates ureteral injury seen modern combat injuries . one-third cases external trauma ureters caused blunt trauma, mostly road traffic accidents . ureteral injury suspected cases penetrating abdominal injury, although occurs just2-3% cases . also suspected blunt trauma significant deceleration pelvi-ureteral disruption result. . distribution external ureteral injuries along ureter varies series, commonest upper ureter [128-130]. incidence urological iatrogenic trauma decreased last twenty years due improvements technique, instrument technology, training methods subspecialisation . iatrogenic ureteral trauma result from:- ligation suture,- rushing surgical instrument,- partial complete transection unintended scalpel incision,- thermal injury,- ischaemia devascularisation . injury usually involves lower ureter . gynaecological operations common cause significant iatrogenic trauma (table 4.2.1). also occurs colorectal operations, (resection distal colon) vascular surgery (aortic aneurysm repair) . significant decrease rate ureteral injury robot-assisted procedures colorectal surgery . however, minimally invasive techniques reduced rate ureteral injuries gynaecological surgery [139-141]. ureteroscopy common cause iatrogenic ureteric trauma contributing 71.6% series . post-ureteroscopic lesion scale (puls) aims standardise intra-operative traumatic findings ureteroscopy . predictors high grade ureteric injury include male gender, longer operative times, ureteral access sheath (uas) insertion times . smaller proximal ureter diameter seen ct scanning predictor high-grade ureteral injury ureteral access sheath (uas) placement . small rct using pre-operative silodosin 8 mg three days significantly reduced grade 2 higher ureteral injuries due uas insertion . risk factors iatrogenic trauma include conditions alter normal anatomy, e.g., advanced malignancy, prior surgery irradiation, diverticulitis, endometriosis, anatomical abnormalities, major haemorrhage . occult ureteral injury occurs often

diagnosis diagnosis ureteral trauma challenging; therefore, high index suspicion maintained. penetrating external trauma, best identified intra-operatively laparotomy . diagnosis delayed cases blunt trauma iatrogenic trauma . 4.2.3.1. clinical diagnosis external ureteral trauma usually accompanies severe abdominal pelvic injuries. penetrating trauma usually associated vascular intestinal injuries, blunt trauma associated damage pelvic bones lumbosacral spinal injuries . haematuria unreliable poor indicator ureteral injury, present 50-75% patients . iatrogenic injury may noticed primary procedure, intravenous dye (e.g. indigo carmine) injected exclude ureteral injury. early recognition facilitates immediate repair provides better outcome . however, usually presenting later admission, untoward sequelae ureteral injury - upper tract obstruction, sepsis, abdominal distension, discovered subsequent evidence upper tract obstruction, urinary fistulae formation sepsis. following clinical signs characteristic delayed diagnosis - flank pain, urinary incontinence, vaginal drain urinaryleakage, haematuria, fever, uraemia urinoma. complication rate increases delayed diagnosis . 4.2.3.2. radiological diagnosis multi-phase ct mainstay imaging technique trauma patients. generally, widely available allows multi-phasic assessment structures pelvis abdomen. computed tomography urography (ctu) examination choice ureteral injuries suspected . extravasation contrast medium delayed phase hallmark sign injury. however, hydronephrosis, ascites, urinoma mild ureteral dilation often signs. unclear cases, retrograde antegrade urography best method confirmation . intravenous pyelography, especially one-shot ivp, unreliable diagnosis, negative 60% patients . 4.2.4. prevention iatrogenic trauma prevention iatrogenic trauma ureters depends upon visual identification ureters careful intra-operative dissection proximity . use prophylactic pre-operative ureteral stent insertion assists visualisation palpation used cases higher complexity . probably makes easier detect ureteral injury intra-operatively ; however, associated decrease likelihood ureteric injury . apart evident disadvantages (potential complications, increased surgical time cost), stent may alter location ureter diminish flexibility . retrograde instillation indocyanine green ureters shown safely allow identification preservation complex robotic-assisted colorectal surgeries . 4.2.5. management management ureteral trauma depends many factors including aetiology, severity, location injury. immediate diagnosis ligation injury operation managed de-ligation stent placement. partial injuries repaired immediately stent urinary diversion via nephrostomy tube. stenting helpful provides canalisation may decrease risk stricture . immediate repair complete ureteral injury advisable significantly decreases need secondary tertiary procedures compared delayed repair . ureter mobilised ends spatulated end-to-end anastomosis performed. primary repair uretero-ureterostomy ureteric re-implantation safely performed laparoscopically time iatrogenic injury, good medium-term results . cases unstable trauma patients, ‘damage control’ approach preferred ligation ureter, diversion urine (e.g. via nephrostomy), later delayed definitive repair . national trauma database study reported majority blunt low- high-severity traumatic ureteric injuries stable unstable patients treated nephrostomy stenting . exploratory laparotomy associated traumatic injuries predictor immediate ureteral reconstruction . injuries diagnosed late usually managed first placement nephrostomy tube stent . endo-urological treatment delayed-diagnosed ureteral injuries internal stenting, without dilatation, first step cases. performed either retrogradely antegradely via percutaneous nephrostomy, variable success rate 14-19% [169-171]. open robot-assisted laparoscopic surgical repair necessary case failure . basic principles surgical repair ureteral injury outlined table 4.2.2. wide debridement highly recommended gunshot wound injuries due ‘blast effect’ injury. 4.2.5.1. proximal mid-ureteral injury injuries shorter 2-3 cm usually managed primary uretero-ureterostomy . approach feasible, ureterocalicostomy considered. case large extra-renal pelvis stricture upj, pelvic spiral flap (culp de weerd) option . extensive ureteral loss, transureteroureterostomy valid option. proximal stump ureter transposed across midline anastomosed contralateral ureter. reported stenosis rate 4% re-intervention revision occurs 10% cases . 4.2.5.2. distal ureteral injury distal injuries best managed ureteral re-implantation (ureteroneocystostomy) primary trauma jeopardises blood supply distal ureter. question refluxing vs. non-refluxing ureteral re-implantation remains unresolved literature. risk clinically significant reflux weighed risk ureteral obstruction. psoas hitch bladder ipsilateral psoas tendon usually needed bridge gap protect anastomosis tension. contralateral superior vesical pedicle may divided improve bladder mobility. reported success rate high (97%) . extensive mid-lower ureteral injury, large gap bridged tabularised l-shaped bladder flap (boari flap). time-consuming operation unsuited acute setting. success rate reported 81-88% . 4.2.5.3. long segment ureteral injury longer ureteral injury replaced using segment intestines, usually ileum (ileal interposition graft). avoided patients impaired renal function known intestinal disease. follow-up includes serum chemistry diagnose hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis . long-term complications include anastomotic stricture (3%) fistulae (6%) . another option downward nephropexy long boari

buccal mucosa ureteroplasty option long segment ureteral injury, especially previous failed reconstruction, alternative auto-transplantation. overall success rate 90%, experience limited . 4.2.5.4.
