3.15.1. Epidemiology, aetiology and pathophysiology. Vesicoureteric reflux is an anatomical and/or functional disorder with potentially serious consequences, such as renal scarring, hypertension and renal failure. Patients with VUR present with a wide range of severity, and a good proportion of reflux patients do not develop renal scars and probably do not need any intervention [917]. Vesicoureteric reflux is a very common urological anomaly in children, with an incidence of nearly 1%. Genetic analysis studies revealed monogenic causes for VUR and significant differentiation of innate immunity and epithelial function genes in children with VUR/UTIs compared to controls [918-920]. The main management goal is the preservation of kidney function, by minimising the risk of pyelonephritis. By defining and analysing the risk factors for each patient (i.e. age, sex, reflux grade, LUTD, anatomical abnormalities, and kidney status), it is possible to identify those patients with a potential risk of UTIs and renal scarring. Controversy persists over the optimal management of VUR, particularly the choice of diagnostic procedures, treatment (medical, endoscopic or surgical), and the timing of treatment. Many children present without symptoms of UTI and, because invasive diagnostic procedures are performed only when clinically indicated, the exact prevalence of VUR is unknown. However, the prevalence of VUR in non-symptomatic children has been estimated at 0.4-1.8% [921]. Among infants prenatally identified with hydronephrosis on US, who were screened for VUR, the prevalence was 16.2% (7-35%) [922]. Siblings of children with VUR had a 27.4% (3-51%) risk of also having VUR, whereas the offspring of parents with VUR had a higher incidence of 35.7% (21.2-61.4%) [922]. However, reflux detected by sibling screening is associated with lower grades [827] and significantly earlier resolution [923]. When VUR is discovered in siblings after UTI, it is usually high-grade and associated with a high incidence of reflux nephropathy, particularly if the sibling is male and the grade of reflux was high in the index patient [924]. The incidence of VUR is much higher among children with UTIs (30-50%, depending on age). Urinary tract infections are more common in girls than boys due to anatomical differences. However, among all children with UTIs, boys are more likely to have VUR than girls (29% vs. 14%). Boys also tend to have higher grades of VUR diagnosed at younger ages, although their VUR is more likely to resolve itself [925-928]. There is a clear co-prevalence between LUTD and VUR [929]. Lower urinary tract dysfunction refers to the presence of LUTS, including urge, urge incontinence, weak stream, hesitancy, frequency and UTIs, which reflect the filling and/or emptying dysfunction and may be accompanied with bowel problems [929]. Some studies have described a prevalence of 40-60% for VUR in children with LUTD [930]. A published Swedish Reflux trial has demonstrated LUTD in 34% of patients, and subdivision into groups characteristic of children revealed that 9% had isolated overactive bladder and 24% had voiding phase dysfunction [931]. The spontaneous resolution of VUR is dependent on age at presentation, sex, grade, laterality, mode of clinical presentation, and anatomy [932]. Faster resolution of VUR is more likely with age less than one year at presentation, lower grade of reflux (grade 1-3), and asymptomatic presentation with prenatal hydronephrosis or sibling reflux. The overall resolution rate is high in congenital high-grade VUR during the first years of life. In several Scandinavian studies, the complete resolution rate for high-grade VUR has been reported at > 25%, which is higher than the resolution rate for VUR detected after infancy [931,933,934]. The presence of renal cortical abnormality, bladder dysfunction, and breakthrough febrile UTIs are negative predictive factors for reflux resolution [935-937]. Dilating VUR increases the risk of developing acute pyelonephritis and renal scarring. Untreated recurrent UTIs may have a negative impact on somatic growth and medical status of the child. Evidence of renal scarring is present in 10-40% of children with symptomatic VUR, resulting from either congenital dysplasia and/or acquired post-infectious damage, which may have a negative impact on somatic growth and general well-being [938-940]. Scar rates vary in different patient groups. Patients with higher grades of VUR present with higher rates of renal scars. In those with prenatal hydronephrosis, renal scarring occurs in 10% of patients [941-946], whereas in patients with LUTD, this may increase up to 30% [704,940,947]. Renal scarring may adversely affect renal growth and function, with bilateral scarring increasing the risk of insufficiency. Reflux nephropathy (RN) may be the most common cause of childhood hypertension. Follow-up studies have shown that 10-20% of children with RN develop hypertension or end-stage renal disease [948].
