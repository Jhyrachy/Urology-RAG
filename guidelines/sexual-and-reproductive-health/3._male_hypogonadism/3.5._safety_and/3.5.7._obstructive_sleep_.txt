3.5.7. Obstructive Sleep Apnoea. There is no evidence that testosterone therapy can result in the onset or worsening of sleep apnoea. Combined therapy with Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) and testosterone gel was more effective than CPAP alone in the treatment of obstructive sleep apnoea [186]. In one RCT, testosterone therapy in men with severe sleep apnoea reported a reduction in oxygen saturation index and nocturnal hypoxaemia after seven weeks of therapy compared to placebo, but this change was not evident after eighteen weeksâ€™ treatment and there was no association with baseline testosterone levels [187].
