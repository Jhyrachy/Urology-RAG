3.13. Fournier’s Gangrene (Necrotising fasciitis of the perineum and external genitalia). 3.13.1. Epidemiology, Aetiology and Pathophysiology Fournier’s gangrene is an aggressive and frequently fatal polymicrobial soft tissue infection of the perineum, peri-anal region, and external genitalia [412]. It is an anatomical sub-category of necrotising fasciitis with which it shares a common aetiology and management pathway. 3.13.2. Diagnostic Evaluation Typically, there is painful swelling of the scrotum or perineum with sepsis [412]. Examination shows small necrotic areas of skin with surrounding erythema and oedema. Crepitus on palpation and a foul-smelling exudate occurs with more advanced disease. Patient risk factors for occurrence and mortality include being immunocompromised, most commonly diabetes or malnutrition, recent urethral or perineal surgery, and high body mass index (BMI). In up to 40% of cases, the onset is more insidious with undiagnosed pain often resulting in delayed treatment [413]. A high index of suspicion and careful examination, particularly of obese patients, is required. Computed tomography or MRI can help define para-rectal involvement, suggesting the need for bowel diversion [412]. 3.13.3. Disease Management The degree of internal necrosis is usually vastly greater than suggested by external signs, and consequently, adequate, repeated surgical debridement with urinary diversion by suprapubic catheter is necessary to reduce mortality [412]. Consensus from case series suggests that surgical debridement should be early (< 24 hours) and complete, as delayed and/or inadequate surgery may result in higher mortality [412]. Immediate empiric parenteral antibiotic treatment should be given that covers all probable causative organisms and can penetrate inflammatory tissue. A suggested regime would comprise a broad-spectrum penicillin or third-generation cephalosporin, gentamicin and metronidazole or clindamycin [412]. This can then be refined, guided by microbiological culture. 3.13.4. Evidence Summary A systematic literature search from 1980 to July 2017 was performed. From 640 references one RCT [414], two systematic reviews [415,416], one narrative review [412], three registry studies [417-419], one prospective cohort study [420] and two retrospective comparative cohort studies with at least 25 patients [421,422] were selected. The three registry studies from the United States [417-419], found mortality rates of 10%, 7.5% and 5% from 650, 1,641 and 9,249 cases, respectively. Older age, diabetes and high BMI were associated with higher risk. A prospective cohort study showed that disease-specific severity scores did predict outcome, but were not superior to generic scoring systems for critical care [420]. The evidence questions addressed were: What is the best antimicrobial treatment strategy to reduce mortality?What is the best debridement and reconstruction strategy to reduce mortality and aid recovery?Are there any effective adjuvant treatments that improve outcome? Concerning the evidence questions: A low-quality retrospective case series [421] with 168 patients found no significant difference in mortality between patients given ≤ 10 days of parenteral antibiotics (80 patients) and those given > 10 days (88 patients).A systematic review of wound closure techniques [416] found low-quality evidence from 16 case series involving 425 male patients. They recommended primary or secondary wound closure for scrotal defects ≤ 50% with the use of flaps or skin grafts for defects involving > 50% of the scrotum or with extension outside the scrotum.A systematic review on the use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy [415] included three comparative case series and four other case series. All were retrospective and published prior to 2000. No consistent evidence of benefit was found; an RCT was advised. A more recent comparative case series [422] suggested benefit for use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy in 16 patients compared to 12 cases without use of such therapy in terms of reduced mortality and fewer debridements (low quality evidence). A low-quality RCT [414] with 30 patients found that use of honey-soaked dressings resulted in a shorter hospital stay (28 vs. 32 days) than dressing soaked with Edinburgh solution of lime (EUSOL). We found no evidence of benefit for use of negative-pressure (vacuum) wound therapy in Fournier’s gangrene. 3.13.5.
