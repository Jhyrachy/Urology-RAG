associated infections. nosocomial urosepsis may reduced measures used prevent nosocomial infection, e.g. reduction hospital stay, early removal indwelling urinary catheters, avoidance unnecessary urethral catheterisation, correct use closed catheter systems, attention simple daily aseptic techniques avoid cross-infection. sepsis diagnosed clinical evidence infection accompanied signs systemic inflammation, presence symptoms organ dysfunction persistent hypotension associated tissue anoxia (table 6). 3.9.2. epidemiology, aetiology pathophysiology urinary tract infections manifest bacteriuria limited clinical symptoms sepsis severe sepsis, depending localised potential systemic extension. important note patient move almost harmless state severe sepsis short time. mortality rates associated sepsis vary depending organ source urinary tract sepsis generally lower mortality sources . sepsis common men women . recent years, overall incidence sepsis arising sources increased 8.7% per year , associated mortality decreased, suggests improved management patients (total in-hospital mortality rate fell 27.8% 17.9% 1995 2000) . although rate sepsis due gram-positive fungal organisms increased, gram-negative bacteria remain predominant urosepsis . urosepsis, types sepsis, severity depends mostly upon host response. patients likely develop urosepsis include elderly patients, diabetics, immunosuppressed patients, transplant recipients patients receiving cancer chemotherapy corticosteroids. urosepsis also depends local factors, urinary tract calculi, obstruction level urinary tract, congenital uropathy, nlutd, endoscopic manoeuvres. however, patients affected bacterial species capable inducing inflammation within urinary tract. patients likely develop

monitoring may useful patients likely develop sepsis differentiate severe inflammatory status due bacterial infection . addition, serum lactate marker organ dysfunction associated mortality sepsis . serum lactate therefore also monitored patients severe infections. 3.9.5. disease management 3.9.5.1. prevention septic shock frequent cause death patients hospitalised community-acquired nosocomial infection (20-40%). urosepsis treatment requires combination treatment including source control (obstruction urinary tract), adequate life-support care, appropriate antimicrobial therapy . situation, recommended urologists collaborate intensive care infectious disease specialists best management patient. 3.9.5.1.1. preventive measures proven probable efficacy effective methods prevent nosocomial urosepsis used prevent nosocomial infections include: isolation patients multi-resistant organisms following local national recommendations.prudent use antimicrobial agents prophylaxis treatment established infections, avoid selection resistant strains. antibiotic agents chosen according predominant pathogens given site infection hospital environment.reduction hospital stay. long inpatient periods surgery lead greater incidence nosocomial infections.early removal indwelling urethral catheters, soon allowed patient’s condition. nosocomial utis promoted bladder catheterisation well ureteral stenting . antibiotic prophylaxis prevent stent colonisation, appears 100% patients permanent ureteral stent 70% temporarily stented.use closed catheter drainage minimisation breaks integrity system, e.g. urine sampling bladder wash-out.use least-invasive methods release urinary tract obstruction patient stabilised.attention simple everyday techniques assure asepsis, including routine use protective disposable gloves, frequent hand disinfection, using infectious disease control measures prevent cross-infections. 3.9.5.1.2. appropriate peri-operative antimicrobial prophylaxis appropriate peri-operative antimicrobial prophylaxis see section 3.15. potential side effects antibiotics must considered administration prophylactic regimen. 3.9.5.2. treatment early goal-directed resuscitation initially shown improve survival emergency department patients presenting septic shock randomised, controlled, single-centre study . however, follow-up studies improved emergency medicine background achieved positive effects strategy [298-300]. individual patient data meta-analysis later three multicentre trials concluded early goal-directed therapy result better outcomes

management sepsis following : fluid therapy crystalloids, albumin, crystalloids adequately increasing blood pressure: passive leg raising-induced changes cardiac output arterial pulse pressure predictors fluid responsiveness adults ;as vasopressors norepinephrine used primarily, dobutamine myocardial dysfunction;hydrocortisone given fluid vasopressors achieve mean arterial pressure ≥ 65 mmhg;blood products given target haemoglobin level 7-9 g/dl;mechanical ventilation applied tidal volume 6 ml/kg plateau pressure ≤ 30 cm h2o high positive end-expiratory pressure;sedation given minimally, neuromuscular blocking agents avoided;glucose levels target ≤ 180 mg/dl;deep vein thrombosis prevention given low-molecular weight heparin subcutaneously;stress ulcer prophylaxis applied patients risk, using proton pump inhibitors;enteral nutrition started early (< 48 hours). conclusion, sepsis urology remains severe situation considerable mortality rate. recent campaign, ‘surviving sepsis guidelines’, aims reduce mortality 25% next years . early recognition symptoms may decrease mortality timely treatment urinary tract disorders, e.g. obstruction, urolithiasis. adequate
