3.16.4.2. percutaneous nephrolithotomy. shockwave lithotripsy first choice treating renal paediatric stones. however, percutaneous renal surgery used larger complex stones. pre-operative evaluation, indication surgical technique similar children adults. cases, percutaneous nephrolithotomy (pcnl) used monotherapy, also used adjunctive procedure therapies. use adult-sized instruments, association increased number tracts sheath size, seems increase blood loss. however, development small-calibre instruments (minipcnl, ultraminipcnl, superminipcnl microperc) means pcnl used children. miniaturised pcnl several advantages compared standard pcnl, smaller skin incision, single-step dilation sheath placement, good working access paediatric instruments, variable length, lower cost [1136-1138]. monotherapy, pcnl considerably effective safe. reported stone-free rates recent literature 86.9% 98.5% single session. rates increase adjunctive measures, second-look pcnl, swl urs. even complete staghorn cases, clearance rate 89% achieved following single session [1139-1144]. mean post-operative hospital stay one four days much shorter open surgery . less invasive nature technique made superior open surgery treating renal stones children [1146-1153]. frequently reported complications pcnl children bleeding, post-operative fever infection, persistent urinary leakage. bleeding requiring transfusion reported less 10% [1149,1152,1154-1157] closely associated stone burden, operative time, sheath size number tracts . recent studies, post-operative infectious complications, fever without documented uti, reported less 15% origin fever always found infection. due smaller size probes, laser energy easier use smaller instruments useful paediatric cases [1139,1160-1162]. using high power laser (> 40 w) pcnl feasible may helpful treatment staghorn stones , kept mind, increased temperatures inside smaller paediatric kidney might lead tissue damage, shown simulation models . availability smaller size instruments, miniaturised pcnl (‘miniperc’) 13f 14f sheath well ultramini-pcnl (ump) 12f sheaths become possible, decreased transfusion rates . mini- supermini- pcnl (smp) shown higher efficacy low complication rates (< clavien grade 3b) deemed safe alternative swl authors . study, 108 children 12 years old single stone (10-20mm) renal pelvis calyces randomised two groups; either minipcnl swl. stone-free rate (sfr) single session significantly higher pcnl (88.9%) compared swl (55.6%) . second third sessions, swl success increased 88.8% . complication rates 22.2% pcnl 14.8% swl without statistical significance. smp shown advantageous mini-pcnl terms complications similar stone-free rates . miniaturisation developed technique ‘micro-perc’ using 4.85f ‘all-seeing needle’. technique enables stone fragmented laser situ left spontaneous passage . study revealed microperc provides similar sfr similar complication rates lower additional treatment rate compared swl treatment kidney stone disease children . stones 10-20 mm, micro-pcnl shown comparable results, less bleeding, compared mini-pcnl similar outcomes less anaesthetic sessions compared rirs . experience accumulated adult cases, new approaches started applied children, including tubeless pcnl. technique used uncomplicated surgery stones < 2 cm, patients left either indwelling catheter double j stent ureter totally tubeless . moreover, use us establishment access gaining popularity . traditionally, pcnl children performed prone position. another trend literature performance pcnl flank-free modified supine position children . proposed advantages shorter operative time enabling simultaneous ureteroscopic procedure without changing position patient. recent study, 55 paediatric patients kidney stones underwent ump randomised two groups; flank-free modified supine position (ffms) versus prone position. stone free rates complications rates similar operative time found shorter supine position . post-operative pain management, two randomised controlled trials showed intercostal nerve block erector spinae bloc shown provide effective post-operative analgesia paediatric patients .
