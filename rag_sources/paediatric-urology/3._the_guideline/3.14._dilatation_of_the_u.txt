3.14. dilatation upper urinary tract (upj uvj obstruction). 3.14.1. epidemiology, aetiology pathophysiology dilatation upper urinary tract (uut) remains significant clinical challenge deciding patient benefit treatment. ureteropelvic junction (upj) obstruction defined impaired urine flow pelvis proximal ureter subsequent dilatation collecting system potential damage kidney. common pathological cause neonatal hydronephrosis . overall incidence 1:1,500 ratio males females 2:1 newborns. ureterovesical junction (uvj) obstruction obstructive condition distal ureter enters bladder, commonly called primary obstructive megaureter. megaureters second likely cause pathological neonatal hydronephrosis. occur often males likely occur left side . difficult define ‘obstruction’ clear division ‘obstructed’ ‘non-obstructed’ urinary tracts. currently, popular definition obstruction represents restriction urinary outflow that, left untreated, cause progressive renal deterioration . 3.14.2. diagnostic evaluation widespread use us pregnancy resulted higher detection rate antenatal hydronephrosis . challenge management dilated uut decide child observed, managed medically, requires surgical intervention. despite wide range diagnostic tests, single test accurately distinguish obstructive non-obstructive cases (see figure 10). 3.14.2.1. antenatal ultrasound usually 16th 18th weeks pregnancy, kidneys visualised routinely, almost amniotic fluid consists urine. sensitive time foetal urinary tract evaluation 28th week. dilatation detected, us focus on: laterality, severity dilatation, echogenicity kidneys;hydronephrosis hydro-ureteronephrosis;bladder volume bladder emptying;sex child;amniotic fluid volume . 3.14.2.2. postnatal ultrasound since transitory neonatal dehydration lasts 48 hours birth, imaging performed following period postnatal oliguria. however, severe cases (bilateral dilatation, solitary kidney, oligohydramnios), immediate postnatal sonography recommended . ultrasound assess anteroposterior diameter renal pelvis, calyceal dilatation, kidney size, thickness parenchyma, cortical echogenicity, ureters, bladder wall residual urine. 3.14.2.3. voiding cystourethrogram newborns identified uut dilatation, primary important associated factors must detected include: vesicoureteral reflux (found 25% affected children) ;urethral valves;ureteroceles;diverticula;neurogenic bladder. conventional vcug method choice primary diagnostic procedures . 3.14.2.4.diuretic renography diuretic renography commonly used diagnostic tool detect severity functional significance problems urine transport. technetium-99m (99mtc) mercaptoacetyltriglycine (mag3) radionuclide choice. important perform study standardised circumstances

prenatal management counselling caregivers affected child one important aspects care. prognosis hopeful hydronephrotic kidney, even severely affected, may still capable meaningful renal function, unlike severely hypoplastic dysplastic kidney. important able tell caregivers exactly definitive diagnosis child diagnosis mean. cases, however, immediately obvious child severely affected; evidence massive bilateral dilatation, bilateral hypoplastic dysplasia, progressive bilateral dilatation oligohydramnios, pulmonary hypoplasia. intrauterine intervention rarely indicated performed well-experienced centres . 3.14.3.1.1. antibiotic prophylaxis antenatal hydronephrosis benefits harms continous antibiotic prophylaxis (cap) vs. observation patients antenatal hydronephrosis controversial. currently, two rcts published, one pilot trial publication available congress abstract . publications present incomplete data outcomes. panel conducted sr assessing literature 1980

antenatal hydronephrosis remain unproven. uncircumcised infants infants hydroureteronephrosis highgrade hydronephrosis likely develop uti. continuous antibiotic prophylaxis reserved sub-group children proven high risk. 3.14.3.2. upj obstruction important management decisions made basis serial investigations used technique performed institution standardised circumstances. according cochrane review, non-surgical management unilateral upj obstruction infants less two years old also option. however high risk bias included studies limits evidence systematic review . symptomatic obstruction (recurrent flank pain, uti) requires surgical correction using pyeloplasty, according standardised open technique hynes anderson . experienced hands, laparoscopic retroperitoneoscopic techniques robot-assisted techniques success rates standard open procedures. asymptomatic cases, conservative follow-up treatment choice. recent interventional study suggested that, operated infants less six months, inserting stent (transanastomotic stent) decreases complication rates compared stentless approach . however results taken cautiously since successful reported stentless procedures age groups. indications surgical intervention comprise impaired split renal function (< 40%), decrease split renal function > 10% subsequent studies, poor drainage function administration furosemide, increased

reviewed chapter 3.15.3. 3.14.3.3.1. non-operative management functional study reveals confirms adequate ureteral drainage, conservative management best option. initially, low-dose prophylactic antibiotics within first year life recommended prevention utis, although existing prospective randomised trials evaluating benefit regimen . spontaneous remission rates 85% primary megaureter cases, surgical management longer recommended, except megaureters recurrent utis, deterioration split renal function significant obstruction . 3.14.3.3.2. surgical management general, surgery indicated symptomatic children, drop function conservative follow-up hydroureteronephrosis increasing . data suggest children ureteric diameter > 10-15 mm likely require intervention . initial approach ureter either intravesical, extravesical combined. straightening ureter necessary without devascularisation. ureteral tapering enhance urinary flow bladder. ureter must tapered achieve diameter anti-reflux repair. several tailoring techniques exist, ureteral imbrication excisional tapering . institutions perform endoscopic stenting, still long-term data prospective randomised trials confirm outcome. systematic review assessed success rates endoscopic management primary obstructive megaureters . reported endoscopic managements including; stent placement, balloon dilatation incision alternative treatment patients > 1 years age. one third patients required surgical correction. furthermore, long-term outcome endoscopic management still unknown. therefore eau paediatric urology guidelines panel recommend endoscopic management routinely since type intervention management outcomes unclear. 3.14.4. conclusion use routine perinatal sonography resulted increased detection hydronephrosis caused upj uvj obstruction. meticulous repeat postnatal evaluation mandatory try identify obstructive cases risk renal deterioration requiring surgical reconstruction. surgical methods standardised good
