6.3.2. Treatment of intermediate-risk disease. When managed with non-curative intent, intermediate-risk PCa is associated with 10-year and 15-year PCSM rates of 13.0% and 19.6%, respectively [841]. These estimates are based on systematic biopsies and may be overestimated in the era of MRI-targeted biopsies. 6.3.2.1. Active Surveillance In the ProtecT trial, where 34% of the randomised patients had a D’Amico intermediate- or high-risk disease, there was no statistically significant difference in CSS at 15 years [474]. In the comprehensive characterisation of the patients in the ProtecT trial, treatment received, PSA, ISUP grade group at diagnosis, cT stage, risk group, number of PCa-involved biopsy cores, maximum length of tumour (median 5.0 vs. 3.0 mm), aggregate length of tumour (median 8.0 vs. 4.0 mm), and presence of perineural invasion were each associated with increased risk of disease progression (p < 0.001 for each). However, these factors could not reliably predict progression in individuals [487]. The outcomes of AS in intermediate-risk PCa has also been analysed in three SRs and meta-analyses, summarising available data on its oncological outcomes and comparing patients with intermediate-risk PCa to patients with low-risk disease [766-768]. The definition of AS was not strictly defined in either of the reviews: instead, the search strategies included ‘active surveillance’ as a search term, and no a priori study protocol was available. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who remained on AS, whilst secondary outcomes included CSS, OS, and MFS in all three studies. In the first review 17 studies were included, incorporating 6,591 patients with intermediate risk disease. Sixteen studies included patients with low- and intermediate-risk disease, hence enabling comparative outcome assessment via pooled analysis. Only one study performed MRI at recruitment and during AS. There was significant clinical heterogeneity in terms of inclusion criteria for intermediate-risk disease. The results showed the proportion of patients who remained on AS was comparable between the low- and intermediate-risk groups after ten- and fifteen-years’ follow-up (OR: 0.97, 95% CI: 0.83–1.14; and OR: 0.86, 95% CI: 0.65–1.13, respectively). Cancer-specific survival was worse in the intermediate-risk group after ten years (OR: 0.47, 95% CI: 0.31–0.69) and 15 years (OR: 0.34, 95% CI: 0.2–0.58). Overall survival was not statistically significantly different at five years’ follow-up (OR: 0.84, 95% CI: 0.45–1.57) but was significantly worse in the intermediate-risk group after ten years (OR: 0.43, 95% CI: 0.35–0.53). Metastases-free survival did not significantly differ after five years (OR: 0.55, 95% CI: 0.2–1.53) but was worse in the intermediate-risk group after ten years (OR: 0.46, 95% CI: 0.28–0.77) [768]. The second review, including 25 studies and a total of 29,673 low- or intermediate-risk patients, showed similar results in terms of treatment-free survival at ten years (RR: 1.16, 95% CI: 0.99-1.36), risk of developing metastases (RR: 5.79, 95% CI: 4.61-7.29), risk of dying from PCa (RR: 3.93, 95% CI: 2.93-5.27) and risk of dying from any cause (RR: 1.44, 95% CI: 1.11-1.86) [766]. The third, most recent, review included 25 studies of which thirteen studies provided data on treatment free survival, six on CSS and seven on OS. Treatment free survival was not statistically significantly different in the intermediate risk group after 5 (RR: 0.92, 95% CI: 0.82-1.02), 10 (RR: 0.83, 95% CI: 0.55-1.23) or 15 years (RR: 0.54, 95% CI: 0.21-1.39). Cancer-specific survival was significantly lower after 15 years (RR: 0.92, 95% CI: 0.89-0.96) and OS was significantly lower after ten years (RR: 0.87, 95% CI: 0.82-0.93) in the intermediate risk group. It should be noted that many of the studies included patients with ISUP grade group 3 disease. When these studies were excluded no difference in treatment free, cancer specific or OS could be observed [767]. In a subgroup analysis of four studies comparing outcomes of patients with intermediate- and low-risk PCa of ISUP grade group ≤ 2 (n = 1,900) no statistically significant difference could be found in terms of treatment free survival or risk of developing metastases (RR: 1.03, 95% CI: 0.62-1.71 and RR: 2.09, 95% CI: 0.75-5.82, respectively). Both reviews indicate that AS in unselected intermediate-risk patients implies a higher risk of progression over time. It remains unclear whether this difference only reflects the inborne difference in outcome, that can also be seen when comparing immediate treatment of low- and intermediate-risk PCa, or if the delay in treatment caused any worsening of the outcomes in the intermediate-risk group in any way. All three reviews conclude that AS could be offered to patients with intermediate-risk disease, but they should be informed of a higher risk of progression and the latter two reviews suggests limiting the inclusion of intermediate-risk patients to those with low-volume ISUP grade group 2 disease. A Canadian consensus group proposes that low volume ISUP grade group 2 (< 10% Gleason pattern 4 on systematic biopsies) may also be considered for AS. These recommendations have been endorsed by the ASCO [225] and the DETECTIVE study consensus [330] for those patients with a PSA < 10 ng/mL and low core positivity. The DETECTIVE Study concluded that men with favourable ISUP grade group 2 PCa (PSA < 10 ng/mL, low density, clinical stage ≤ cT2a and a low number of positive systematic cores) should also be considered for deferred treatment [330]. In this setting, re-biopsy within six to twelve months to exclude sampling error is even more relevant than in low-risk disease [492,769]. The DETECTIVE Study-related qualitative SR aimed to determine appropriate criteria for inclusion of intermediate-risk disease into AS protocols [491]. Out of 371 AS protocols included in the review, more than 50% included patients with intermediate-risk disease on the basis of PSA up to 20 ng/mL (25.3%), ISUP grade group 2 or 3 (27.7%), clinical stage cT2b/c (41.6%) and/or direct use of D’Amico risk grouping of intermediate risk or above (51.1%). The DETECTIVE study reached consensus that patients with ISUP grade group 3, or patients with intraductal or cribriform histology, should not be considered for AS. The presence of any grade 4 pattern is associated with a 3-fold increased risk of metastases compared to ISUP grade group 1, while a PSA up to 20 ng/mL might be an acceptable threshold [769-771], especially in the context of low PSA-D. In addition, it is likely that MRI and targeted biopsies will detect small foci of Gleason grade 4 cancer that might have been missed with systematic biopsy. Therefore, care must be taken when explaining this treatment strategy, especially to patients with the longest life expectancy. There is no clear consensus on how to interpret MRI and targeted biopsies for AS but the DETECTIVE study consensus was that if targeted biopsies based upon mpMRI images are performed, the number of positive cores of the targeted biopsies are not an indicator of the extent of disease or tumour volume. Indicator of the tumour volume may be either the number of positive cores, and the length of cancer in each core, based on systematic biopsies, or the volume of the dominant lesion seen on mpMRI [330]. In summary, AS can be considered in patients with a life expectancy of more than ten years and low-volume ISUP grade group 2 (defined as ≤ 3 positive systematic cores and ≤ 50% core involvement) or another single element of intermediate-risk disease (i.e. favourable intermediate-risk disease). Patients with ISUP grade group 3 disease, or patients with intraductal or cribriform histology, should be excluded. The monitoring schedule should be diligent, given the potential higher risk of progression, development of regional or distant metastases and death of this group compared with patients with low-risk disease. During monitoring, if repeat non-MRI-based systematic biopsies reveal > 3 positive cores or maximum CI > 50%/core of ISUP grade group 2 disease, patients should be reclassified (i.e., actively treated). For patients with a life expectancy of less than ten years, and not suitable for curative treatment, WW is a valid option and should be discussed with the patient. 6.3.2.2. Radical prostatectomy Patients with intermediate-risk PCa should be informed about the results of two RCTs (SPCG-4 and PIVOT) comparing RRP vs. WW in localised PCa. In the SPCG-4 study, death from any cause (RR: 0.71, 95% CI: 0.53–0.95), death from PCa (RR: 0.38, 95% CI: 0.23–0.62) and distant metastases (RR: 0.49, 95% CI: 0.32–0.74) were significantly reduced in intermediate-risk PCa at 18 years. In the PIVOT trial, according to a pre-planned subgroup analysis among men with intermediate-risk tumours, RP significantly reduced all-cause mortality (HR: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.49–0.98), but not death from PCa (0.50, 95% CI: 0.21–1.21) at ten years. A meta-analysis based on the findings of SPCG-4, PIVOT and ProtecT demonstrated a benefit from RP over observation with a significantly decreased risk of death of 9% and of disease progression of 43% [772]. However, no stratification by disease stages was performed. The risk of having positive LNs in intermediate-risk PCa is between 3.7–20.1% [773]. A large study only found 2.9% of LN invasion in a contemporary cohort of 6,883 patients undergoing RP and LND for intermediate risk PCa [774]. Nerve sparing surgery is discussed in Section 6.1.2.3.5. 6.3.2.3. Radiation therapy 6.3.2.3.1. Recommended IMRT/VMAT for intermediate-risk PCa Patients suitable for ADT can be given combined IMRT/VMAT with short-term ADT (four to six months) [775-777]. The RTOG 0815 RCT demonstrated improved BFSR, metastasis free and prostate CSS with the addition of six months ADT to dose escalated RT [685]. For adjuvant RT of the pelvic lymphatics (45-50 Gy) for NCCN unfavourable intermediate risk (cN0) see Section 6.2.3.2.1 - Radiotherapy for localised high-risk PCa. For patients unsuitable (e.g., due to comorbidities) or unwilling to accept ADT (e.g., to preserve their sexual health) the recommended treatment is IMRT/VMAT (76–78 Gy or equivalent moderate HFX) or a combination of IMRT/VMAT and BT as described below (see Section 6.2.2.3.2). A secondary analysis of the PCS III trial has suggested that patients with NCCN favourable intermediate-risk disease (see Section 4.4) can safely omit ADT if their RT dose is 76 Gy, but this is based on an unplanned subgroup analysis and only 138 patients had favourable intermediate-risk disease. An individual discussion between the physician and the patient of the possible benefits and harms of omitting ADT in this group is essential [778]. 6.3.2.3.2. Brachytherapy for intermediate-risk PCa Systematic review recommends LDR BT monotherapy can be offered to patients with NCCN favourable intermediate-risk disease and good urinary function (see Section 4.4) [779]. Fractionated HDR BT as monotherapy can be offered to selected patients with intermediate-risk PCa although they should be informed that results are only available from small series in very experienced centres. Five-year PSA control rates over 90% are reported, with late grade 3+ GU toxicity rates < 5% and no, or very minimal, grade 3+ GI toxicity rates [728]. There are no direct data to inform on the use of ADT in this setting. Trimodality therapy with IMRT plus BT boost and short-term ADT can be considered for NCCN unfavourable intermediate-risk PCa (see Section 4.4) but patients should be made aware that the potential improvements in biochemical control are accompanied with an increased risk of long-term urinary problems [717,719,724]. 6.3.2.4. Other options for the primary treatment of intermediate-risk PCa (experimental therapies) 6.3.2.4.1. Focal therapy A prospective study on focal therapy using HIFU in patients with localised intermediate-risk disease was published but the data was derived from an uncontrolled single-arm case series [750]. There is a paucity of high-certainty data for either whole-gland or focal ablative therapy in the setting of intermediate-risk disease. Consequently, neither whole-gland ablative treatment nor focal treatment can be considered as standard therapy for intermediate-risk patients and, if offered, it should only be in the setting of clinical trials or prospective registries [736]. 6.3.2.4.2. Androgen deprivation therapy monotherapy Data regarding the use of ADT monotherapy for intermediate-risk disease have been inferred indirectly from the EORTC 30891 trial, which was a RCT comparing deferred ADT vs. immediate ADT in 985 patients with T0–4 N0–2 M0 disease [773]. The trial showed a small, but statistically significant, difference in OS in favour of immediate ADT monotherapy but there was no significant difference in CSS, predominantly because the risk of cancer-specific mortality was low in patients with PSA < 8 ng/mL. Consequently, the use of ADT monotherapy for this group of patients is not considered as standard, even if they are not eligible for radical treatment. 6.3.2.5.
