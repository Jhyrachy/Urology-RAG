6.3.2.1.“Short” bulbar strictures. The length of a “short” bulbar stricture is poorly defined. In general, “short bulbar strictures” are those amenable to stricture excision and subsequent tension-free anastomotic repair. The limit is usually around 2 cm [315]. In fit patients, the choice of urethroplasty is between EPA (transecting or non-transecting) and FGU. 6.3.2.1.1. Excision and primary anastomosis 6.3.2.1.1.1. Excision and primary anastomosis with transection of corpus spongiosum (transecting EPA) Transecting EPA (tEPA) is based on the full thickness resection of the segment of the bulbar urethra where the stricture and surrounding spongiofibrosis is located. Reconstruction is performed by a tension-free spatulated anastomosis. 6.3.2.1.1.1.1.Patency rates The International Consultation on Urological Diseases (ICUD) performed an extensive review of the literature and reported a composite patency rate of 93.8% for tEPA [316]. Based on this, they endorsed tEPA as treatment of choice for short bulbar strictures if other techniques have an expected patency rate below 90%. However, penile complicationswere not taken into account for this advice and as discussed below, these are a concern with tEPA. Prospective data report a patency rate of 88% at twelve months follow-up [315]. Usually, no need for further intervention is used to evidence that the urethra is patent. In the few studies using an anatomic definition for failure (an inability to pass a 16 Fr endoscope) tEPA urethroplasty achieves a similar patency rate, ranging between 85.5-97% [145,317-319] (Table 6.12). The median time for recurrence after tEPA is between 3.5 and thirteen months [145,320,321]. Several authors suggested that tEPA is the technique of choice for short post-traumatic bulbar strictures with complete obliteration of the urethral lumen and full thickness spongiofibrosis [319,322]. These strictures are a specific entity and usually the result of a straddle injury with complete or nearly complete rupture of the bulbar urethra. These obliterations are predominantly short and can be treated with tEPA yielding a patency rate of 98.5% as reported in the series of Horiguchi et al., [323]. They also reported an improvement in erectile function after urethroplasty measured one year post-operatively. Straddle injury (and perineal trauma) are a common aetiology in papers published about tEPA; however, separate data on the outcomes for this specific aetiology is usually lacking. 6.3.2.1.1.1.2.Complications Nilsen et al., conducted an RCT comparing tEPA with FGU for short (< 2 cm) bulbar strictures [315]. Compared to FGU, penile complications were more frequent with tEPA. After three months, worse ejaculation (26%), reduced glans filling (26%), penile shortening (16%) and penile chordee (10%) were significantly more reported with tEPA. After 12 months, reduced glans filling (19%) and penile shortening (26%) remained significantly more reported with tEPA. A scrotoperineal hematoma was significantly more frequent with tEPA compared to FGU (resp. 24 versus 4%). Despite these complications IIEF-5 was not significantly different between both groups at three and twelve months. These latter complications (as well as ED) might be attributed to complete transection of the corpus spongiosum at the level of the stricture, thereby disrupting the antegrade blood flow of the urethra and corpus spongiosum. To spare this, the non-transecting EPA (ntEPA) has been described [324] and later modified [325]. 6.3.2.1.1.2. Non-transecting excision and primary anastomosis 6.3.2.1.1.2.1.Patency rates Except for straddle injuries that are usually associated with complete obliteration of the lumen and full thickness scarring of the corpus spongiosum [319,326], ntEPA is a good alternative for short bulbar strictures of all other aetiologies. With median follow-ups ranging between 17.6 and 37.1 months, the patency rates reported are 93.2-99%; with the lack of further intervention as success criteria [322,327,328]. Even with the anatomic criteria (16 Fr cystoscopy passage) the success rate achieved was 97.9% at twelve months [319] (see supplementary Table S6.7). Two comparative analyses evaluated tEPA vs. ntEPA. Waterloos et al., reported patency rates of 88.4% and 93.2%, respectively, for tEPA and ntEPA (p=0.33) but with significantly longer follow-up for tEPA (118 vs. 32 months, p < 0.001). Of patients scheduled for ntEPA, 11.1% were converted to tEPA, highlighting that ntEPA is not always possible. Chapman et al., using anatomic success criteria (16 Fr cystoscope passage), reported patency in 93.8% of tEPA vs. 97.9% of ntEPA. Follow-up was also significantly shorter at 74.1 (SD: 45.4) months for tEPA vs. 37.1 (SD: 20.5) months for ntEPA (p < 0.001) [319]. 6.3.2.1.1.2.2.Complications When erectile function after urethroplasty was assessed (at six months), ntEPA had significantly lower ED rates (a decrease of > 5 points on the sexual health inventory for men [SHIM] scale) compared to tEPA (4.3 vs. 14.3%, respectively) [319]. Urethral transection performed during tEPA was the only factor associated with sexual dysfunction in a multivariate analysis [319]. Other series reported ED lasting for more than six months in 2-6% of cases after ntEPA [322,328,329]. Grade > 2 Clavian-Dindo complications were 3.6-8.1% vs. 4.3-6.8%, respectively, for tEPA and ntEPA, without reaching statistical significance [319,327]. To date, no trials comparing ntEPA with FGU have been published to report on comparative patency outcomes and complications. 6.3.2.1.2. Free graft urethroplasty Despite the very high patency rates of EPA, FGU has been performed for short bulbar strictures as well. This is mainly driven by reports of ED after EPA. A meta-analysis of ten papers [340] comparing tEPA with BMG FGU for short strictures, found that tEPA is better than BMG FGU in terms of patency rates (91.5% vs. 70%), whilst BMG FGU has less erectile complications (9% vs. 25%). However, the methodology of this meta-analysis must be disputed as it was performed on cohort studies without risk of bias assessment and without further specification of timing of assessment of ED. On the other hand an RCT comparing tEPA with BMG FGU, found no significantly different patency rates for EPA compared to BMG FGU (88% versus 87% respectively) and no significant differences in erectile function for tEPA compared to BMG FGU [315]. As mentioned earlier, penile complications were more frequent with EPA. Dogra et al., [283] looked prospectively at sexual function in 87 patients after different urethroplasties (EPA, penile/bulbar substitution) and found a 20% reduction in sexual function in all groups, which resolved after six months. Details on where to place the graft during FGU are discussed below.
