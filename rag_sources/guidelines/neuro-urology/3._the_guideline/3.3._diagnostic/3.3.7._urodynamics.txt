general patients. technical source artefacts must critically considered. essential maintain quality urodynamic recording interpretation . session repeat urodynamic investigations crucial clinical decision making, since repeat measurements may yield completely different results . patients risk ad, blood pressure (bp) heartrate monitoring urodynamic study invasive procedures mandatory . rectal ampulla empty stool start investigation. urodynamic findings must reported detail performed, according ics technical recommendations standards . patients sci, first urodynamic investigation take place

uroflowmetry assessment residual urine: recommended prior planning invasive urodynamics patients able void usual position. reliable information, repeated least two three times . possible pathological findings include low flow rate, low voided volume, intermittent flow, hesitancy pvr. filling cystometry: test method quantifying patient’s filling function. status lut function must documented filling phase. however, technique limited use solitary procedure. much effective combined bladder pressure measurement micturition even effective video-urodynamics. bladder empty start filling. physiological filling rate used body-warm saline. possible pathological findings include neurogenic detrusor overactivity (ndo), low bladder compliance, abnormal bladder sensations, low cystometric capacity urinary incontinence. detrusor leak point pressure : appears use diagnostic tool. positive findings reported , sensitivity low estimate risk uut secondary bladder damage . pressure flow study (or voiding cystometry): reflects coordination detrusor urethra pelvic floor voiding phase. even effective combined filling cystometry video-urodynamics. possible pathological findings include detrusor underactivity, acontractility, bladder outlet obstruction (boo), dsd, high urethral resistance, residual urine. types obstruction caused neuro-urological disorders due dsd , non-relaxing urethra, and/or non-relaxing bladder neck . pressure-flow analysis mainly assesses amount mechanical obstruction caused urethra’s inherent mechanical anatomical properties. electromyography (emg): reflects activity external urethral sphincter, peri-urethral striated musculature, anal sphincter, striated pelvic floor muscles. correct interpretation may difficult due artefacts introduced equipment. urodynamic setting, emg useful gross indication patient’s ability control pelvic floor. possible pathological findings include inadequate recruitment upon specific stimuli (e.g. bladder filling, involuntary detrusor contractions, onset voiding, coughing, valsalva manoeuvre) suggesting diagnosis dsd . urethral pressure measurement: limited role neuro-urological disorders. consensus parameters indicating pathological findings . video-urodynamics: combination filling cystometry pressure flow studies imaging. optimum procedure urodynamic investigation neuro-urological disorders . possible pathological findings include described filling cystometry pressure flow study sections, morphological pathology lut reflux uut . ambulatory urodynamics: functional investigation urinary tract, predominantly uses natural filling urinary tract reproduce patient’s normal activity. although type study might considered conventional urodynamics reproduce patient’s symptoms, role neuro-urological patient still needs determined . triggered tests urodynamics: lower urinary tract function provoked coughing, triggered voiding, anal stretch. fast-filling cystometry cooled saline (the ‘ice water test’) initially described discriminate upper lower motor neuron lesions . patients upper motor neuron lesions develop detrusor contraction detrusor intact, patients lower motor neuron lesions not. however, test seem fully discriminative since also non neurological lower motor sci shown positive test . previously, positive bethanechol test (detrusor contraction > 25 cm h2o) thought indicate
