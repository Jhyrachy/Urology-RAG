5.2.6. plant extracts – phytotherapy. potential mechanism action: herbal drug preparations made roots, seeds, pollen, bark, fruits. single plant preparations (mono-preparations) preparations combining two plants one pill (combination preparations) . possible relevant compounds include phytosterols, ss-sitosterol, fatty acids, lectins . vitro, plant extracts anti-inflammatory, anti-androgenic oestrogenic effects; decrease sexual hormone binding globulin; inhibit aromatase, lipoxygenase, growth factor-stimulated proliferation prostatic cells, α-adrenoceptors, 5 α-reductase, muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, dihydropyridine receptors vanilloid receptors; neutralise free radicals . vivo effects compounds uncertain, precise mechanisms plant extracts remain unclear. efficacy: extracts plant produced different companies necessarily biological clinical effects; therefore, effects one brand cannot extrapolated others . addition, batches producer may contain different concentrations active ingredients . review recent extraction techniques impact composition/biological activity available serenoa repens based products showed results different clinical trials must compared strictly according validated extraction technique and/or content active compounds , pharmacokinetic properties different preparations vary significantly. heterogeneity limited regulatory framework characterise current status phytotherapeutic agents. european medicines agency (ema) developed committee herbal medicinal products (hmpc). european union (eu) herbal monographs contain hmpc’s scientific opinion safety efficacy data herbal substances preparations intended medicinal use. hmpc evaluates available information, including non-clinical clinical data, whilst also documenting long-standing use experience eu. european union monographs divided two sections: a) well established use (marketing authorisation): active ingredient medicine used ten years efficacy safety well established (including review relevant literature); b) traditional use (simplified registration): herbal medicinal products fulfil requirements marketing authorisation, sufficient safety data plausible efficacy basis long-standing use experience. hpmc periodically invites interested parties submit scientific data committee consider periodic review monographs. table 1 lists available eu monographs herbal medicinal products current calls update. table 1: european union monographs herbal medicinal products herbal substancehmpc evaluationtherapeutic indication hmpcdate monographserenoa repens, fructus (saw palmetto, fruit)extraction solvent: hexane well established usesymptomatic treatment bph14/01/2016 addendum 1/9/21**serenoa repens, fructus (saw palmetto, fruit)extraction solvent: ethanol traditional useluts related bph*14/01/2016 addendum 1/9/21**cucurbita pepo l, semen (pumpkin seed)preparation defined monograph traditional useluts related bph related oab*25/03/2013call ended 30/4/21prunus africana (hook f.) kalkm., cortex (pygeum africanum bark)preparation defined monograph traditional useluts related bph*01/09/2017no call updateurtica dioica l., urtica urens l., hybrids mixtures, radixpreparation defined monograph traditional useluts related bph*05/11/2012call ended 30/6/21epilobium angustifolium l. and/or epilobium parviflorum schreb., herba (willow herb)preparation defined monograph traditional useluts related bph*13/01/2016no call update * serious conditions excluded medical doctor.** addendum concluded revision needed. panel interpretation: hexane extracted serenoa repens (hesr) recommended well-established use hmpc. based detailed scoping search covering timeframe search cut-off date eu monograph may 2021 conducted hesr. large meta-analysis 30 rcts 5,222 men follow-up ranging four 60 weeks, demonstrated benefit treatment s. repens comparison placebo relief luts . concluded s. repens superior placebo, finasteride, tamsulosin regard ipss improvement, qmax, prostate size reduction;
