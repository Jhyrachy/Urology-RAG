6.7.15. Guidelines for supportive care of castrate-resistant disease. These recommendations are in addition to appropriate systemic therapy. RecommendationsStrength ratingOffer bone protective agents to patients with metastatic prostate cancer and skeletal metastases to prevent osseous complications.StrongMonitor serum calcium and offer calcium and vitamin D supplementation when prescribing either denosumab or bisphosphonates.StrongTreat painful bone metastases early on with palliative measures such as intensity-modulated radiation therapy/volumetric arc radiation therapy plus image-guided radiation therapy and adequate use of analgesics.StrongIn patients with spinal cord compression start immediate high-dose corticosteroids and assess for spinal surgery followed by irradiation. Offer radiation therapy alone if surgery is not appropriate.Strong Figure 6.4: Treatment non-metastasized (M0) – asymptomatic disease * Rule of thumb: Life expectancy ten years.** Recommendation based on clinical staging using digital rectal examination, not imaging.*** Recommendation based on staging using combination of bone scan and CT.**** See text, dependent on GG and (biopsy) volume. 1EBRT: IMRT/VMAT + IGRT of the prostate. █ (light green) = weak recommendation.
