6.3.1.2. Single-stage augmentation urethroplasty. Single-stage urethroplasty offers the option for reconstruction of the stricture without the need for multiple operations, the associated peri-procedural risks, and the cosmetic and functional implications that by definition follow the first part of staged urethroplasties [267-269]. There is some evidence to suggest a considerable number of patients (50% or more in some studies) who were offered first stage urethroplasty never returned for the second stage because they were either satisfied with their functional status after the first stage (this particularly applied to older men or patients with multiple failed procedures in the past) or they were disappointed with the need for another operation [267,268]. In the SR of Mangera et al., overall patency rate for all types of single-staged graft urethroplasties is 75.7% with an average follow-up of 32.8 months [264]. The patency rate for different one-stage techniques in particular are: dorsal OMG (n=320): 63-100% [265,266,259,270-276];ventral OMG (n=54): 55-92.6% [265,277,278];double (dorsal + ventral) onlay with penile/scrotal skin graft /OMG (n=14/8/4): 88.5% [272];dorsal penile skin graft (n=44): 62-78% [272,273];penile skin flap (n=367): 67-100% [265,266,272-274,279]. No high-level evidence exists to state that one technique is superior to another, but it seems that the dorsal graft location is more commonly used compared to the ventral one. Mangera et al., reported that the patency rate was better with OMG compared to other grafts (mainly penile skin) [264]. Jiang et al., showed that combined (dorsal + ventral) BMG onlay had significantly better stricture-free rates for penoscrotal strictures (patency rate 88.9% vs. 60.9% with single-onlay approach); however, follow-up was significantly shorter in the double-onlay group [280]. Few studies have reported dedicated results on sexual function parameters that do not appear to be significantly impaired post-operatively [258,281]. A critical factor with respect to single-staged procedures is the careful selection of patients, as men with long and complex strictures might not be good candidates for single-stage reconstruction and attempts to offer single-staged operations in these patients might lead to higher recurrence rates. Sometimes, this selection can only be done based on intra-operative findings. Therefore, any scheduled single-staged procedure might be converted into a staged one [267,282]. Palminteri et al., highlighted the fact that single-stage augmentation urethroplasties in men with LS-related strictures enlarge rather than remove the diseased segment of the urethra; therefore, there is always a risk of recurrence in the future [283]. The role of previous interventions (especially multiple urethrotomies or history of previous urethroplasties) remains unclear as several studies on single-staged operations do not provide information on previous procedures, or excluded patients with operations in the past [274,281]. Although favourable outcomes in patients with previous history of urethrotomies/urethroplasties were reported by Barbagli and Kulkarni, in the study by Pfalzgraf et al., all recurrences post-previous urethroplasty took place in the single-stage group while Ekerhult et al., identified prior history of urethral operations as a risk factor for recurrence in the group of single-stage procedures [255,258,259,272]. In addition to previous urethral surgery, high BMI has also been identified as a poor prognostic factor after single-stage penile urethroplasty [255].
