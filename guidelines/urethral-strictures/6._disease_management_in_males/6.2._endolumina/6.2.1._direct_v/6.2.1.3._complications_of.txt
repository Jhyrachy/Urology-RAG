6.2.1.3. Complications of direct vision internal urethrotomy. 6.2.1.3.1. Complications of “cold knife” direct vision internal urethrotomy An overall complication rate of 6.5% was reported in a SR of Jin et al., based on twelve articles including 1,940 patients [211] (Table 6.3). Notably, erectile dysfunction (ED) was reported in 5.3% of cases in this review [211]. In addition, Graversen et al., reported ED in eleven out of 104 (10.6%) patients [218]. This risk appears higher in strictures located in the penile urethra and, in addition to the poor patency rates, the use of DVIU in the penile urethra must be discouraged [218,219]. 6.2.1.3.2. Complications of “hot knife” direct vision internal urethrotomy The SR of Jin et al., reported a total complication rate of 11.8% (39/330) [211] (Table 6.3). 6.2.1.3.3. Complications of “cold knife” vs. “hot knife” direct vision internal urethrotomy In a SR of RCTs comparing “cold knife” DVIU vs. laser DVIU, only 1/4 series reported complications [210]. In the laser group, an 8.9% complication rate was found due to contrast extravasation to the perineum and stricture recurrence. For the “cold knife” DVIU, a 15.5% complication rate was reported related to bleeding [210]. Two later RCT’s reported similar rates of urinary extravasation [212,213] and urinary incontinence (UI) [212] with both techniques. The SR of retrospective case series of Jin et al., found no significant differences in the incidence rates of UI, urinary extravasation and UTI between laser and “cold knife” DVIU [211]. However, urinary retention and haematuria were more frequent with laser compared to “cold knife” DVIU [211]. Conversely, In the series of Yenice et al., haematuria was only reported after “cold knife” DVIU but not after laser DVIU (p=0.6) [213] (Table 6.3).

Complications of direct vision internal urethrotomy vs. dilatation A Cochrane review found no significant differences for overall intra-operative complications (single dilatation vs. DVIU respectively 14% vs. 11%; RR: 0.75; 95 CI: 0.36-1.55) nor for individual complications (difficulty urinating, haematuria, false passage, pain, knotting/breaking/bending filiform leader) [196,220]. The low rate of false passage for both DVIU and dilatation (respectively 0.96 and 0.94%) might be explained by the systematic use of a filiform leader in both groups which was inserted endoscopically in the dilatation group followed by coaxial dilatators [196,220]. A small retrospective study comparing balloon dilatation (n=31) with DVIU (n=25) showed less urethral bleeding (6.5 vs. 32%; p=0.017) and UTI (3.2 vs. 24%; p=0.037) with balloon dilatation [221]. Apart from acute peri-operative complications described above, the stricture length and number of strictures were reported to increase after DVIU. Other authors mention that repeat urethral manipulations (DVIU and/or dilatation) can increase stricture complexity and delays time to urethroplasty [222]. 6.2.1.3.5. Complications of “cold knife” direct vision internal urethrotomy vs. urethroplasty The OPEN-trial reported adverse events of any type in 61% and 26.1% after urethroplasty (all types) and DVIU respectively [205]. In the urethroplasty group, mouth pain (related to oral mucosa graft [OMG] harvesting) and wound infection was noted as complication in respectively 14.6% and 4.9% of cases. Erectile dysfunction was 4.9% and 2.6% after urethroplasty and DVIU, respectively. Serious adverse events were reported in 8.5% and 8.7% after urethroplasty and DVIU respectively [205]. Summary of evidenceLEDirect vision internal urethrotomy performs poorly in penile strictures. Direct vision internal urethrotomy at the penile urethra might provoke venous leakage from the corpora cavernosa with subsequent risk of erectile dysfunction.1bIncreased stricture length is associated with higher risk of failure of direct vision internal urethrotomy (DVIU).1bIn selected patients with a primary, single, short (< 2 cm) and non-obliterative bulbar stricture, afive-year stricture-free rate of up to 77% can be expected.3Direct vision internal urethrotomy has a stricture-free rate of 51% if performed for a short, veil-like recurrent stricture after prior bulbar urethroplasty.3There is conflicting evidence that “hot knife” (laser, plasmakinetic) DVIU would be superior compared to “cold knife” DVIU after more than one year of follow-up.1a RecommendationsStrength ratingDo not use direct vision internal urethrotomy (DVIU) for penile strictures.StrongDo not use DVIU/dilatation as solitary treatment for long (> 2 cm) segment strictures.StrongPerform DVIU/dilatation for a primary, single, short (< 2 cm) and non-obliterative stricture at the bulbar urethra.WeakPerform DVIU/dilatation for a short, veil-like recurrent stricture after prior bulbar urethroplasty.WeakUse either “hot” or “cold knife” techniques to perform DVIU depending on operator experience and resources.Weak
