5.14. Pathology report. Pathological investigation of the specimen(s) obtained by TURB and biopsies is an essential step in the decision-making process for BC [218]. Close co-operation between urologists and pathologists is required. Clinical information and high quality of resected and submitted tissue is essential for correct pathological assessment. To obtain all relevant information, the specimen collection, handling and evaluation, should respect the recommendations provided below (see Section 5.14) [219]. In difficult cases, an additional review by an experienced genitourinary pathologist can be considered.
