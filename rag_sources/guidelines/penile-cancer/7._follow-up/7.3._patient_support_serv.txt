7.3. patient support services. surveillance assessing recurrent disease men may require frequent appointments suggested above, different members multi-disciplinary team deliver patient support services address qol challenges. fact, latter starts first pre-operative consultation, needs assessment identify areas individually challenging patient, physical, psychological, emotional, social financial. many men penile cancer reflect whilst knowledge potential functional psychological impacts treatment would stopped proceeding it, wish better understanding embarking surgery. pre-habilitation programmes also help this. recently qualitative study highlighted men penile cancer would appreciate focus following themes: “early signs seeking help”, “disclosure personal cancer” “urological (dys)function” . unfortunately, men survive penile cancer present with, recur with, advanced disease, extremely challenging symptoms manage, including pain, odour discharge. addition medical treatments outlined parts guidelines, early involvement palliative care services symptom control make huge difference patients. 7.3.1. psychological support access psychological support, counselling psychosexual therapy critical components holistic multi-disciplinary survivorship service. men often think “why me?” need help process thoughts try adjust changing situation. areas discussion might include identity self-esteem (lifestyle role adjustments), perceived burden, illness beliefs perceptions, levels social support, relationship quality intimacy, body self-image concerns around mortality. despite significant psychological challenges, rate suicide, based seer database (1973–2013) amongst lowest urological malignancies; 13 6,155 men . 7.3.2. quality life little data qol treatment penile cancer. particular, heterogeneity psychometric tools used assess qol outcomes research needed develop disease-specific proms penile cancer. validated questionnaires used none validated men penile cancer. tools used include lymqol (lymphoedema) , iief (erectile dysfunction) , sf-36 , european organization research treatment cancer [eortc] qlq-c30 , quality life questionnaire-penile cancer-rostock (hro-pe29) , hospital anxiety depression scale , eq-5d (euro qol tool), bigelow’s questionnaire , male genital self-image scale mgsis-5 groin lower limb lymphoedema questionnaire g3l-20 . surprisingly, published studies discussions patient groups demonstrate penile cancer treatments significant impact overall qol, physical psychological. however, discrepancy literature whether partial penectomy impacts qol penile-preserving surgical techniques, discussed below. erectile dysfunction, reduced frequency sexual intercourse reduced satisfaction intercourse reported studies . urinary spraying another potential significant consequence penile cancer surgery. significant anxiety (31%) depression (6%) also reported . german study reported 76 patients following primary penile surgery. reported global qol score well national average age-standardised german patients, voiding, sexuality, body image, lymphoedema reported areas concern . dutch study, 90 patients returned questionnaires (a return rate 62%) orgasm, appearance concerns, life interference urinary function significantly poorer following partial penectomy compared penile-preserving approach. study, lnd significant impact life interference. interestingly, compared age gender matched normative sample general population patients reported better outcomes sf-36 physical domain bodily pain sub scale . recent sr reported post-treatment qol 10 studies involving 346 men [157,176,315,321,323-328]. two studies evaluated qol primary endpoint compared outcomes among various treatment modalities . one studies used eortc qlq c-30 reported qol men penile cancer management different treatment modalities. observed treatment related overall wellbeing social contact activity. however, half individuals psychological symptoms follow-up . contrast, retrospective study men underwent penile-preserving surgery reported significant impact surgery every domain eortc qlq-c30 questionnaire . another study used bigelow’s questionnaire compared post-operative qol score two weeks surgery . reported scores relating unpleasant feeling, sexual pleasure familial/partner relations improved significantly (p < 0.01) whereas domains relating friend relationships professional quality unchanged. two non-randomised comparative studies used eortc qlq-c30 assess qol penile preserving surgery

differences penile-preserving surgery partial penectomy functional scale, symptom scale global health status . comparison glans resurfacing, glansectomy partial penectomy using eq-5d tool showed difference groups comparable health status scores 82.5, 85.0 87.5 respectively . another non-randomised comparative study also compared penile-preserving surgery partial penectomy reported difference qol using sf-36 scores . underwent amputative surgery significantly appearance concerns (p = 0.008) reported life interference (p = 0.032) depending degree disfigurement caused procedure. 7.3.3. urinary function urinary function important topic discuss men penile cancer treatment. already experiencing difficulty voiding due tumour causing urethral obstruction many report sit pass urine due spraying caused tumour. result, report improved function following surgery, often terms flow spraying needing sit void use funnel/bottle debilitating many men. urinary function objectively assessed studies. two case series reported improvement post-operative urinary function high satisfaction penile surgery . two non-randomised comparative studies reported difference urination penile-preserving surgery amputation. one demonstrated similar maximum flow rates following surgery (19.5 ml/s vs. 20.8 ml/s) reported urinary function comparable across study groups (glans resurfacing, glansectomy partial penectomy) using iciq-mluts score . however, different study found urine spraying common partial penectomy compared penile-preserving surgery (83% vs. 43%) . two case series reported significant changes urinary function following brachytherapy . single trial moh’s micrographic surgery, reported post-treatment change (66% response rate) . 7.3.4. sexual function sexual erectile function penile cancer varies studies treatments. generally, penile-preserving surgery preserves erectile function, although glans sensation orgasm affected. overall, partial penectomy associated poorer sexual outcomes. recent sr reported sexual erectile function 27 studies involve 991 men. 5- 15-question international index erectile function (iief) scores used studies. tools used erectile dysfunction inventory treatment satisfaction score (edits), index male genitalia image (im-gi), life satisfaction sexual life, self-esteem relationship (sear) combination tools assess overall sexual function . important acknowledge studies assessed baseline function therefore able report difference pre- post-treatment. studies reported post-treatment scores mean difference retrospectively completed pre-treatment scores. three non-randomised comparative studies one case series assessed impact penile-preserving surgery vs. amputation sexual function 202 men . two studies used 15-question iief questionnaire reported significant post-treatment changes orgasmic function domain favour penile-preserving surgery (p = 0.033 p = 0.033) domains remain comparable treatment arms . however, studies using 5-question iief score, difference identified treatments . older study compared impact penile-preserving surgery, amputative surgery radiotherapy sexual function reported treated amputation worst sexual outcome . three trials retrospectively compared penile-preserving surgery techniques using iief questionnaire . wide local excision superior glansectomy iief domains . impact primary closure versus preputial flap reconstruction glans-preserving surgery similar seen iief results 6 months rigid-scan parameters . partial glansectomy superior total glansectomy . cohort studies reported similar findings sexual function. five studies patients underwent penile-preserving surgery reconstruction reported 85–100% men able achieve erection maintain sexual function [158,335-338]. however, patients reported reduced glans sensitivity. following glans resurfacing penile cancer (n = 21) lichen sclerosis (n = 16) one study reported significant change urinary sexual function (using ipps iief questionnaires) glans sensitivity preserved 89.2% men . four studies 167 men partial penectomy reported significant changes 15-question iief score negative impact every domain . single trial reported 61.7% men partial penectomy report erectile dysfunction . however, study brazil, assessing 14 patients following partial penectomy, found 64% overall sexual function normal slightly decreased frequency sexual intercourse unchanged slightly decreased . sexual function brachytherapy assessed five cohort studies . among men sexually active treatment, 58.8–70.0% remain sexually active treatment . potency maintained 81.5–100% men . altered glans sensitivity reported 52.6% . three studies assessed sexual function laser treatment 46–56.5% men report impact treatment sexual life . single trial 46 men found 72% reported change erectile function, 22% reported decreased erectile function 6% reported improvement . one trial patients underwent moh’s micrographic surgery reported change sexual function treatment (57.5% response rate) . 7.3.5. lymphoedema lymphoedema significantly impacted functional domains one study patients 25 months following penile cancer nodal surgical treatment inguinal plnd much higher impact ilnd alone. patients inguinal plnd also much poorer mood score (38% vs. 0%) . due significant morbidity associated ilnd, many patients offered operation choose it. analysis us seer database reported 233 943 nonmetastatic penile cancer patients (24.7%) ilnd 1998 2015 . change time. similar proportion men, 606 2224 (27.2%) underwent surgery 2004 2014 recorded national cancer database . men assessed genital lower limb lymphoedema outpatient clinic appointment, advised good skin care, compression, exercise, massage, elevation resting mainstay treatment. following nodal surgery, ideally, would referred specialist lymphoedema services assessment management significant lymphoedema occurs. specialist lymphoedema services offer range made-to-measure compression garments multi-layer lymphoedema bandaging lower limb genital lymphoedema. latter compress scrotal lymphoedema also aim lift aid drainage. lower limb compression adjustable velcro garments also exist. good skin care critical prevent infection damage remaining lymphatic channels. prophylactic antibiotics used following episode cellulitis, penicillin v, erythromycin clindamycin recommended, except genital lymphoedema prophylactic trimethoprim used . manual lymphatic drainage form specialised massage techniques also helps alleviate lymphoedema encourages drainage. following penile cancer treatments commonly used stubborn mons lower abdominal swelling thickening scrotum penile shaft. whilst regular exercise may temporarily increase lymphoedema due effect gravity, overall beneficial effect lymphoedema reducing abdominal fat (fat drains via lymphatic channels too) using natural muscle pumps changes thoracic pressure help lymphatic drainage. strength training stretching exercises promote flexibility also important. debulking surgery scrotal reduction penile shaft skin grafting significantly improve issues related significant genital lymphoedema. limited evidence benefit surgical interventions limb liposuction followed compression lymphatico-venous anastomosis penile cancer although evidence exist extremity lymphoedema due various causes .
