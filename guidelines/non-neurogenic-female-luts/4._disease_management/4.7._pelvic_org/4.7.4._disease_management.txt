4.7.4. Disease management. Pelvic organ prolapse symptoms can be treated with PFMT, vaginal pessary, surgery, or a combination of these treatments. The scope of these guidelines is to focus on LUTS in women; therefore, only data on the effect of treatment of urinary symptoms are presented. 4.7.4.1. Conservative management of pelvic organ prolapse The 2013 NICE guidelines on Urinary Incontinence and POP in Women had an updated management section in 2019, including a full evidence review [66]. The overall conclusion with respect to conservative treatment for POP was that the evidence is of low quality. Thirteen RCTs were identified. Seven studies presented data on changes in urinary symptoms [637-643]. An additional search identified four RCTs that addressed the addition of PFMT to POP surgery [644-647], and one that compared combined PFMT/Pilates therapy with lifestyle advice by leaflet [648]. Five studies [638,640-642,648] compared PFMT to lifestyle advice/leaflet; one study [639] compared PFMT alone to PFMT with pessary; one study [643] compared PFMT to pessary therapy; and five studies compared surgery for POP with or without addition of PFMT [637,644-647]. 4.7.4.1.1. Pelvic floor muscle training versus lifestyle advice An RCT (n = 109) reported that, at six months’ follow-up, the ICIQ-UI-SF scores improved in favour of the PFMT group (2.40 points) compared with a control group receiving lifestyle advice only (0.2 points), but the mean baseline score in the PFMT group was higher than in the control group (7.4 vs. 5.9) [638]. Likewise, it has to be noted that the absolute ICIQ-UI-SF values at six months’ follow-up were not significantly different between PFMT (4.8) and controls (5.2). Two publications from one RCT reported on the three-, six- and twelve-month results of lifestyle advice only vs. lifestyle advice combined with group PFMT [640,641]. The Urogenital Distress Inventory-6 (UDI-6) and Urinary Impact Questionnaire-7 (UIQ-7) questionnaires were used to assess urinary symptoms. At three months’ follow-up, both groups (53 women in the lifestyle group and 56 in the lifestyle + PFMT cohort) reported significantly improved UDI-6 scores, while the lifestyle-only group also reported significantly greater improvement in the UIQ-7 score. Between-group comparison showed no differences in UDI-6 and UIQ-7 scores at six months. At twelve months’ follow-up, the majority of women had sought additional treatment (70% in the lifestyle-only group and 48% in the lifestyle/PFMT group). The number of patients remaining on the original therapy was too small to reach strong conclusions. One RCT reported on six- and twelve-months follow-up of 225 women with POP-Q stage 1–3 randomised to individualised PFMT and 222 women randomised to lifestyle leaflet information only (control) [642]. At six months, significantly more women in the control group reported UI, the need to strain to empty their bladder, and the feeling of incomplete emptying compared to the PFMT group. ICIQ-SF score was also significantly worse in the control group as compared to the PFMT group. However, at twelve months, there was no significant difference in these items between groups. It has to be noted that 50% in the control group received additional treatment within the twelve-month study period. Twenty-seven percent had additional PFMT, which may have had an effect on the twelve-month data. Another RCT reported on the 24-month follow-up of 414 women with stage 1–3 POP (207 assigned to PFMT/Pilates and 207 to lifestyle advice) [648]. Urinary symptoms were assessed with the ICIQ-UI-SF and a question about UI and difficulty emptying the bladder. At 24 months, the ICIQ-UI-SF score was significantly better in the intervention group (mean difference –0.83). However, the proportion of women reporting any UI did not differ between the groups, nor did the number of pads used weekly. One RCT compared PFMT alone to PFMT and pessary for symptomatic POP [639]. Urinary tract symptom changes were assessed using UDI-6 and UIQ at six and twelve months follow-up. At twelve months, there was no difference in the between-group comparison. With respect to the UIQ, women in the pessary/PFMT group showed a significant improvement from baseline, but the PFMT-only group did not. Women in the pessary/PFMT group reported significantly more frequent de novo SUI (48% vs. 22%), and more improvement of pre-existing voiding difficulty (62.5% vs. 35.5%). 4.7.4.1.2. Pelvic floor muscle training versus pessary only One RCT reported on the 24-month follow-up of 82 women with symptomatic POP randomised to pessary therapy and 80 women randomised to PFMT [649]. Both in the ITT and per protocol analyses, the UDI-6 score did not differ significantly between groups at 24 months of follow-up. 4.7.4.1.3. Surgery alone versus surgery with pelvic floor muscle training An assessor blinded RCT compared surgery for POP with or without additional pre-and postoperative PFMT. At twelve months after surgery, there were no significant differences between the groups on the change in scores of the UDI nor the IIQ scores [637]. Another RCT reported on the six-month follow-up of 57 women (28 surgery/29 surgery with PFMT). There was a significant improvement in the UDI-6 score for both groups, but not between groups [645]. Another RCT reported on the results of a 2x2 factorial design in which women were first randomised between two surgical techniques for POP and between additional PFMT (n = 188) or not (n = 186) [646]. The UDI was used to assess urinary symptoms up to 24 months. No significant differences were found between the addition of PFMT to surgery or not. Another study of the same population reported on SUI in particular [647]. No significant differences were found between women who had additional PFMT and those who had not. In 2020 an RCT reported on 40- and 90-days follow-up of 48 women randomised to supervised PFMT before and after surgery and 40 women having surgery only [644]. No significant differences in UDI-6 scores were identified at 40 and 90 days. ICI 2017 [18] concluded that there is level 1a evidence that PFMT reduces pelvic floor symptoms in women with POP, there is some evidence that it reduces POP specific symptoms like bulging. Some RCTs also show an improvement in POP stage with PFMT [650]. The NICE guidelines on the management of POP advocate considering supervised PFMT for > 16 weeks as initial treatment for symptomatic prolapse [66]. The use of pessary is also to be considered, alone or combined with PFMT. It is important to recognise that a benefit is expected on typical POP symptoms, like feeling or seeing a bulge out of the vagina, and not on LUTS, as the reported RCTs showed. From a urological perspective, initiating conservative treatment for asymptomatic POP in order to treat UI or bladder emptying problems is not supported by the data. 4.7.4.1.4. Pessary versus surgery alone A prospective cohort study showed that surgery in comparison with pessary treatment resulted in statistically significant more women reporting subjective improvement [651]. 4.7.4.1.5.

Pelvic organ prolapse surgery and overactive bladder Only a few studies have specifically addressed the effect of POP surgery on OAB symptoms. A SR of twelve studies, excluding women with SUI, evaluated OAB symptoms before and after surgery [623]. All but one study reported improvement of OAB symptoms. The same authors performed a prospective analysis of 505 women who had POP surgery with or without mesh [652]. Mean follow-up was 12.7 months. The incidence of bothersome urinary frequency reduced from 36.6% to 14.6%, with de novo symptoms occurring in 6.1%. Bothersome urgency symptoms reduced in 36.8% to 12.9% of women, with 5.0% developing de novo symptoms. Urge urinary incontinence symptoms reduced from 21.2% to 6.1% of women, with 5.3% developing de novo symptoms. One observational study evaluated frequency and urgency symptoms without consideration of bother in 87 women undergoing POP surgery and showed an improvement in frequency by 75%, and in urgency in 83% [653]. The effect of the POP-Q stage did not seem to influence the effect of surgery on OAB symptoms [652,653]. Another observational study (n = 43) evaluated the effect of posterior repair on OAB/DO and showed a 70–75% improvement rate in both parameters after surgery [654]. 4.7.4.3. Pelvic organ prolapse surgery and bladder outlet obstruction The criteria for BOO are based on urodynamic assessment. POP can be categorised as anatomical BOO, which is addressed in Sections 4.5.2.2 and 4.5.3.1. 4.7.4.4. Pelvic organ prolapse surgery and stress urinary incontinence The aim of this section is to address the options available to women who require surgery for POP and who have associated SUI (either before or after reduction of prolapse), and to assess the value of prophylactic anti-UI surgery in women with no evidence of SUI. A SR and meta-analysis of ten trials on prolapse surgery with or without an anti-incontinence procedure was reported in 2018 [655]. In addition, a Cochrane review including nineteen trials (n = 2,717) evaluating bladder function after surgery for POP presented analyses of women with POP and SUI, women with POP and occult SUI, and women with POP who were continent [656]. 4.7.4.4.1. Vaginal pelvic organ prolapse surgery in women with stress urinary incontinence Two trials addressed postoperative SUI in patients who had been diagnosed with SUI preoperatively and had vaginal POP surgery [657,658]. Two trials (n = 185 and 134) compared the use of MUS at initial POP surgery to POP surgery alone. The RR for postoperative SUI was 0.30 in favour of the combined POP surgery and MUS group. One of these two trials also compared the use of MUS at initial POP surgery and at three months if SUI persisted [657]. At twelve months’ follow-up, there was no difference between the groups regarding postoperative UI (RR 0.41); however, 44% of the women without initial MUS never required surgery and 29% were dry. 4.7.4.4.2. Abdominal pelvic organ prolapse surgery in women with stress urinary incontinence One RCT randomised 47 women with POP and SUI to an abdominal POP surgical procedure, e.g., sacro-colpopexy with or without Burch colposuspension. Additional SUI surgery did not improve postoperative SUI as compared to sacro-colpopexy alone (RR: 1.38) [659]. This finding remained consistent over five years’ follow-up [660]. Another RCT compared the addition of a MUS or Burch colposuspension to an abdominal sacro-colpopexy in 113 women with POP and SUI [661]. At two years’ follow-up, the RR for postoperative SUI was 0.54 in favour of the MUS group. 4.7.4.5. Vaginal pelvic organ prolapse surgery in continent women One RCT compared vaginal POP surgery alone with concomitant POP surgery and MUS in 220 women. Postoperative SUI occurred in 46/113 (40.7%) women who had POP surgery alone, compared to 30/107 (28.0%) who had additional MUS (RR: 0.69) [656]. 4.7.4.5.1. Abdominal pelvic organ prolapse surgery in continent women Two RCTs compared abdominal sacro-colpopexy with (n = 180) or without (n = 187) Burch colposuspension with an outcome favouring the addition of Burch colposuspension (RR for de novo SUI: 0.69) [659,662]. However, 34% of women in the prophylactic Burch colposuspension group developed de novo SUI (as compared to 49% in the control group). An RCT with medium-term follow-up (mean 39.5 months) showed that additional SUI surgery was needed by only 1/31 women (3%) in both groups [660,663]. 4.7.4.5.2. Vaginal pelvic organ prolapse surgery in women with prolapse and occult stress urinary incontinence Five RCTs including a total of 194 women who had vaginal POP repair alone and 174 women who had an additional MUS at the time of primary surgery were identified [632,664-667]. The RR of postoperative SUI was 0.38 in favour of the MUS group. 4.7.4.6. Adverse events associated with combined pelvic organ prolapse and stress urinary incontinence surgery Data from six RCTs on vaginal POP surgery with MUS were pooled to assess adverse events [632,657,658,665-667]. Urgency urinary incontinence was less frequent after combination surgery as compared to POP surgery alone (28% vs. 42%; RR: 0.7), but there was a tendency towards more voiding problems. Adverse events directly related to surgery occurred more often in the combination group (28% vs. 15%; RR: 1.8), as did serious adverse events such as bladder perforation, urethral injuries, and tape exposure (14% vs. 8%; RR: 1.7) [655]. In summary, it is difficult to generalise the results of trials using different procedures to treat both POP and UI. It seems that with a combined procedure, the rate of postoperative SUI is lower but voiding symptoms and complication rates are higher. Studies using MUS have shown more significant differences in UI outcomes with combined procedures than when other types of anti-UI procedure have been used. It must be taken into account that although more women are dry after combined surgery for POP with MUS, there are potential adverse events that should be balanced against potential benefits.
