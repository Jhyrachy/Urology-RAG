3.4. Disease Management. The treatment of urolithiasis is based on many parameters and is individualised for each patient. Parameters such as the size, number, location, and constitution of the stones are the cornerstones for deciding the treatment. In addition, the morphology, shape, volume, mobility, and hardness of the stone should be considered. Finally, the anatomy and compliance of the entire pelvic-calyceal system should be assessed for each patient. The design of therapeutic algorithms including all the above parameters is difficult mainly due to the great diversity of lithiasis disease per patient. Furthermore, there is a significant lack of comparative clinical studies to support development of algorithms using parameters other than stone size and composition.
