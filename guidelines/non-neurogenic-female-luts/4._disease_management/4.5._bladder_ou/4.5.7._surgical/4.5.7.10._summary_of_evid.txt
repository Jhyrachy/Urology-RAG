4.5.7.10. Summary of evidence and recommendations for surgical management of bladder outlet obstruction. Summary of evidenceLEIntrasphincteric injection of botulinum toxin results in the improvement of symptoms and urodynamic parameters.2Sacral nerve stimulation results in spontaneous voiding and a reduction in CISC rate in the majority of female BOO patients in idiopathic urinary retention.3More serious adverse events and surgical revisions were associated with the one-stage neuromodulator implantation procedure.3Repair of POP improved PVR and voiding symptoms.3Urethral dilatation in women with BOO results in significant improvement in OAB symptoms, but improvements in urodynamic parameters of voiding are inconsistent.1bProgrammed intermittent urethral dilatation results in better outcomes compared with on-demand dilatation.3Effects of urethral dilation are poorly sustained, requiring repeat intervention in the long term.3Internal urethrotomy followed by regular dilatations resulted in significant improvement in symptoms and urodynamic parameters in women with BOO.3Bladder neck incision in females with BOO results in improvements in symptoms and urodynamic parameters.3Complications of bladder neck incision are not common, but include VVF, SUI, and urethral stricture.3Urethroplasty using grafts or flaps in women with BOO due to urethral stricture have good success rates with significant improvements of symptoms, QoL scores and urodynamic parameters compared to baseline.3Urethroplasty results in better QoL and Qmax compared to urethral dilatation.2Long-term results showed significant stricture recurrence rate after urethroplasty.3Urethrolysis performed on women with voiding problems after anti-UI surgery resulted in improvements in symptoms, QoL and urodynamic parameters post-operatively.3Delayed urethrolysis was associated with persistent post-operative bladder symptoms.3Sling revision in women who presented with urinary retention or voiding problems and significant PVRs after sling surgery for UI resulted in improvements in symptoms and urodynamic parameters, resumption of voiding and reductions in PVRs.3Sling revision is associated with the risk of recurrent SUI.3 RecommendationsStrength ratingOffer intra-sphincteric injection of botulinum toxin to women with functional bladder outlet obstruction (BOO).WeakOffer sacral neuromodulation to women with functional BOO.WeakAdvise women with voiding symptoms associated with pelvic organ prolapse that symptoms may improve after surgery.WeakOffer urethral dilatation to women with urethral stenosis causing BOO but advise on the likely need for repeated intervention.WeakOffer internal urethrotomy with postoperative urethral self-dilatation to women with BOO due to urethral stricture disease but advise on its limited long-term improvement and the risk of postoperative urinary incontinence (UI).WeakDo not offer urethral dilatation or urethrotomy as a treatment for BOO to women who have previously undergone mid-urethral synthetic tape insertion due to the theoretical risk of causing urethral mesh extrusion.WeakInform women of limited long-term improvement (only in terms of post-void residual volume and quality of life) after internal urethrotomy.WeakOffer bladder neck incision to women with BOO secondary to primary bladder neck obstruction.WeakAdvise women who undergo bladder neck incision on the small risk of developing stress urinary incontinence (SUI), vesico-vaginal fistula or urethral stricture postoperatively.StrongOffer urethroplasty to women with BOO due to recurrent urethral stricture after failed primary treatment.WeakCaution women on the possible recurrence of strictures on long-term follow-up after urethroplasty.WeakOffer urethrolysis to women who have voiding difficulties after anti-UI surgery.WeakOffer sling revision (release, incision, partial excision, or excision) to women who develop urinary retention or significant voiding difficulty after tape surgery for UI.StrongCaution women about the risk for recurrent SUI and the need for a repeat/concurrent anti-UI surgery after sling revision.Strong
