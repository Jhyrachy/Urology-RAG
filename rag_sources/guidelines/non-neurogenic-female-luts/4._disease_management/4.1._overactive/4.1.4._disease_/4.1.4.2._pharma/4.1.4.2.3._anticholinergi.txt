4.1.4.2.3. anticholinergics beta-3 agonists: elderly patients cognition. systematic reviews included sections efficacy safety anticholinergics elderly patients older sr found inconclusive evidence impact anticholinergics cognition . two recent longitudinal cohort studies patients using anticholinergic drugs showed deterioration cognitive function, alteration central nervous system metabolism association brain atrophy . study periods short (four twelve weeks), long-term impact anticholinergic agents specifically approved oab treatment specific patient cohorts poorly understood [201-204]. oxybutynin: evidence oxybutynin ir may cause/worsen cognitive dysfunction adults . whilst short-term trials showed effect recent memory cognitive functions , prospective studies showed cumulative cognitive deterioration associated prolonged use (mean follow-up, 7.3 years) anticholinergic medication including oxybutynin . another prospective cohort study including 376 nursing home residents aged 65 older taking oxybutynin tolterodine showed decline activity daily living median follow-up 141 days, spite concomitant treatment cholinesterase inhibitors .solifenacin: one pooled analysis showed solifenacin increase cognitive impairment elderly patients. age-related differences pharmacokinetics solifenacin different age groups found, although frequent adverse events patients aged > 80 years observed. cognitive effect healthy elderly volunteers shown . sub-analysis large trial, solifenacin 5–10 mg improved symptoms qol people aged > 75 years responded tolterodine . patients mild cognitive impairment, aged > 65 years, solifenacin showed difference efficacy age groups lower incidence adverse effects compared oxybutynin ir .tolterodine: change efficacy adverse effects related age reported, although higher discontinuation rate found tolterodine placebo elderly patients . two rcts elderly patients found similar efficacy adverse effect profile younger patients [212-215]. post hoc analysis shown little effect cognition. one non-randomised comparison showed lower rates depression elderly participants treated tolterodine er compared oxybutynin ir . duration rcts short (twelve weeks).darifenacin: two rcts elderly population (one patients uui volunteers) concluded that, compared placebo, darifenacin effective risk cognitive change, measured memory scanning tests . another study darifenacin oxybutynin er elderly people concluded two agents similar efficacy, cognitive function often affected oxybutynin er arm .trospium chloride: trospium appear cross blood–brain barrier healthy individuals due molecular characteristics (quaternary amine structure hydrophilic properties). two studies healthy volunteers using electroencephalography showed effect trospium, tolterodine caused occasional changes oxybutynin caused consistent changes . evidence comparative efficacy adverse effect profiles trospium different age groups available. however, evidence trospium impair cognitive function alzheimer’s disease patients combined cholinesterase inhibitors six month period , non-cognitively impaired patients shorter periods (twelve weeks) effective compared placebo elderly .fesoterodine: pooled analyses rcts fesoterodine confirmed efficacy 8 mg 4 mg dose patients aged > 75 years . adherence lower patients aged > 75 years effects mental status reported . recent rct showed efficacy fesoterodine vulnerable elderly people differences cognitive function twelve weeks .mirabegron: analysis pooled data three rcts showed efficacy safety mirabegron elderly patients .
