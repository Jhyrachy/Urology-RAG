3.13.4.9. Continent and incontinent cutaneous urinary diversion. Incontinent urinary diversion should be considered in patients who are not willing or able to perform a CIC and who need urinary diversion because of upper tract deterioration or gain urinary continence due to social reasons. In children and adolescents, the colonic conduit has shown to have less complications compared to the ileal conduit [875-878]. Total bladder replacement is extremely rare in children and adolescents, but may be necessary in some adults due to secondary malignancies or complications with urinary diversions. Any type of major bladder and bladder outlet construction should be performed in centres with sufficient experience in the surgical technique, and with experienced healthcare personnel to carry out post-operative follow-up [822,879,880]. Algorithms can be used for management of these patients (Figures 8 and 9).
