6.4.6. Hormonal therapy for relapsing patients. The Panel conducted a SR including studies published from 2000 onwards [1024]. Conflicting results were found on the clinical effectiveness of HT after previous curative therapy of the primary tumour. Some studies reported a favourable effect of HT, including the only RCT addressing the research question of this review (86% vs. 79% advantage in OS in the early HT group) [1025]. Other studies did not find any differences between early vs. delayed, or no, HT. One study found an unfavourable effect of HT [1026]. This may be the result of selecting clinically unfavourable cases for (early) HT and more intensive diagnostic workup and follow-up in these patients. The studied population is highly heterogeneous regarding their tumour biology and therefore clinical course. Predictive factors for poor outcomes were short PSA-DT, high ISUP grade group, high PSA, increased age and comorbidities. In some studies, such as the Boorjian, et al., study [1027], high-risk patients, mainly defined by a high ISUP grade group and a short PSA-DT (most often less than six months) seem to benefit most from (early) HT, especially men with a long life expectancy. Non-steroidal anti-androgens have been claimed to be inferior compared to castration, but this difference was not seen in M0 patients [960]. One of the included RCTs suggested that intermittent HT is not inferior to continuous HT in terms of OS and CSS [1028]. A small advantage was found in some QoL domains but not overall QoL outcomes. An important limitation of this RCT is the lack of any stratifying criteria such as PSA-DT or initial risk factors. Based on the lack of definitive efficacy and the undoubtedly associated significant side effects, patients with recurrence after primary curative therapy should not receive standard HT since only a minority of them will progress to metastases or PCa-related death. The objective of HT should be to improve OS, postpone distant metastases, and improve QoL. Biochemical response to only HT holds no clinical benefit for a patient. For older patients and those with comorbidities the side effects of HT may even decrease life expectancy; in particular cardiovascular risk factors need to be considered [1029,1030]. Early HT should be reserved for those at the highest risk of disease progression defined mainly by a short PSA-DT at relapse(< 6–12 months) or a high initial ISUP grade group (> 2/3) and a long life expectancy. A three-arm randomised phase III trial (EMBARK) looked at patients with prostate cancer who had high-risk biochemical recurrence defined as a PSA-DT of ≤9 months and a PSA level of ≥2 ng/ml above the nadir after radiation therapy or ≥1 ng/ml after radical prostatectomy with or without postoperative radiation therapy [1031]. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1:1 to receive enzalutamide daily plus leuprolide every 12 weeks (combination group), placebo plus leuprolide (leuprolide-alone group), or enzalutamide monotherapy (monotherapy group). The primary end point was MFS, in the combination group as compared with the leuprolide- alone group. The MFS in the monotherapy group as compared with the leuprolide-alone group was a key secondary endpoint. A total of 1068 patients were randomised. After a median follow-up of 60.7 months, the five year - MFS was 87.3% (95% CI, 83.0 - 90.6) in the combination group, 71.4% (95% CI, 65.7 - 76.3) in the leuprolide-alone group, and 80.0% (95% CI, 75.0 - 84.1) in the monotherapy group. The combination of enzalutamide plus leuprolide was superior to leuprolide alone with regards to the MFS (HR 0.42; 95% CI, 0.30 - 0.61; P<0.001). Enzalutamide monotherapy also showed a superior MFS compared to leuprolide alone (HR 0.63; 95% CI, 0.46 - 0.87; P = 0.005). These results led to the FDA approval for enzalutamide alone or in combination with ADT for patients with high-risk biochemical recurrence in November 2023 [1032]. At the time of the MFS analysis, OS data were immature with 12% deaths in the overall population. Also, an intermittent treatment approach can be considered. Enzalutamide treatment can be suspended if PSA is undetectable (< 0.2 ng/mL) after 36 weeks of therapy. Treatment may be reinitiated when PSA has increased to ≥ 2.0 ng/mL for patients who had prior radical prostatectomy or ≥ 5.0 ng/mL for patients who had prior primary radiation therapy. There were no new safety signals. Of note, at a median follow-up of five years, the overall percentage of patients who had fractures was 14% [1033].
