9.1.4. Summary of evidence and recommendations for classification. Summary of evidenceLEMale genital malformations represent a rare clinical entity with an overall prevalence between 0.9% and 2.1%.3Obesity, lichen sclerosis and penile cancer treatment are risk factors for AABP.4Adult acquired buried penis (AABP) is commonly associated with erectile and voiding dysfunctions, difficulties in maintaining adequate genital hygiene and a poor quality of life.3Adult acquired buried penis condition can be staged upon both clinical presentation and the surgical procedure required according to available classification systems3Bladder exstrophy–epispadias complex (BEEC) is a rare clinical condition frequently associated with male genital malformations, particularly micropenis.2bPenile trauma and surgical amputation due to penile cancer are the most common acute causes of intrinsic penile shortening.3The most frequent aetiologies leading to a chronic intrinsic penile shortening are PD, treatments for prostate cancer (RP, radiation therapy and androgen-deprivation therapy) and radical cystectomy.2bBody dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is a clinical entity associated with a significant distress or impairment in important areas of the individual’s life.2bPenile Dysmorphic Disorder (PDD) can be used as a shorthand concept to describe BDD patients mainly focused on penile size/shape.4Body dysmorphic disorder /PDD can be revealed in patients requiring cosmetic surgery.3 RecommendationsStrength ratingA detailed genital examination should be considered in all men and particularly in men with BMI > 30, lichen sclerosis or penile cancer history and complaints of urinary/sexual difficulties or poor cosmesis to exclude the presence of an adult acquired buried penis (AABP) condition.StrongUse classification systems to classify AABP clinical presentation and surgical management.WeakInquire on the presence of body dysmorphic disorder/penile dysmorphic disorder in patients with normal-sized penis complaining of short penile size.Strong
