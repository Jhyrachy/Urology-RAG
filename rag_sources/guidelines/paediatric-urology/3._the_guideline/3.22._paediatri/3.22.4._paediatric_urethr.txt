therefore, immediate urethroplasty performed dedicated urethral surgeon . posterior urethral injury unlike anterior urethral injuries immediate realignment, children posterior urethral injuries, staged approach delayed repair may appropriate. children, significantly less experience delayed repair, large paediatric series delayed repair 68 boys reporting succesfull voiding continence rate 90% . another study reported strictures erectile dysfunction 67% boys, although boys continent post-operatively . follow-up study fifteen patients underwent delayed urethroplasty blunt urethral trauma childhood reported high long-term success rates, low rate long-term urinary sexual dysfunction adulthood . revision surgery large study revision urethroplasty analysing revision urethroplasty following pelvic floor urethral injuries children adolescents demonstrated injuries appeared common developing world, complex findings longer gaps. patients support findings best managed delayed transperineal repair self-reported success 85% . hand, small prospective study demonstrated good results immediate primary endoscopic realignment patients posterior urethral bladder neck injuries . may serve alternative permitting endoscopic anatomy post-injury. large study exploring outcomes different urethroplasty techniques boys girls demonstrated paediatric pelvic floor urethral injuries addressed transperineal approach reasonable long-term outcomes (>80%), however 25% patient require endoscopic/open procedures follow-up. challenging cases salvage procedures utilizing vascular-based flaps urethral substitute yield good results, however numbers lost follow-up significant 40.6% . study eighteen boys undergoing urethroplasty strictures (traumatic/iatrogenic), post-void dribbling urgency main patient-reported outcome measures (proms) following surgery, universally high satisfaction rates. proms important consideration urologists performing procedures children, likely need continued long-term follow-up . previously experienced failed urethroplasty following pelvic-fracture associated urethral injuries, cases recurrent posterior urethral strictures < 3 cm length operated perineal urethroplasty reasonable success rates. complex long-segment (higher 3 cm) strictures require use ancillary procedures like trans-pubic urethroplasty, substitution urethroplasty mitrofanoff appendicovescostomy complication rates adolescents 33% . 3.22.4.3. recommendations diagnosis management paediatric trauma recommendationsstrength ratingassess urethra retrograde urethrogram case suspected urethral injury.strongperform rectal examination determine position prostate.strongmanage urethral injuries conservatively initially transurethral catheter placed.strongmanage posterior urethral injuries either:primary drainage suprapubic catheter alone delayed repairprimary re-alignment transurethral catheterweak
