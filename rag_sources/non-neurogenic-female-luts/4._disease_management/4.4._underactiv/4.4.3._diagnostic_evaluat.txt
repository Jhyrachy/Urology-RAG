isovolumetric detrusor pressure. bladder contractility index (bci) reduction pip index . population pip bci developed mainly consisted men. projected isovolumetric pressure 1, similar pip also estimates isovolumetric detrusor pressure, developed entirely female population via experimental method . third method quantifying bladder contraction strength involves stop tests. one study compared three types direct measurement isovolumetric pressure: (1) voluntary stop test, patient voluntarily interrupted flow; (2) mechanical stop test, flow interrupted balloon catheter; (3) continuous occlusion test, subject tried void blocked outlet. latter best reliability best detected drug-induced changes, though results mechanical stop tests similar . parameters discussed give information strength detrusor contraction given void. necessarily reflect detrusor might potentially achieve optimum conditions . also, give information voiding duration. parameters available. finally, abnormally low bladder contraction strength necessarily imply insufficient bladder contraction strength achieve optimal voiding. table 4 summarises different parameters measure detrusor contraction female patients. table 4: used parameters measure detrusor contraction female patients parameterbasispopulationvalueswatt’s factor hill equation muscle contraction spherical organ, fixed constants obtained experimental clinical studieseight asymptomatic female volunteers aged 28–45 years (median 34 years)ideal voiding (bell-shaped flow curves): wfmax 11-24 w/m2non-ideal voiding: wfmax5−10 w/m2normally wfmax > 7 w/m2 (expert opinion, unspecified population) projected isovolumetric pressure (cm h2o) bci, using pip index bladder output relation, simplified straight line fixed slope of5 cm h2o/ml/s (formula: pdetqmax + 5xqmax)unspecified population, mainly men bpoclassification based expert opinion:> 150: strong contraction100–150: normal contraction50–100: weak contraction< 50: weak contractionprojected isovolumetric pressure 1 (cm h2o) comparison qmax pdetqmax values stop test results(formula: pdetqmax + qmax)100 women uui aged 53–89 (mean 70) years5th-95th percentile: 29–78 cm h2omean: 49 cm h2omedian: 48 cm h2oproposed typical values: 30-75 cm h2ocontinuous occlusion test direct measurement isovolumetric voiding contraction70 women uui aged 53–89 (mean: 70) yearsmean ± sd: 48.7 ± 24.4 cm h2o bci = bladder contractility index;
