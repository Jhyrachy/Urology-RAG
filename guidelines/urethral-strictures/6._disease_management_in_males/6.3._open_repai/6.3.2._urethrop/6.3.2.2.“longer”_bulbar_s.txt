6.3.2.2.“Longer” bulbar strictures. 6.3.2.2.1. Free graft urethroplasty For strictures not amenable to EPA, FGU is the technique of choice and buccal mucosa is, at the moment, the most widely used graft. Other grafts (and flaps) are possible and discussed in the tissue transfer chapter. Patency rates of FGU of the bulbar urethra are 88-91% with twelve to 40 months follow-up [264,330]. There is a suggestion that patency rates deteriorate with time [331]. During bulbar urethroplasty, the bulbospongiosus muscle is usually separated at the midline which may cause damage to the muscle and perineal nerves. This might subsequently provoke post-void dribbling and ejaculation disorders. In order to reduce this, the muscle and nerve-sparing perineal approach has been introduced [332]. Although it is mostly used in graft urethroplasty, this approach is also possible for EPA [333]. Elkady et al., [329] randomised 50 patients between a muscle and nerve-sparing perineal approach vs. a classic perineal approach and found no difference in operative time (100 vs. 105 min), but significantly less dribbling (4% vs. 36%, p=0.01), and significantly less ejaculatory changes (8% vs. 40%, p=0.02) in the nerve and muscle-sparing group. Fredrick et al., [333] did the same in 50 patients in a multicentric study with bulbar urethroplasty but could not find a statistical difference regarding post-void dribbling and ejaculatory changes. Due to the limited and conflicting evidence, no recommendation can be made about the routine use of nerve and muscle-sparing modification during bulbar urethroplasty. See supplementary Table S6.8 for further information. 6.3.2.2.2. Augmented anastomotic repair Augmented anastomotic repair has been described for these strictures. It has been mainly performed in cases where the stricture was just too long (+/- 2-4 cm) for tension-free EPA [334]. It can also be performed for longer strictures with a shorter (nearly) obliterative segment [335]. In this case, only the most obliterative segment is excised, the urethral plate is anastomosed, and the urethra is further reconstructed with an onlay graft [335]. Patency rates after AAR vary between 91.1 - 91.9% with twelve to 28 months follow-up [334]. The use of this technique has been challenged by Redmond et al., who found a 4.8 higher risk of recurrence when AAR was used compared to (dorsal) free graft urethroplasty [336] (see supplementary Table S6.9). A non-transecting alternative has also been described to overcome the previously mentioned inconveniences related to spongiosal transection (augmented non-transecting anastomotic bulbar urethroplasty [ANTABU]). With this technique, Bugeja et al., [337] reported a 100% patency rate in sixteen patients after a median follow-up of thirteen months. One patient (6.7%) suffered permanent ED. Summary of evidenceLEFor strictures not amenable to EPA, FGU provides an 88-91% patency rate at short to mediumfollow-up1bAugmented anastomotic repair provides good (88-92%) patency rates for bulbar strictures with a nearly obliterative segment, despite deterioration with time.3 RecommendationsStrength ratingUse free graft urethroplasty for bulbar strictures not amendable to excision and primary anastomosis (EPA).StrongUse augmented anastomotic repair for bulbar strictures not amenable to EPA but with a short, nearly obliterative segment within the whole strictured segment.Weak 6.3.2.2.3. Location of the graft during urethroplasty for bulbar strictures The best location for graft positioning into the bulbar urethra remains to be determined. There are many techniques described with ventral, lateral, dorsolateral, or dorsal graft as an onlay or an inlay. Onlay means from the outside onto the urethra, inlay means from the inside after opening the urethra. Regarding the site of graft placement, the Panel has conducted a SR assessing the literature from 1996 onwards, including studies with at least 20 patients and a minimum of twelve months follow-up [7]. This yielded one RCT, four non-randomised comparative series and 36 case series comprising 3,683 patients. The RCT of Vasudeva et al., compared ventral (n=40) with dorsal (n=40) onlay BMG urethroplasty and reported a patency rate of 90 - 92.5%, respectively at twelve months follow-up (p=0.51) [330]. The non-randomised comparative studies could not identify any significant differences in patency rates for dorsal onlay vs. ventral onlay, dorsal inlay vs. ventral onlay or dorsal onlay vs. ventral onlay vs. dorsolateral onlay. Case series reported a patency rate of 62.1-98.3% for dorsal onlay, 74.3-94.4% for ventral onlay and 78.4-92% for dorsal inlay. There are no arguments to assume a higher risk of ED with one of the four techniques. Post-void-dribbling was reported in 0-28.1% with dorsal onlay and in 20-21% with ventral onlay. Other complications were also similar in incidence between techniques. Urethrocutaneous fistula and urethral diverticulum were only reported with the ventral onlay technique although this consisted of only two and one cases, respectively. Double ventral-dorsal onlay, proposed for high-grade/nearly obliterative strictures, yielded a patency rate of 90-91% after 22-33 months follow-up [146,338]. Summary of evidenceLELocation of the graft has no impact on patency rates.1b RecommendationStrength ratingUse dorsal, dorsal-lateral, or ventral approach according to surgical practice, expertise, and intra-operative findings.Strong
