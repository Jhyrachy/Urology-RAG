3.8. Conclusions. Neuro-urological disorders have a multifaceted pathology. They require an extensive and specific diagnosis before one can embark on an individualised therapy, which takes into account the medical and physical condition of the patient and the patient’s expectations about their future. The urologist can select from a wealth of therapeutic options, each with its own pros and cons. Notwithstanding the success of any therapy embarked upon, close surveillance is necessary for the patient’s entire life. These Guidelines offer you expert advice on how to define the patient’s neuro-urological symptoms as precisely as possible and how to select, together with the patient, the appropriate therapy. This last choice, as always, is governed by the golden rule: as effective as needed, as non-invasive as possible.
