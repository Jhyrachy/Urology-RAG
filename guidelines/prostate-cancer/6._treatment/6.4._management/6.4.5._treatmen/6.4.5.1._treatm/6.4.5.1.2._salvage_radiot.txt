6.4.5.1.2. Salvage radiotherapy combined with androgen deprivation therapy (cTxcN0, without PET/CT). Data from RTOG 9601 suggest both CSS and OS benefit when adding two years of bicalutamide (150 mg o.d.) to SRT [967]. According to GETUG-AFU 16 also 6-months treatment with a LHRH-analogue can significantly improve 10-year BCR, biochemical PFS and, modestly, MFS. However, SRT combined with either goserelin or placebo showed similar DSS and OS rates [968]. In addition, Pollack et al., reported on the results of a randomised 3-arm phase III trial (NRG Oncology/RTOG 0534 SPPORT) adding six months treatment with a LHRH-analogue to SRT of the prostate bed (PBRT) (group 2) compared with PBRT alone (group 1) or the former combination with PBRT-RT and pelvic LN RT (PLNRT) (group 3) [969]. The primary endpoint was freedom from progression (FFP) after five years. However, using the phoenix-definition of biochemical progression (nadir + 2 ng/mL used for definitive RT), and not the criterion of nadir + 0.2, as is used commonly (but without clear evidence) will have resulted in a later diagnosis of progression in the SPPORT trial. With a median follow-up of 8.2 years of the surviving patients FFP increased significant for group 3 (87.4%) compared with group 2 (81.3%) (p = 0.0027) and group 1 (70.9%) (p < 0.0001) The difference between group 2 and group 1 was also significant (p < 0.0001). Distant metastasis incidence rates were lowest in group 3 and were lower compared with group 1 (PBRT only, HR: 0.52) similar to the rate of PCa deaths (HR: 0.51). No significant difference was seen for OS. There was a significantly higher risk of both acute- and late side effects in group 3. Therefore, the role of additional PLNRT remains unclear and should be further proven in RCTs including PSMA PET-CT [970]. Table 6.4.5 provides an overview of these three RCTs. These RCTs support adding ADT to SRT. However, when interpreting these data it has to be kept in mind that RTOG 9601 used outdated radiation dosages (< 66 Gy) and technique. The question with respect to the patient risk profile, whether to offer combination treatment or not, and the optimal combination (LHRH or bicalutamide) remains, as yet, unsolved. The EAU BCR risk classification may offer guidance in this respect [898]. One of these RCTs reports improved OS (RTOG 96-01) and the other (GETUG-AFU 16) improved MFS but due to methodological discrepancies and also related to follow-up and risk, it is, as yet, not evident which patients should receive ADT, which type of ADT, and for how long. Men at high risk of further progression (e.g., with a PSA ≥ 0.7 ng/mL and GS ≥ 8) may benefit from SRT combined with two years of ADT; for those at lower risk (e.g., PSA < 0.7 ng/mL and GS = 8) SRT combined with six months of ADT may be sufficient. Men with a low-risk profile (PSA < 0.5 ng/mL and GS < 8) may receive SRT alone. In a sub-analysis of men with a PSA of 0.61 to 1.5 (n = 253) there was an OS benefit associated with antiandrogen assignment (HR: 0.61, 95% CI: 0.39–0.94) [971]. In those receiving early SRT (PSA 0.6 ng/mL, n = 389), there was no improvement in OS (HR: 1.16, 95% CI: 0.79–1.70), with increased other-cause mortality (sub-distribution HR: 1.94, 95% CI: 1.17–3.20, p = 0.01) and increased odds of late grades 3–5 cardiac and neurologic toxic side effects (OR: 3.57, 95% CI: 1.09–15.97, p = 0.05). These results suggest that pre-SRT PSA level may be a prognostic biomarker for outcomes of anti-androgen treatment with SRT. In patients receiving late SRT (PSA > 0.6 ng/mL), HT was associated with improved outcomes. In men receiving early SRT (PSA < 0.6 ng/mL), long-term anti-androgen treatment was not associated with improved OS [971]. A SR addressing the benefit from combining HT with SRT suggested risk stratification of patients based on the pre-SRT PSA (< 0.5, 0.6–1, > 1 ng/mL), margin status and ISUP grade as a framework to individualise treatment [972].
