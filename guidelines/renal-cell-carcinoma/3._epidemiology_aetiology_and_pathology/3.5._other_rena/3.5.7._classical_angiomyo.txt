3.5.7. Classical Angiomyolipoma. Classical angiomyolipoma (AML)/PEComa of the kidney is a benign mesenchymal tumour, which can occur sporadically or as part of tuberous sclerosis complex [60]. Overall prevalence is 0.44%, with 0.6% in female and 0.3% in male populations. Only 5% of these patients present with multiple AMLs [61]. Angiomyolipoma belongs to a family of so-called PEComas (perivascular epithelioid cell tumours), characterised by the proliferation of perivascular epithelioid cells. Some PEComas can behave aggressively and even metastasise, while classic AMLs are completely benign [25,48,62]. Ultrasound, CT, and MRI often lead to the diagnosis of AMLs due to the presence of adipose tissue; however, in fat-poor AML, diagnostic imaging cannot reliably identify these lesions. Percutaneous biopsy is rarely useful. Renal tumours that cannot be clearly identified as benign during the initial diagnostic work-up should be treated according to the recommendations provided for the treatment of RCC. In tuberous sclerosis, AML can be found in enlarged lymph nodes (LNs), which does not represent metastatic spread but a multicentric spread of AMLs. In rare cases, an extension of a non-malignant thrombus into the renal vein or inferior vena cava (IVC) can be found, associated with an angiotrophic-type growth of AML. Epithelioid AML, a very rare variant of AML, consists of at least 80% epithelioid cells and with mean age of onset of 50 years (range 30-80 years), without gender predilection [48,62]. Epithelioid AMLs are potentially malignant with a variable proportion of cases with aggressive behaviour [63]. Criteria to predict the biological behaviour in epithelioid AML were proposed by the WHO 2022 [22,23]. Angiomyolipoma, in general, has a slow and consistent growth rate, and minimal morbidity [64]. Subtypes of AML are oncocytic AML and AML with epithelial cysts [22]. In some cases, larger AMLs can cause local pain. The main complication of AMLs is spontaneous bleeding in the retroperitoneum or into the collecting system, which can be life threatening. Bleeding is caused by spontaneous rupture of the tumour. Little is known about the risk factors for bleeding, but it is believed to increase with tumour size and may be related to the angiogenic component of the tumour that includes irregular blood vessels [64]. The major risk factors for bleeding are tumour size, grade of the angiogenic component, and the presence of tuberous sclerosis. 3.5.7.1. Treatment of angiomyolipoma Active surveillance is the most appropriate option for most AMLs (48%). In a group of patients on AS, only 11% of AMLs showed growth, and spontaneous bleeding was reported in 2%, resulting in active treatment in 5% of patients [64] (LE: 3). The association between AML size and the risk of bleeding remains unclear and the traditionally used 4-cm cut-off should not per se trigger active treatment [64]. When surgery is indicated, NSS is the preferred option, if technically feasible. Main disadvantages of less invasive selective arterial embolisation (SAE) are more recurrences and a need for secondary treatment (0.85% for surgery vs. 31% for SAE). For thermal ablation only limited data are available, and this option is used less frequently [64]. Active treatment (SAE, surgery or ablation) should be instigated in case of persistent pain, ruptured AML (acute or repeated bleeding) or in case of a very large AML. Specific patient circumstances may influence the choice to offer active treatment, such as patients at high risk of abdominal trauma, females of childbearing age or patients in whom follow-up or access to emergency care may be inadequate. Selective arterial embolisation is an option in case of life-threatening AML bleeding. In patients diagnosed with tuberous sclerosis, size reduction of often bilateral AMLs can be induced by inhibiting the mTOR pathway using everolimus, as demonstrated in RCTs [65,66]. In a small phase II trial(n = 20), efficacy of everolimus was demonstrated in sporadic AML as well. A 25% or greater reduction in tumour volume at four and six months was demonstrated in 55.6% and 71.4% of patients, respectively. However, 20% of patients were withdrawn due to toxicities and 40% self-withdrew from the study due to side effects [67].
