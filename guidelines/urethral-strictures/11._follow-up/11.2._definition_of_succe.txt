11.2. Definition of success after urethroplasty surgery. The “traditional academic” definition of post-operative success after urethroplasty has been considered as “The lack of any post-operative intervention for restricture” [560]. This definition, despite being widely used [305,558] is problematic as it ignores asymptomatic or even symptomatic recurrences in patients not willing to undergo further surgeries [560]. There is some variation as to what is considered intervention with some groups accepting endoscopic treatments as success, while considering failure only as the requirement for a ReDo urethroplasty [306]. A more objective definition of success is the “anatomic success”, defined as “Normal urethral lumen during RUG or cystoscopy, regardless of patient symptoms”. Using this definition, stricture recurrence or anatomical failure is considered by some groups as urethral narrowing found to be endoscopically impassable – without force – with a 16 Fr flexible endoscope [145,561]. This definition is certainly stricter, with up to 35% of cystoscopic recurrences after bulbar urethroplasty remaining asymptomatic, and thus would have been considered as successful if a “lack of further intervention” definition was used [145]. Other groups consider cystoscopic recurrence as any stricture that is visible on post-operative cystoscopy, even the so-called “large calibre re-strictures” (> 17 Fr) [143]. Not all anatomic recurrent strictures would need further treatment [560]. It was suggested to intervene when the anatomic recurrence is associated with recurrence of symptoms, stricture-related high post-void residuals or a stricture calibre of < 14 Fr – even if these are asymptomatic [560]. Over the last ten years, the evaluation of urethral surgery outcomes has shifted towards a “patient-reported definition of success”. The aim of any urethral intervention is to allow patients to return to a normal state of voiding while maintaining QoL or to minimise symptoms, reduce disability, and improve HRQoL by restoring normal urinary function [562]. Even if the surgeon reconstructed a wide and patent urethra, if patients experience pain, sexual dysfunction or perceive their urinary function as not improved, they will not rate their outcome as successful [560]. On a multivariate analysis including both patient-reported and clinical parameters, urine flowmetry parameters failed to demonstrate significant contribution to satisfaction [563]. Kessler et al., reported that only 78.3% of patients with clinical success described themselves as (very) satisfied. More dissatisfaction significantly appeared with penile curvature, penile shortening, worsening of erectile function and impairment of sexual life [564]. Conversely, 80% of patients defined as clinical failures considered themselves as (very) satisfied with their outcomes [564]. Regardless of anatomic success after urethroplasty, post-operative pain, sexual dysfunction and persistent LUTS were independent predictors of patient dissatisfaction [563]. Improvement in voiding function (i.e., statistical improvement on IPSS) alone does not predict patient satisfaction after urethroplasty [565]. On a multivariate analysis including both patient-reported and clinical parameters, after adjusting for disease recurrence and age, persistence in voiding symptoms (weak stream), genitourinary pain, and post-operative sexual function alterations were the greatest independent drivers of post-operative dissatisfaction [563]. In addition, penile shortening (OR: 2.26; 95% CI: 1.39-3.69) and chordee (OR: 2.26; 95% CI: 1.44-4.19) were independent predictors of patient dissatisfaction after urethroplasty [565] (Table 11.1).

Due to this evident discrepancy between surgeon’s assessment and patient assessment, PROMs have been developed for the follow-up after urethroplasty [160,562]. A complete approach for urethral surgery outcomes would combine both anatomic, endoscopic, and Patient-reported success [560,566]. The Panel suggest using a functional definition of success in clinical practice, namely “lack of symptoms and/or need for further interventions”. Collecting standardised documentation of the patient’s subjective assessment of their symptoms and objective anatomic outcomes would be limited for academic purposes, in order to allow comparison of surgical outcomes among reconstructive urologic surgeons and centres. Those objective and subjective outcomes measures should therefore be assessed and reported (simultaneously but separately) when evaluating urethroplasty results [560].
