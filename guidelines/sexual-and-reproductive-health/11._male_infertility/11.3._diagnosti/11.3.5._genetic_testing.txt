11.3.5. Genetic testing. All urologists working in andrology must have an understanding of the genetic abnormalities most commonly associated with infertility, so that they can provide correct advice to couples seeking fertility treatment. Current routine clinical practice in genetic testing is based on the screening of genomic DNA from peripheral blood samples. However, screening of chromosomal anomalies in spermatozoa (sperm aneuploidy) and preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) are also feasible and indicated in selected cases (e.g., recurrent miscarriage) [1584-1590]. 11.3.5.1. Chromosomal abnormalities Chromosomal abnormalities can be numerical (e.g., trisomy) or structural (e.g., inversions or translocations). In a survey of pooled data from 11 publications, including 9,766 infertile men, the incidence of chromosomal abnormalities was 5.8% [1591]. Of these, sex chromosome abnormalities accounted for 4.2% and autosomal abnormalities for 1.5%. In comparison, the incidence of abnormalities was 0.38% in pooled data from three series, with a total of 94,465 new-born male infants, of whom 131 (0.14%) had sex chromosomal abnormalities and 232 (0.25%) autosomal abnormalities [1591]. The frequency of chromosomal abnormalities increases as testicular deficiency becomes more severe. Patients with sperm count < 5 million/mL already show a 10-fold higher incidence (4%) of mainly autosomal structural abnormalities compared to the general population [1592,1593]. Men with NOA are at highest risk, especially for sex chromosomal anomalies (e.g., Klinefelter syndrome) [1594,1595]. Based on the frequencies of chromosomal aberrations in patients with different sperm concentration, karyotype analysis is currently indicated in men with azoospermia or oligozoospermia (spermatozoa < 10 million/mL) [1593]. Notwithstanding, the clinical value of spermatozoa < 10 million/mL remains a valid threshold until further studies, evaluating the cost-effectiveness, in which costs of adverse events due to chromosomal abnormalities (e.g., miscarriages and children with congenital anomalies) are performed [1596]. 11.3.5.1.1. Sex chromosome abnormalities (Klinefelter syndrome and variants ) Klinefelter syndrome is the most common sex chromosomal abnormality [1597]. Adult men with Klinefelter syndrome usually have small firm testes along with features of primary hypogonadism. The phenotype is the final result of a combination between genetic, hormonal and age-related factors [12]. The phenotype varies from that of a normally virilised male to one with the stigmata of androgen deficiency. In most cases infertility and reduced testicular volume are the only clinical features that can be detected. Leydig cell function is also commonly impaired in men with Klinefelter syndrome and thus testosterone deficiency is more frequently observed than in the general population [1598], although rarely observed during the peri-pubertal period, which usually occurs in a normal manner [12,1599]. Rarely, more pronounced signs and symptoms of hypogonadism can be present, along with congenital abnormalities including heart and renal problems [1600]. The presence of germ cells and sperm production are variable in men with Klinefelter syndrome and are more frequently observed in mosaicism, 46,XY/47,XXY. In patients with azoospermia, TESE or mTESE are therapeutic options as spermatozoa can be recovered in up to 50% of cases [1601,1602]. Although the data are not unique [1602], there is growing evidence that TESE or mTESE yields higher sperm recovery rates when performed at a younger age [1594,1603]. Since Klinefelter syndrome is associated with several general health problems, appropriate medical follow-up is therefore advised [13,1604,1605]. Testosterone therapy may be considered if testosterone levels are in the hypogonadal range when fertility issues have been addressed [15]. Moreover, men with Klinefelter syndrome are at higher risk of metabolic and cardiovascular diseases (CVD), including venous thromboembolism (VTE) and diabetes, particularly when starting testosterone therapy [1606]. In addition, a higher risk of haematological malignancies has been reported in men with Klinefelter syndrome [13]. Testicular sperm extraction in peri-pubertal or pre-pubertal boys with Klinefelter syndrome aiming at cryopreservation of testicular spermatogonial stem cells is still considered experimental and should only be performed within a research setting [1607]. The same applies to sperm retrieval in older boys who have not considered their fertility potential [1608]. 11.3.5.1.2. Autosomal abnormalities Genetic counselling should be offered to all couples seeking fertility treatment (including IVF/ICSI) when the male partner has an autosomal karyotype abnormality. The most common autosomal karyotype abnormalities are Robertsonian translocations, reciprocal translocations, paracentric inversions, and marker chromosomes. It is important to look for these structural chromosomal anomalies because there is an increased associated risk of aneuploidy or unbalanced chromosomal complements in the foetus. When IVF/ICSI is carried out for men with translocations, PGD or amniocentesis should be performed [1609,1610]. 11.3.5.2. Cystic fibrosis gene mutations Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal-recessive disorder [1611]. It is the most common genetic disease of Caucasians; 4% are carriers of gene mutations involving the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene located on chromosome 7p. It encodes a membrane protein that functions as an ion channel and influences the formation of the ejaculatory duct, seminal vesicle, vas deferens and distal two-thirds of the epididymis. Approximately 2,000 CFTR mutations have been identified and any CFTR alteration may lead to congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD). However, only those with homozygous mutations exhibit CF disease [1612]. Congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens is a rare reason of male factor infertility, which is found 1% of infertile men and in up to 6% of men with obstructive azoospermia [1613]. Clinical diagnosis of absent vasa is easy to miss and all men with azoospermia should be carefully examined to exclude CBAVD, particularly those semen volume < 1.0 mL and acidic pH < 7.0 [1614-1616]. In patients with CBAVD-only or CF, epididymal sperm aspiration (micro or percutaneous; MESA and PESA respectively), TESA, or TESE in combination with ICSI, can be used to achieve pregnancy. However, higher sperm quality, easier sperm retrieval and better ICSI outcomes are associated with CBAVD-only patients as compared with CF patients [1612]. The most frequently found mutations are F508, R117H and W1282X (according to their traditional definitions), but their frequency and the presence of other mutations largely depend on the ethnicity of the patient [1617,1618]. Given the functional relevance of a DNA variant (the 5T allele) in a non-coding region of CFTR [1619], it is now considered a mild CFTR mutation rather than a polymorphism and it should be analysed in each CBAVD patient. Men with CBAVD often have mild clinical stigmata of CF (e.g., history of chest infections). When a man has CBAVD, it is important to test his partner for CF mutations. If the female partner is found to be a carrier of CFTR mutations, the couple must consider carefully whether to proceed with ICSI, as the risk of having a child with CF or CBAVD will be 50%, depending on the type of mutations carried by the parents. If the female partner is negative for known mutations, the risk of being a carrier of unknown mutations is ~0.4% [1620]. 11.3.5.2.1. Unilateral or bilateral absence/abnormality of the vas and renal anomalies Congenital unilateral absence of the vas deferens (CUAVD) is usually associated with ipsilateral absence of the kidney and probably has a different genetic causation [1621]. Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene mutation screening is indicated in men with unilateral absence of the vas deferens with normal kidneys. The prevalence of renal anomalies is rare for patients who have CBAVD and CFTR mutations [1622]. Abdominal US should be undertaken both in unilateral and bilateral absence of vas deferens without CFTR mutations. Findings may range from CUAVD with ipsilateral absence of the kidney, to bilateral vessel and renal abnormalities, such as pelvic kidney [1623]. 11.3.5.3. Y microdeletions – partial and complete Microdeletions on the Y-chromosome are termed AZFa, AZFb and AZFc deletions [1624]. Clinically relevant deletions remove partially, or in most cases completely, one or more of the AZF regions, and are the most frequent molecular genetic cause of severe oligozoospermia and azoospermia [1625]. In each AZF region, there are several spermatogenesis candidate genes [1626]. 11.3.5.3.1. Clinical implications of  Y microdeletions The clinical significance of Yq microdeletions can be summarised as follows: They are not found in normozoospermic men, proving there is a clear cut cause-and-effect relationship between Y-deletions and spermatogenic failure [1627].The highest frequency of Y-deletions is found in azoospermic men (8-12%), followed by oligozoospermic (3-7%) men [1628,1629].Deletions are extremely rare with a sperm concentration > 5 million/mL (~0.7%) [1630].AZFc deletions are most common (65-70%), followed by Y-deletions of the AZFb and AZFb+c or AZFa+b+c regions (25-30%). AZFa region deletions are rare (5%) [1631].Complete deletion of the AZFa region is associated with severe testicular phenotype (Sertoli cell only syndrome [SCOS]), while complete deletions of the AZFb region is associated with spermatogenic arrest. Complete deletions that include the AZFa and AZFb regions are of poor prognostic significance for retrieving sperm with TESE. Therefore, TESE should not be attempted in these patients [1632,1633].Deletions of the AZFc region causes a variable phenotype ranging from azoospermia to oligozoospermia.Testicular sperm can be found in 50-75% of men with AZFc microdeletions [1632-1634].Men with AZFc microdeletions who are oligo-azoospermic or in whom sperm is found at the time of TESE must be counselled that any male offspring will inherit the deletion.Classical (complete) AZF deletions do not confer a risk for cryptorchidism or testicular cancer [1630,1635]. The specificity and genotype/phenotype correlation reported above means that Y-deletion analysis has both a diagnostic and prognostic value for testicular sperm retrieval [1635]. 11.3.5.3.1.1. Testing for Y microdeletion Historically, indications for AZF deletion screening are based on sperm count and include azoospermia and severe oligozoospermia (spermatozoa count < 5 million/mL). A meta-analysis assessing the prevalence of microdeletions on the Y chromosome in oligo-zoospermic men in 37 European and North American studies (n1398042195=139804219512,492 oligo-zoospermic men) showed that the majority of microdeletions occurred in men with sperm concentrations ≤ 1 million sperm/mL, with < 1% identified in men with > 1 million sperm/mL [1630]. In this context, while an absolute threshold for clinical testing cannot be universally given, patients may be offered testing if sperm counts are < 5 million sperm/mL, but must be tested if ≤1 million sperm/mL. With the contribution of the European Academy of Andrology (EAA) guidelines and the European Molecular Genetics Quality Network external quality control programme (http://www.emqn.org/emqn/), Yq testing has become more reliable in different routine genetic laboratories. The EAA guidelines provide a set of primers capable of detecting > 95% of clinically relevant deletions [1636].
