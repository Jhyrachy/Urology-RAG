5.3.2.5. diode laser enucleation prostate. mechanism action: prostate surgery, diode lasers wavelength 940, 980, 1,318, 1,470 nm (depending semiconductor used) marketed vaporisation enucleation. evaluated clinical trials . efficacy: one rct comparing 1,318 nm diode laser enucleation prostate (dilep) b-turp patients mean prostate volume < 80 ml reported significant differences ipss, qol score, qmax pvr six months follow-up . another rct comparing 1,470 nm dilep b-turp patients mean prostate volume < 80 ml also reported significant differences ipss, qol score, qmax pvr twelve months follow-up . addition, three rcts comparing 980 nm dilep pkep patients mean prostate volume < 80 ml > 80 ml reported significant differences ipss, qol score, qmax pvr twelve months follow-up. rct dilep (980 nm) vs. holep detected significant difference qmax, pvr, ipss, qol within twelve months follow‚Äêup . tolerability safety: one small rct comparing 1,318 nm dilep b-turp patients mean prostate volume < 80 ml six months follow-up reported significantly longer operation time dilep, shorter catheterisation hospitalisation times, well less blood loss (without differences blood transfusion rates) . differences complication rates reported two arms . another rct comparing 1,470 nm dilep b-turp patients prostate volume < 80 ml twelve months follow-up reported significantly shorter operation, catheterisation, hospitalisation times less blood loss (without differences blood transfusion rates) dilep, differences complication rates two arms . three rcts comparing 980 nm dilep pkep patients prostate volume < 80 ml > 80 ml twelve months follow-up reported conflicting peri-operative outcomes. trials reported differences blood transfusion rates complication rates [442-444]. rct dilep (980 nm) vs. holep twelve months follow-up demonstrated significant difference peri-operative outcomes including operation hospitalisation times . practical considerations: diode laser enucleation seems offer similar efficacy safety compared either b-turp bipolar transurethral (plasmakinetic) enucleation. based limited number mainly low-quality rcts, controversial data retreatment rate, results dilep evaluated higher quality rcts. summary evidencelelaser enucleation prostate using 1,318 nm 1,470 laser showed comparable short-term efficacy safety b-turp. peri-operative parameters like blood loss, catheterisation time hospital stay favour diode enucleation.1blaser enucleation prostate using 980 nm laser showed comparable short-term efficacy safety bipolar transurethral (plasmakinetic) enucleation.1b recommendationstrength ratingoffer 120-w 980 nm, 1,318 nm 1,470 nm diode laser enucleation prostate men moderate-to-severe luts comparable alternative bipolar transurethral (plasmakinetic) enucleation bipolar transurethral resection prostate.weak
