(2) clean-catch urine (ccu) collection: infant placed lap caregiver member nursing staff, holds sterile foil bowl underneath infant’s genitalia. infant offered oral fluids urine collection awaited . suprapubic tapping alternated paravertebral lumbar massage stimulate sponateous voiding . seems good correlation results urine culture obtained method suprapubic aspiration (spa), false-positive rate 5% false-negative rate 12% ; however, contamination rate higher ccu 26% compared catheterisation 10% spa 1% . one prospective cohort study infants age six months, success rate 49% contamination rate 16% differences culture results obtained ccu invasive methods . (3) transurethral bladder catheterisation: fastest safest method obtain reliable urine sample fo microscopic bacteriological evaluation rule document uti non-toilet trained infants children. (4) suprapubic bladder aspiration: invasive also sensitive method obtain uncontaminated urine sample age group . suprapubic puncture ultrasound imaging performed asses bladder filling. two-step procedure ccu screened catheter spa confirmation positive screens used lead reduction invasive procedures . older, toilet-trained children void command, carefully retracting foreskin cleaning glans penis boys spreading labia cleaning peri-urethral area girls, use clean catch, especially midstream urine, could acceptable technique obtaining urine. cleaning urethral meatus perineum gauze liquid soap twice, risk contamination reduced 23.9% (41/171) 7.8% (14/171) randomised trial . 3.10.3.4.2. urinalysis three methods commonly used urinalysis: (1) dipsticks: appealing provide rapid results, require microscopy, ready use. leukocyte esterase (as surrogate marker pyuria) nitrite (which converted dietary nitrates gram-negative enteric bacteria urine) frequent markers, usually combined dipstick test. conversion dietary nitrates nitrites bacteria takes approximately four hours bladder . using nitrate sticks screen febrile children < 2 years age low sensitivity relevant utis missed. however, specificity high children age . febrile infants < 90 days old urine dipstick tests using ccu samples used screening uti nitrites leukocyte esterase combined used sensitivity 86% specificity 80% . (2) microscopy: standard method assessing pyuria centrifugation urine threshold five white blood cells (wbcs) per high-power field (25 wbc/μl) . uncentrifuged urine, > 10 wbc/μl demonstrated sensitive uti could perform well clinical situations . however, rarely done outpatient setting. significant differences found dipsticks microscopy testing uti . meta-analysis showed, microscopy gram staining higer sensitivity compared dipsticks . (3) flow imaging analysis technology: used increasingly classify particles uncentrifuged urine specimens . numbers wbcs, squamous epithelial cells red cells correlate well found manual methods . flow cytometry-based bacterial leukocyte count analysis using cut-off value 250 bacteria/ul presence leukocyturia sensitivity 0.97 specificity 0.91 diagnosing uti . 3.10.3.4.3. urine culture negative results dipstick, microscopic automated urinalysis, urine culture generally necessary, especially alternative source fever. dipstick result positive, confirmation urine culture strongly recommended. unclear represents significant uti. patients severe uti, ≥ 105 cfu/ml expected. however, count vary related method specimen collection, diuresis, time temperature storage cultivation occurs . clean-catch urine, midstream catheterisation urine cultures considered positive 103 - 104 cfu/ml monoculture, counts obtained spa considered significant. mixed cultures indicative contamination. febrile children < 4 months age cut-off value 103 cfu/ml used clinical laboratory findings match correct sampling method used . negative culture presence pyuria may due incomplete antibiotic treatment, urolithiasis, foreign bodies urinary tract, infections caused mycobacterium tuberculosis chlamydia trachomatis. flowchart developed guidance basic diagnostic evaluation subsequent management febrile children clinical symptoms uti, figure 5. figure 5: diagnostic evaluation subsequent management febrile child clinical symptoms uticrp = c-reactive protein; ab = antibiotic. 3.10.3.5. imaging 3.10.3.5.1. ultrasound renal bladder us within 24 hours advised infants febrile uti exclude obstruction upper lower urinary tract. abnormal results found 15% cases, 1-2% abnormalities require prompt action (e.g., additional evaluation, referral surgery) . renal us performed children presenting uti, 7% abnormal us warranting investigations . sensitivity detect high-grade vur us found 0.59 (ci: 0.45-0.72) specificity 0.79 (ci: 0.65-0.87) . renal us performed voiding. post-void residual (pvr) urine measured toilet-trained children exclude voiding abnormalities cause uti. elevated pvr urine volume predicts recurrence utis toilet-trained children . peri-renal psoas abcesses renal masses seen us, important consider xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis, subsequent ct imaging proposed . 3.10.3.5.2. radionuclide scanning/mri changes dimercaptosuccinic acid (dmsa) clearance acute uti indicate pyelonephritis parenchymal damage, correlated presence dilating reflux risk pyelonephritis episodes, breakthrough infections future renal scarring. acute phase febrile uti (up four six weeks), dmsa-scan demonstrate pyelonephritis perfusion defects. renal scars detected three six months . diffusion-weighted mri shown accurately diagnose acute pyelonephritis reveal late renal scars could alternative dmsa; therefore, avoiding radion burden . average effective radiation dose single dmsa scan 2.84 (1-12) msv one study . findings different neonates. first symptomatic, community-acquired uti, majority renal units vur grade iii higher normal early dmsa scanning . sensitivity dmsa scan detect vur 0.75 (ci: 0.67-0.81) specificity 0.48 (ci: 0.38-0.57), negative dmsa scan resulting low probability high-grade vur . 3.10.3.5.3. voiding cystourethrography/urosonography optimum method exclude confirm vur vcug. timing vcug influence presence severity vur . performance early vcug patients proven sterile urine cause significant morbidity . using harmonic voiding urosonography may alternative standard vcug avoiding radiation . visulatisation urethra may difficult technique. important diagnose high-grade vur first uti since important risk renal scarring. hand, physicians want avoid unnecessary vcug investigations time, given invasive character radiation burden . various studies investigated risk factors high-grade vur top approach feasible. important risk factors high-grade vur subsequent renal scarring are: abnormal renal us, high fever uti non-e. coli infections. different top strategies selective vcug investigations proposed [512-516]. based studies recommend following updated diagnostic strategy (see figure 6). figure 6: diagnosis strategy first febrile utiuti = urinary tract infection; vur = vesicoureteral reflux; i.v. = intravenous; bbd = bladder bowl dysfunction.
