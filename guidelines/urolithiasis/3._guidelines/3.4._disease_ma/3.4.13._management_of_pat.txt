3.4.13. Management of patients with residual stones. Following initial treatment with SWL, URS or PCNL, residual fragments may remain and require additional intervention [347,402-405]. Most of these studies indicate that initial imaging is performed on the first day or the first week after treatment. However, false positive results from dust or residual fragments, that will pass spontaneously without causing any stone-related event, might lead to over-treatment. Therefore, imaging at four weeks seems most appropriate [406-408]. Compared to US, KUB and IVU, NCCT scan has a higher sensitivity to detect small residual fragments after definitive treatment of ureteral or kidney stones [409,410]. A SR/MA examining residual fragments following any treatment has demonstrated that around a third of patients with either dust or fragments </= 4 mm experience disease progression and re-intervention within three years, whilst a third have spontaneous passage within two years regardless of imaging modality follow-up. For fragments > 4 mm, there are fewer studies, but these suggest low spontaneous passage rates and high intervention rates [411]. Although NCCT has the highest sensitivity to detect residual fragments, this must be balanced to the exposure to ionising radiation when compared with KUB and US. Recurrence risk in patients with residual fragments after treatment of infection stones is higher than for other stones [412]. 3.4.13.1.
