4.5.1. Introduction. Bladder outlet obstruction is defined by the ICS as “obstruction during voiding, characterised by increased detrusor pressure and reduced urine flow rate” [1]. Its precise diagnosis requires urodynamic evaluation including an assessment of pressure and flow. Voiding dysfunction has previously been defined in Section 4.4. In women, voiding dysfunction can be caused by BOO or DU [1]. There are also non-obstructive causes and therefore voiding dysfunction, and BOO should not be used interchangeably. Another term that must be differentiated from BOO and voiding dysfunction is dysfunctional voiding, which is a specific and discrete form of voiding dysfunction characterised by an intermittent and/or fluctuating flow rate due to involuntary intermittent contractions of the peri-urethral striated muscle during voiding in neurologically normal individuals [113].
