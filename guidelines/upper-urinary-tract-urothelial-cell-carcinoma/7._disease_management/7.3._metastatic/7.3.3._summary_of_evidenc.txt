7.3.3. Summary of evidence and recommendations for the treatment of metastatic UTUC. Summary of evidenceLEEnfortmab vedotin + Pembrolizumab offers an overall survival benefit compared to gemcitabine-cisplatin in the 1st line setting.1bCisplatin-based combination chemotherapy can improve median survival.2Cisplatin-containing combination chemotherapy is the standard of care in advanced or metastatic patients fit enough to tolerate cisplatin and who are ineligible for Enfortumab + Pembrolizumab.1bCisplatin-containing combination chemotherapy in combination with nivolumab offers a survival advantage compared with chemotherapy alone in the 1st line setting.1bCarboplatin-based combination chemotherapy offers a survival benefit in cisplatin unfit patients.1bNon-platinum combination chemotherapy has not been tested against standard chemotherapy in patients who are fit or unfit for cisplatin combination chemotherapy.4Maintenance avelumab is associated with an OS advantage compared with best supportive care in patients who did not have disease progression after 4 to 6 cycles of gemcitabine plus either cisplatin or carboplatin.1bPD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab has been approved for patients who have experienced disease progression during or after previous platinum-based chemotherapy and did not receive previous immune therapy based on the results of a phase III trial.1bPD-1 inhibitor nivolumab has been approved for patients that have experienced disease progression during or after previous platinum-based chemotherapy and did not receive previous immune therapy based on the results of a phase II trial.2aPD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab has been approved for patients with advanced or metastatic UC unfit for platinum-based first-line chemotherapy based on the results of a phase II trial but use of pembrolizumab is restricted to PD-L1 positive patients.2aPD-L1 inhibitor atezolizumab has been approved for patients with advanced or metastatic UC unfit for platinum-based first-line chemotherapy based on the results of a phase II trial, but use of atezolizumab is restricted to PD-L1 positive patients.2aErdafitinib was associated with improved overall survival in platinum-refractory patients with locally- advanced or metastatic UC and FGFR DNA genomic alterations (FGFR2/3 mutations or FGFR3 fusions).1bEnfortumab vedotin was associated with OS benefit in patients who had previously received platinum- containing chemotherapy and experienced disease progression during or after treatment with a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor.1bPalliative nephroureterectomy can improve quality of life by controlling symptomatic disease.3RNU can confer a survival benefit in highly selected patients with metastatic UC e.g., after response to platinum-based combination chemotherapy with limited metastatic burden.4 RecommendationsStrength ratingOffer Enfortumab vedotin in combination with pembrolizumab as first line treatment to patients with advanced/metastatic disease.StrongFirst-line treatment for platinum-eligible patients who are unsuitable/ineligible forEnfortumab + PembrolizumabOffer platinum combination chemotherapy to platinum-eligible patients.StrongOffer cisplatin based chemotherapy with gemcitabine-cisplatin + nivolumab in cisplatin eligible patients.WeakOffer cisplatin-based chemotherapy with gemcitabine/cisplatin or HD-MVAC to cisplatin- eligible patients.StrongOffer gemcitabine/carboplatin chemotherapy to cisplatin-ineligible patients.StrongOffer maintenance avelumab to patients who did not have disease progression after 4 to 6 cycles of platinum-based combination chemotherapy.StrongFirst-line treatment in patients ineligible for any combination therapyOffer checkpoint inhibitors pembrolizumab or atezolizumab to patients with PD-L1 positive tumours.WeakLater lines of treatmentOffer platinum based combination chemotherapy as second line treatment of choice if not received in the first line setting.StrongOffer checkpoint inhibitor (pembrolizumab) to patients with disease progression during or after platinum-based combination chemotherapy for metastatic disease who did not receive maintenance avelumab.StrongOffer enfortumab vedotin to patients previously treated with platinum-containing chemotherapy and who had disease progression during or after treatment with a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor.StrongTest UTUC patients for FGFR alterations (FGFR2/3 mutations or FGFR3 fusions) prior to erdafitinib treatment.StrongOffer erdafitinib as an alternative subsequent-line therapy to patients:previously treated with platinum-containing chemotherapy;who had disease progression during or after treatment with a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor;who harbour FGFR DNA genomic alterations (FGFR2/3 mutations or FGFR3 fusions).StrongOnly offer vinflunine to patients with metastatic disease as second-line treatment if immunotherapy or combination chemotherapy is not feasible. Alternatively, offer vinflunine as third- or subsequent-line treatment.StrongOffer nephroureterectomy as a palliative treatment to symptomatic patients with resectable locally-advanced tumours.Weak DNA = deoxyribonucleic acid; FGFR = fibroblast growth factor receptors; HD-MVAC = high-dose intensity methotrexate, vinblastine, adriamycin plus cisplatin; PD-L1 = programmed death ligand 1.
