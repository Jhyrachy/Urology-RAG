3.18.2. International Consensus Statements on DSD Management. There have been four published consensus statements in relation to the investigations and management of DSD. In general, these statements have focused on the impact of DSD on older age groups, the importance of long-term prospective multi-disciplinary, multi-centre data collection with a focus on patient reported outcomes. The ultimate ambition is to preserve physical and psychological function in these future adults [1259]. The consensus proposal from European Society of Paediatric Radiology task force predominantly focused on imaging modalities and calls for the optimisation of US in initial and interval assessments of anatomy, with MR imaging and cystovaginography used as adjunctive modalities [1260]. The COST Action BM1303 working group 1 consensus statement from Europe raised the concern of the effects of delayed genital and gonadal surgery on physical, psychological, and sexual well-being, as well as the potential malignant risks of retained gonads. Support tools need to be developed to help guide affected families and children with a balance struck between surgery and the protection of human rights [1258]. The Canadian consensus statement broadly concurs with the above but differs slightly from their European counterparts. It suggests that sex assignment need not take place at birth, and there should be a recognition of the harms caused in the past by a paucity of information to parents, and that decisions involving surgery should take place involving a shared decision model. This consensus finally suggests that data is insufficient to determine the correct timing of surgery [1261].
