3.1.3. donor kidney biopsies. donor kidney biopsies serve different purposes including: histological assessment organ quality prior transplantation (often referred procurement harvest biopsies);histological analysis focal lesions, especially suspicion neoplasia;detection donor derived lesions reference subsequent post-transplant biopsies (often referred baseline, zero-time implantation biopsies). 3.1.3.1. procurement biopsies 3.1.3.1.1 background prognostic value procurement biopsies used detection tissue injury aid decision whether deceased donor kidney suitable transplantation. biopsies commonly performed donors clinical suspicion chronic kidney injury (ecds) . kidney discard europe rarely based histology findings , procurement biopsies regularly performed graft allocation eurotransplant region . however, since biopsy findings frequent cause discarding donor organs united states [60-63], prognostic value analysed numerous studies. recently published systematic review studies donor kidney biopsies revealed lack prospective studies marked heterogeneity regarding type lesions assessed, scoring, definitions post-transplant outcomes statistical methods employed . therefore, published evidence suggests use procurement biopsies deciding suitability transplantation donor kidneys may important limitations including following : consistent association histological lesions observed donor kidney biopsies post-transplant outcomes. concept procurement biopsies elderly donors introduced study gaber et al., 1995. study observed significantly worse outcomes recipients kidneys > 20% globally sclerotic glomeruli . however, subsequent studies yielded highly variable results cannot concluded glomerulosclerosis independently associated graft outcomes . similar variability also observed potentially relevant lesions like arterial injury, interstitial fibrosis tubular atrophy showing predictive value studies, others . agreement prognostically relevant lesions scored. specific grading systems donor kidney biopsies yet developed. lesion scoring pre-transplant biopsies mostly based banff consensus post-transplant renal allograft pathology, supported 2007 banff conference report . many attempts made use composite semi-quantitative scoring systems express global extent tissue injury donor kidney biopsies. scoring systems mostly based simple addition banff scores individual lesions, commonly glomerulosclerosis, arteriolar hyalinosis, arterial intimal fibrosis, interstitial fibrosis tubular atrophy rarely include clinical parameters like donor age , serum creatinine values donor hypertension . limited number histological scoring systems based modelling analysis [68-72]. maryland aggregate pathology

explain conflicting conclusions literature . due time constraints organ allocation procurement biopsies mostly read frozen sections on-call pathologists, might affect diagnostic reliability reported
