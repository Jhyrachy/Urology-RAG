3.22.3. paediatric bladder injuries. paediatric bladder less protected adult bladder, therefore susceptible injuries, especially full, due to: higher position abdomen exposure bony pelvis.the fact abdominal wall provides less muscular protection.the fact less pelvic abdominal fat surrounding bladder cushion trauma. blunt trauma common cause significant bladder injury. adults, bladder injury often associated pelvic fractures. less common children paediatric bladder sits pelvic ring. large prospective study, 57% children pelvic fractures also bladder injury compared 89% adults . 3.22.3.1. diagnostic evaluation characteristic signs bladder injury suprapubic pain tenderness, inability urinate, visible haematuria (95% injuries). patients pelvic fracture visible haematuria present bladder rupture 45% cases . diagnosis bladder rupture difficult cases. bladder imaged fully distended drainage using standard radiography axial imaging (e.g., ct scan). optimal imaging results achieved retrograde filling bladder using catheter. despite advances ct imaging, bladder must still filled capacity accurately diagnose possible bladder injury . blunt injuries bladder categorised as: contusions damage bladder mucosa muscle, without loss bladder wall continuity extravasation.ruptures, either intraperitoneal extraperitoneal. intraperitoneal bladder ruptures common children bladderâ€™s exposed position acute increase pressure trauma. cause bladder rupture weakest point, i.e., dome. extraperitoneal lesions occur lower half bladder almost always associated pelvic fractures. cystogram demonstrate extravasation perivesical soft tissue typical flame pattern contrast material confined pelvis. 3.22.3.2. management contusions usually present varying degrees haematuria treated catheter drainage alone. 3.22.3.2.1. intraperitoneal injuries accepted management intraperitoneal bladder ruptures open surgical exploration primary repair. post-operative drainage suprapubic tube mandatory. recent data suggest transurethral drainage may effective, fewer complications, resulting shorter periods diversion . usually, seven ten days, repeat cystogram performed ensure adequate healing. 3.22.3.2.2. extraperitoneal injuries non-operative, supportive management catheter drainage seven ten days method choice extraperitoneal bladder rupture. however, bone fragments within bladder, must removed bladder must repaired drained, according principles treating intraperitoneal ruptures . 3.22.3.3. recommendations diagnosis management paediatric bladder injuries recommendationsstrength ratinguse retrograde cystography diagnose suspected bladder injuries.strongensure bladder filled full capacity additional film taken drainage.strongmanage extra-peritoneal bladder ruptures conservatively transurethral catheter left place seven ten days.strongperform surgical exploration cases intra-peritoneal bladder ruptures.strong
