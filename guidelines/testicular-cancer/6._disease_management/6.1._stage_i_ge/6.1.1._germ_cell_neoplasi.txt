6.1.1. Germ cell neoplasia “in situ” (GCNIS). If GCNIS is diagnosed and the contralateral testis is normal, options include orchidectomy or close observation, as the five-year risk of developing TC is 50% [93]. In a solitary testis, local radiotherapy (18-20 Gy in fractions of 2 Gy) should be considered [94-97]. Radiotherapy to a solitary testis will result in infertility and increased long-term risk of Leydig cell insufficiency [94]. Fertile patients who wish to father children may defer radiation therapy and be monitored with regular testicular US [70]. Chemotherapy is ineffective to reliably irradicate GCNIS [98,99].
