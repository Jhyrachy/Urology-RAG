4.1.4.2.3. Anticholinergics and beta-3 agonists: elderly patients and cognition. Systematic reviews have included sections on the efficacy and safety of anticholinergics in elderly patients [163,165] but an older SR found inconclusive evidence of the impact of anticholinergics on cognition [198]. Two more recent longitudinal cohort studies in patients using anticholinergic drugs showed deterioration in cognitive function, alteration in central nervous system metabolism and an association with brain atrophy [199,200]. As most of the study periods are short (four to twelve weeks), the long-term impact of anticholinergic agents specifically approved for OAB treatment on specific patient cohorts are poorly understood [201-204]. Oxybutynin: There is evidence that oxybutynin IR may cause/worsen cognitive dysfunction in adults [201,203,205,206]. Whilst short-term trials showed no effect on recent memory or other cognitive functions [206], prospective studies showed cumulative cognitive deterioration associated with prolonged use (mean follow-up, 7.3 years) of anticholinergic medication including oxybutynin [199]. Another prospective cohort study including 376 nursing home residents aged 65 and older taking oxybutynin and tolterodine showed a decline in activity of daily living after a median follow-up of 141 days, in spite of concomitant treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors [207].Solifenacin: One pooled analysis [208] showed that solifenacin did not increase cognitive impairment in elderly patients. No age-related differences in the pharmacokinetics of solifenacin in different age groups were found, although more frequent adverse events in patients aged > 80 years were observed. No cognitive effect on healthy elderly volunteers was shown [209]. In a sub-analysis of a large trial, solifenacin 5–10 mg improved symptoms and QoL in people aged > 75 years who had not responded to tolterodine [210]. In patients with mild cognitive impairment, aged > 65 years, solifenacin showed no difference in efficacy between age groups and a lower incidence of most adverse effects compared to oxybutynin IR [206,211].Tolterodine: No change in efficacy or adverse effects related to age has been reported, although a higher discontinuation rate was found for both tolterodine and placebo in elderly patients [201]. Two RCTs in elderly patients found similar efficacy and adverse effect profile to those in younger patients [212-215]. Post hoc analysis has shown little effect on cognition. One non-randomised comparison showed lower rates of depression in elderly participants treated with tolterodine ER compared to oxybutynin IR [216]. Duration of the RCTs was short (twelve weeks).Darifenacin: Two RCTs in the elderly population (one in patients with UUI and the other in volunteers) concluded that, compared with placebo, darifenacin was effective with no risk of cognitive change, measured as memory scanning tests [217,218]. Another study on darifenacin and oxybutynin ER in elderly people concluded that the two agents had similar efficacy, but that cognitive function was more often affected in the oxybutynin ER arm [203].Trospium chloride: Trospium does not appear to cross the blood–brain barrier in healthy individuals due to its molecular characteristics (quaternary amine structure and hydrophilic properties). Two studies in healthy volunteers using electroencephalography showed no effect from trospium, while tolterodine caused occasional changes and oxybutynin caused consistent changes [219,220]. No evidence as to the comparative efficacy and adverse effect profiles of trospium in different age groups are available. However, there is some evidence that trospium does not impair cognitive function in Alzheimer’s disease patients if combined with cholinesterase inhibitors over a six month period [204], or in non-cognitively impaired patients over shorter periods (twelve weeks) [221] and that it is effective compared to placebo in the elderly [222].Fesoterodine: Pooled analyses of the RCTs of fesoterodine confirmed the efficacy of 8 mg but not 4 mg dose in patients aged > 75 years [178]. Adherence was lower in patients aged > 75 years but effects on mental status were not reported [170,178,223]. A more recent RCT showed efficacy of fesoterodine in vulnerable elderly people with no differences in cognitive function at twelve weeks [224].Mirabegron: Analysis of pooled data from three RCTs showed efficacy and safety of mirabegron in elderly patients [225].
