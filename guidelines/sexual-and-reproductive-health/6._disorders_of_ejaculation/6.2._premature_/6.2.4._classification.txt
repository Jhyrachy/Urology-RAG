6.2.4. Classification. There is still little consensus about the definition and classification of PE [595]. It is now universally accepted that “premature ejaculation” is a broad term that includes several concepts belonging to the common category of PE. The most recent definition comes from the International Classification of Diseases 11th Revision, where PE was renamed as Early Ejaculation [596]: “Male early ejaculation is characterized by ejaculation that occurs prior to or within a very short duration of the initiation of vaginal penetration or other relevant sexual stimulation, with no or little perceived control over ejaculation. The pattern of early ejaculation has occurred episodically or persistently over a period of at least several months and is associated with clinically significant distress.” This definition includes four categories: male early ejaculation, lifelong generalised and situational, acquired generalised and situational, and unspecified. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders V (DSM-V) [207] and the International Society for Sexual Medicine (ISSM) [597] published definitions for lifelong and acquired PE. These definitions are overlapping, with 3 shared factors (1. Time to ejaculation assessed by IELT; 2. Perceived control; and, 3. Distress, bother, frustration, interpersonal difficulty related to the ejaculatory dysfunction), resulting in a multi-dimensional diagnosis [597]. Two more PE syndromes have been proposed [552]: ‘Variable PE’ is characterised by inconsistent and irregular early ejaculations, representing a normal variation in sexual performance.‘Subjective PE’ is characterised by subjective perception of consistent or inconsistent rapid ejaculation during intercourse, while ejaculation latency time is in the normal range or can even last longer. It should not be regarded as a symptom or manifestation of true medical pathology [598].
