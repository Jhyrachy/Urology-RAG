3.5. radiation exposure protection endourology. diagnosis treatment nephrolithiasis associated high levels ionising radiation exposure patients . currently, studies estimating lifetime radiation exposure stone formers subsequent risk malignancy development. radiation exposure endourologists extensively studied. still, studies assessing risk radiation-induced malignancies urologists operating theatre staff members [525-527]. current evidence atomic bomb patients , retrospective epidemiological data medical exposure , modelling studies suggest age dose-dependent risk secondary malignancy ionising radiation. international commission radiological protection (icrp) recommends maximum annual occupational exposure 50msv . however, risk radiation-induced malignancy follows stochastic model known safe threshold exposure. taking consideration well length urologist’s career upper limit 50msv still highly concerning. table 3.12 shows eau urolithiasis guidelines panel recommended protection methods reduce radiation exposure patients, surgical, anaesthesiologic, nursing staff. table 3.12: radiation protection measures radiation protection measureslimit studies intervention involving radiation exposure strictly medically necessary.implement patient electronic record medical imaging.make use imaging studies lower radiation doses (us, kub, digital tomosynthesis, low-dose ultra-low dose ct scan).create follow precise radiation exposure protection protocol department.act accordance low reasonably achievable (alara) principle.measure report fluoroscopy time operative surgeon (use dosimeters perform monthly calculations).technical measures reduce radiation exposure include:reducing fluoroscopy time;limiting time adjacent patient;using low-dose radiation; irradiating observe motion;intra-operative use pulsed fluoroscopy;reduced fluoroscopy pulse rate;collimated fields;avoid digital image acquisition rely last image hold instant replay technology.use radiation protection instruments (chest, pelvic thyroid shields, lead lead-free gloves, protective glasses, lead protection operating table x-ray source surgeon).the radiation protection instruments must cared appropriately damage decreases effectiveness increases exposure risk. monitored measured regularly ensure integrity.proper surgeon operating room setup observed (follow inverse square law, use x-ray source underneath patient’s body, decrease x-ray source patient distance, reduce magnification, avoid field overlap turning c-arm extreme angles, operate standing rather seated position). availability fluoroscopy mandatory endourological procedures. increasing interest fluoroless fluoroscopy-free operations urology. several rcts published showing good outcome means stone-free complication rates [166,270,535-537]. trials limited non-complex cases sufficiently powered show non-inferiority fluoroscopy pcnl superiority ultrasound urs .
