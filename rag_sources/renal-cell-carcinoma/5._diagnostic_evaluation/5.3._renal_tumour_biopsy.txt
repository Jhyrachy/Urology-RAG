5.3. renal tumour biopsy. 5.3.1. indications rationale percutaneous renal tumour biopsy reveal histology radiologically indeterminate renal masses considered patients candidates small masses, obtain histology ablative treatments, select suitable medical surgical treatment strategy setting metastatic disease [148-153] (le: 3). multicentre study assessing 542 surgically removed srms showed likelihood benign findings pathology significantly lower centres biopsies performed (5% vs. 16%), suggesting biopsies reduce surgery benign tumours potential short-term long-term morbidity associated procedures . recent series patients underwent percutaneous biopsy srm, active treatment (surgery cryotherapy) avoided 50/182 patients (27.5%) benign diagnosis biopsy . renal biopsy indicated comorbid frail patients considered conservative management (watchful waiting) regardless biopsy results. due high diagnostic accuracy abdominal imaging, renal tumour biopsy necessary patients contrast-enhancing renal mass surgery planned (le: 4). core biopsies cystic renal masses lower diagnostic yield accuracy recommended, unless areas solid pattern present (bosniak iv cysts) (le: 2b/3). histological characterisation percutaneous biopsy undefined retroperitoneal masses imaging may useful decision making, especially younger patient population. 5.3.2. technique percutaneous sampling performed local anaesthesia needle core biopsy and/or fine needle aspiration (fna). biopsies performed us ct guidance, similar diagnostic yield (le: 2b). eighteen-gauge needles ideal core biopsies, result low morbidity provide sufficient tissue diagnosis (le: 2b). coaxial technique allowing multiple biopsies coaxial cannula always used avoid potential tumour seeding (le: 3). core biopsies preferred characterisation solid renal masses combination fna provide complimentary results improve accuracy complex cystic lesions (le: 2a). sr meta-analysis diagnostic performance complications renal tumour biopsy performed panel, including 57 publications total 5,228 patients. needle core biopsies found better accuracy diagnosis malignancy compared fna . studies showed solid pattern, larger tumour size exophytic location predictors diagnostic core biopsy (le: 2b). 5.3.3. diagnostic yield accuracy experienced centres, core biopsies high diagnostic yield, specificity, sensitivity diagnosis malignancy. above-mentioned meta-analysis showed sensitivity specificity diagnostic core biopsies diagnosis malignancy 99.1% 99.7%, respectively (le: 2b). however, 0–22.6% core biopsies non-diagnostic (8% meta-analysis) [149-153,157,158,161] (le: 2a). biopsy non-diagnostic, radiologic findings suspicious malignancy, biopsy surgical exploration considered (le: 4). repeat biopsies reported diagnostic high proportion cases (83–100%) [148,162-164]. accuracy renal tumour biopsies diagnosis tumour histotype good. median concordance rate tumour histotype renal tumour biopsy surgical specimen following pn rn 90.3% pooled analysis . assessment tumour grade core biopsies challenging. pooled analysis overall accuracy nuclear grading poor (62.5%), significantly improved (87%) using simplified two-tier system (high vs. low grade) (le: 2a). ideal number location core biopsies defined. however, least two good quality cores obtained necrotic areas avoided maximise diagnostic yield (le: 2b). peripheral biopsies preferable larger tumours, avoid areas central necrosis (le: 2b). ct2 greater renal masses, multiple core biopsies taken least four separate solid enhancing areas tumour shown achieve higher diagnostic yield higher accuracy identify sarcomatoid features, without increasing complication rate . 5.3.4. morbidity overall, percutaneous biopsies low morbidity . tumour seeding along needle tract regarded anecdotal large series pooled analyses renal tumour biopsies. especially coaxial technique regarded safe method avoid seeding tumour cells. however, authors recently reported seven patients tumour seeding identified histological examination resection specimen surgical resection rcc following diagnostic percutaneous biopsy . six seven cases prcc type. clinical significance findings still uncertain one patients developed local tumour recurrence site previous biopsy . spontaneously resolving subcapsular/perinephric haematomas reported 4.3% cases pooled analysis, clinically significant bleeding unusual (0-1.4%; 0.7% pooled analysis) generally self-limiting . percutaneous biopsy renal hilar masses technically feasible diagnostic yield similar cortical masses, significantly higher post-procedural bleeding compared cortical masses . 5.3.5. genetic assessment renal cancer related inherited de novo monogenic germline alteration recognition significant implications . hereditary kidney cancer thought account 5-8% kidney cancer cases, although number likely underestimation since recent study found germline mutations 38% metastatic kidney cancer patients (see section 3.4.4. - hereditary kidney tumours). patients germline predisposition kidney cancer often require multidisciplinary approaches, critical clinicians familiar referral counselling warranted, methods genetic testing, implications findings, screening at-risk (non-renal) organs, screening protocol family members. well-defined renal cancer management strategies exist, specific therapeutic strategies available development (see section 3.4.4). lack syndromic manifestation exclude genetic contribution cancer development. moreover, genetic components polymorphisms heritable may confer mildly increased risk. several risk alleles present, significantly increase cancer risk. many factors associated increased risk hereditary renal cancer syndromes. instance, even absence clinical manifestations personal/family history, age onset 46 years younger trigger consideration genetic counselling/germline mutation testing . moreover, presence bilateral multifocal tumours/cysts and/or first- second-degree relative rcc and/or close blood relative known pathogenic variant significantly increases risk detect hereditary cancer. presence renal cysts associated bhd vhl, form part clinical diagnostic spectrum. moreover, specific histologic characteristics support differential diagnosis particular rcc syndrome (e.g., multifocal papillary histology, hereditary fumarate hydratase-deficient rcc, rcc fumarate hydratase deficiency, multiple chromophobe, oncocytoma oncocytic hybrid, succinate dehydrogenase-deficient rcc histology). finally, additional tuberous sclerosis complex criteria assessed individuals aml [46,173-181]. additional risk factors established patient, referral comprehensive clinical care centre, hospital demonstrated expertise managing hereditary cancer syndromes, provide dedicated working team, tailored clinical decisions, research translational programme, appropriate patient psychosocial support, prospective collection clinical data biological samples. contribute better patient’s care improvements cancer care.
