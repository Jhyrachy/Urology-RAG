creatinine, sodium, potassium, chloride, ionised calcium (or total calcium + albumin), phosphate, uric acid; and, case increased calcium levels, parathyroid hormone (pth) vitamin d. urinalysis requires measurement urine volume, urine ph, specific weight, calcium, oxalate, uric acid, citrate, sodium, magnesium. figure 4.2 summarises diagnostic steps calcium oxalate stones. figure 4.2 diagnostic algorithm calcium oxalate stones 4.4.2. interpretation results aetiology common metabolic abnormalities associated calcium stone formation hypercalciuria, affects 30-60% adult stone formers, hyperoxaluria (26-67%), followed hyperuricosuria (15-46%), hypomagnesuria (7-23%), hypocitraturia (5-29%). however, ranges tend differ based ethnicity . elevated levels ionised calcium serum (or total calcium albumin) require assessment intact pth confirm exclude suspected hyperparathyroidism (hpt).consistently low ph (< 5.5) 24-hour urine ph < 5.5 may promote co-crystallisation uric acid calcium oxalate.similarly, increased uric acid excretion (> 4 mmol/day adults > 12 mg/kg/day children) act promoter.a ph > 6.2 24-hour urine collection may indicate rta provided uti excluded. ammonium chloride loading test confirms distal rta (section 4.6.5).hypercalciuria may associated normocalcemia (idiopathic hypercalciuria, granulomatous diseases) hypercalcemia (hyperparathyroidism, granulomatous diseases, vitamin excess, malignancy).hypocitraturia (male < 1.7 mmol/d, female < 1.9 mmol/d) may idiopathic secondary metabolic acidosis hypokalaemia.oxalate excretion > 0.5 mmol/day adults confirms hyperoxaluria (see table 4.3 values children).- primary hyperoxaluria (oxalate excretion mostly > 1 mmol/day), appears three genetically determined forms;- secondary hyperoxaluria (oxalate excretion > 0.5 mmol/day, usually < 1 mmol/day), occurs due intestinal hyperabsorption oxalate extreme dietary oxalate intake;- mild hyperoxaluria (oxalate excretion 0.45-0.85 mmol/day), commonly found idiopathic calcium oxalate stone formers.hypomagnesuria (< 3.0 mmol/day) may related poor dietary intake reduced intestinal absorption (chronic diarrhoea). figure 4.3: therapeutic
