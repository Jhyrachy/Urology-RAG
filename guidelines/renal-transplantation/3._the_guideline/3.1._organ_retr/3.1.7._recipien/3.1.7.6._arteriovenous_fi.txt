3.1.7.6. Arteriovenous fistulae and pseudo-aneurysms after renal biopsy. Percutaneous biopsy may result in arteriovenous (AV) fistulae and/or intra-renal pseudo-aneurysms in 1-18% of cases [195]. The aetiology of the AV fistula is related to the simultaneous injury of adjacent arterial and venous branches. A pseudo-aneurysm occurs when only the arterial branch is damaged. Both conditions are diagnosed with US-colour-Doppler [178]. The majority of AV fistulae are asymptomatic, resolving in one to two years spontaneously, whilst approximately 30% of them persist and become symptomatic. Typically, the symptoms are hypertension, haematuria, and graft dysfunction due to shunting between arterial and venous vessels. There is an increased risk of spontaneous rupture in case of enlarging pseudo-aneurysms. For both AV fistulae and pseudo-aneurysm, angiographic selective or super selective embolisation represents the treatment of choice [196]. Partial or radical allograft nephrectomy is currently considered the last option [178].
