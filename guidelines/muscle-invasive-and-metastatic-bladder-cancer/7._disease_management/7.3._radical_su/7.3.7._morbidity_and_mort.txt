7.3.7. Morbidity and mortality. In four retrospective studies and one population-based cohort study, the peri-operative mortality after RC was reported as 2.1–3.2% at 30 days and 3.4–8.0% at 90 days [390,391]. Morbidity rates differ strongly according to the reporting system used. Using the Clavien-Dindo Classification system complication rates ranged from 50–88% (I–IV) and severe complications from 30–42% (≥ III) [392-395]. In large national databases and institutional series, readmission rates are approximately 25% within 30 days of discharge [396]. Late morbidity was usually linked to the type of urinary diversion (see also above). Early morbidity associated with RC for NMIBC (at high risk for disease progression) is similar and no less than that associated with muscle-invasive tumours [397,398]. In general, lower morbidity and (peri-operative) mortality have been observed by surgeons and in hospitals with a higher case load and therefore more experience [399-402]. A retrospective analysis of 1,303 patients managed in 7 (non-academic) Dutch hospitals revealed variation in treatment preferences between them; however, despite this there was no significant difference in overall survival [403].

This label indicates the need for a follow-up to fully evaluate the complication. 1 A systematic review showed that peri-operative blood transfusion (PBT) in patients who undergo RC correlates with increased overall mortality, CSM and cancer recurrence. The authors hypothesised that this may be caused by the suggested immunosuppressive effect of PBT. In a retrospective study, Buchner and co-workers showed 5-year decreased CSS in cases where intra-operative blood transfusion (CSS decreased from 67% to 48%) or post-operative blood transfusion (CSS decreased from 63% to 48%) were given [405]2 Hammond and co-workers reviewed 20,762 cases of VTE after major surgery and found cystectomy patients to have the second-highest rate of VTE among all cancers studied [406]. These patients benefit from 30 days low-molecular-weight heparin prophylaxis. Subsequently, it was demonstrated that BMI > 30 and non-urothelial BCs are independently associated with VTE after cystectomy. In these patients extended (90 days) heparin prophylaxis should be considered [406].
