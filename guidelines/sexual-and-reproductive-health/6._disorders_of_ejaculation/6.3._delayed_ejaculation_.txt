6.3. Delayed Ejaculation (DE). 6.3.1. Definition and classification The American Psychiatric Association defines DE as requiring one of two symptoms; marked delay, infrequency or absence of ejaculation on 75-100% of occasions that persists for at least 6 months and causes personal distress [207]. However, in a recent study, while ejaculatory latency and control were significant criteria to differentiate men with DE from those without ejaculatory disorders, bother/distress did not emerge as a significant factor [729]. Similar to PE, there are distinctions among lifelong, acquired and situational DE [207]. A study demonstrated that men with lifelong DE are younger, report greater DE symptomatology, are less likely to have a medical issue or medication that can cause DE and are more likely to masturbate for anxiety/distress reduction than for pleasure as compared with men with acquired delayed ejaculation [730]. Although the evidence is limited, the prevalence of lifelong and acquired DE is estimated at around 1% and 4%, respectively [208]. 6.3.2. Pathophysiology and risk factors The aetiology of DE can be psychological, organic (e.g., incomplete spinal cord lesion or iatrogenic penile nerve damage), or pharmacological (e.g., SSRIs, antihypertensive drugs, or antipsychotics) [731,732] (Table 18). Other factors that may play a role in the aetiology of DE include tactile sensitivity and tissue atrophy [632]. Although low testosterone level has been considered a risk factor in the past [573,733], more contemporary studies have not confirmed any association between ejaculation times and serum testosterone levels [734,735]. Idiosyncratic masturbation and lack of desire for stimuli are also proposed risk factors for DE [736-738].

Investigation and treatment Patients should have a full medical and sexual history performed along with a detailed physical examination when evaluating for DE. Understanding the details of the ejaculatory response, sensation, frequency, and sexual activity/techniques; cultural context and history of the disorder; quality of the sexual response cycle (desire, arousal, ejaculation, orgasm, and refractory period); partner’s assessment of the disorder and if the partner suffers from any sexual dysfunction her/himself; and the overall satisfaction of the sexual relationship are all important to garner during history-taking [602]. It is incumbent on the clinician to diagnose medical pathologies that cause or contribute to DE, such as assessing the hormonal milieu, anatomy, and overall medical condition. 6.3.3.1. Psychological aspects and intervention There is scarce literature on the psychological aspects relating to DE, as well as on empirical evidence regarding psychological treatment efficacy. Studies on psychological aspects have revealed that men with DE show a strong need to control their sexual experiences. Delayed ejaculation is associated with difficulties surrendering to sexual pleasure during sex - i.e., the sense of letting go [743] - which denotes a underlying psychological mechanism influencing the reaching of orgasm [744]. As for psychological treatments, these may include, but are not limited to: increased genital-specific stimulation; sexual education; role-playing on his own and in front of his partner; retraining masturbatory practices; anxiety reduction on ejaculation and performance; and, re-calibrating the mismatch of sexual fantasies with arousal (such as with pornography use and fantasy stimulation compared to reality). Masturbation techniques that are either solo or partnered can be considered practice for the “real performance”, which can eventually result in greater psychosexual arousal and orgasm for both parties [738]. Although masturbation with fantasy can be harmful when not associated with appropriate sexual arousal and context, fantasy can be supportive if it allows blockage of critical thoughts that may prevent orgasm and ejaculation. Techniques geared towards reducing anxiety are important skills that can help overcome performance anxiety, as this can often interrupt the natural erectile function through orgasmic progression. Referral to a sexual therapist, psychologist or psychiatrist is appropriate and often warranted. 6.3.3.2. Pharmacotherapy Several pharmacological agents, including cabergoline, bupropion, alpha-1-adrenergic agonists (pseudoephedrine, midodrine, imipramine and ephedrine), buspirone, oxytocin, testosterone, bethanechol, yohimbine, amantadine, cyproheptadine and apomorphine have been used to treat DE with varied success [632]. Unfortunately, there is no FDA or EMA-approved medications to treat DE, as most of the cited research is based on case-cohort studies that were not randomised, blinded, or placebo-controlled. Many drugs have been used as primary treatments and/or antidotes to other medications that can cause DE. A survey of sexual health providers demonstrated an overall treatment success of 40% with most providers commonly using cabergoline, bupropion or oxytocin [745]. However, this survey measured the anecdotal results of practitioners. There was no proven efficacy or superiority of any drug due to a lack of placebo-controlled, randomised, blinded, comparative trials [739]. In addition to pharmacotherapy, penile vibratory stimulation (PVS) is also used as an adjunct therapy for DE [746]. Another study that used combined therapy of midodrine and PVS to increase autonomic stimulation in 158 men with spinal cord injury led to ejaculation in almost 65% of the patients [747]. Summary of evidenceLEDelayed ejaculation can be caused by several aetiologies including congenital, anatomic, neurogenic, infective, hormonal, drug-related and psychological.3There is not enough evidence to support a definitive treatment for DE.3
