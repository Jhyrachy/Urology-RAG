8.1. Treatment of strictures in trans men. In trans men, stricture treatment depends on the time after neophallic reconstruction, stricture location, stricture length and quality of local tissues tissues [147,494]. 8.1.1. Management of strictures early after neophallic reconstruction Urethral surgery on tissues in the acute phase urethra has been stabilised. This usually takes six months [495]. Endoscopic incision for short (< 3 cm) urethral strictures has been performed, mainly at the anastomotic site, with a maximum stricture-free rate of only 16.7% when performed within six months after neophallic reconstruction [496]. Insertion of a suprapubic catheter is the first-line treatment in cases of obstructive symptoms severely affecting the patientâ€™s QoL, recurrent UTI or retention. The alternative is perineostomy, which is a specialist procedure and should be performed by a urologist familiar with transgender urethral anatomy. The perineostomy may be closed at the time of formal urethral reconstruction [497]. 8.1.2. Treatment of meatal stenosis in trans men Intermittent urethral dilatation is an option as palliative treatment for low-grade meatal stenosis [31]. Patients with high-grade meatal stenosis, those who refuse ISD, or those who want a durable solution should be offered simple meatotomy. Patency rates are 50% and 75% for transmasculine after respectively metoidioplasty and phalloplasty [147]. The drawback is that the meatus will be in a hypospadiac position. Alternatively, a staged urethroplasty can be offered [147]. 8.1.3. Treatment of strictures at the neophallic urethra The standard treatment for these strictures is staged urethroplasty with or without graft augmentation (BMG or full thickness SG). A patency rate of 50-88% [147,495,498] has been reported after phalloplasty and up to 100% after metoidioplasty [147,495]. For complex (e.g., fully obliterated) or recurrent strictures at the neophallic urethra, a complete urethral substitution with a tubularised radial forearm free flap has been proposed with a 67% patency rate [147]. 8.1.4. Treatment of strictures at the anastomosis neophallic urethra-fixed part of the urethra Short, non-obliterative, strictures can be treated by endoscopic incision. A first endoscopic incision has a 37-45.5% patency rate, but this dropped to 0% in case of three or more attempts (median follow-up of51 months) [495,496]. Therefore, repetitive endoscopic incisions should be discouraged unless with palliative intent. For very short (< 1.5 cm) low-grade strictures, Heineke-Mikulicz urethroplasty is an option reporting a 58-80% after phalloplasty and up to 100% after metoidioplasty [147,495]. If the stricture is nearly or completely obliterative, options are EPA, graft augmentation urethroplasty or staged urethroplasty. Excision and primary anastomosis yields a patency rate of 46-57% after phalloplasty and 78% after metoidioplasty [147,495]. Alternatively or if EPA is not possible (stricture length >2 cm), a graft augmentation urethroplasty can be performed with a 56-100% patency rate [147,495]. In case of insufficient ventral tissue during graft urethroplasty, it is advised to support this graft by a local fasciocutaneous flap [147]. An alternative (especially after failure of the previous techniques) can be a staged approach [147,495]. 8.1.5. Treatment of strictures at the fixed part of the urethra This part of the urethra has a more reliable blood supply, and the dorsal part of the urethra is supported by the corporal bodies of the clitoris. Therefore, single-stage dorsal inlay graft urethroplasty is possible for strictures at this site, especially after metoidioplasty, with up to 100% patency rate [495]. Staged repair with or without a dorsal graft is an alternative for these rare strictures [495]. 8.1.6. Definitive perineostomy in trans men Definitive perineostomy should be offered to patients with refractory strictures or to those with strictures who do not wish to have complex reconstructive surgery [147,495].
