7.7.9. Summary of evidence and recommendations for metastatic disease. Summary of evidenceLEEnfortumab vedotin in combination with pembrolizumab in the first-line setting demonstrated significant survival benefit as compared to chemotherapy.1The combination of cisplatin and gemcitabine plus Nivolumab in the first-line setting demonstrated significant survival benefit as compared to chemotherapy alone.1bIn a first-line setting, PS and the presence or absence of visceral metastases are independent prognostic factors for survival.1bIn a second-line setting, negative prognostic factors are: liver metastasis, PS ≥ 1 and low haemoglobin (< 10 g/dL).1bCisplatin-containing combination chemotherapy can achieve median survival of up to 14 months, with long-term DFS reported in ~15% of patients with nodal disease and good PS.1bSingle-agent chemotherapy provides low response rates of usually short duration.2aCarboplatin combination chemotherapy is less effective than cisplatin-based chemotherapy in terms of complete response and survival.2aThere is no defined standard therapy for platinum chemotherapy-unfit patients with advanced or metastatic UC.2bPost-chemotherapy surgery after partial or complete response may contribute to long-term DFS in highly selected patients.3Zoledronic acid and denosumab have been approved for supportive treatment in case of bone metastases of all cancer types including UC, as they reduce and delay skeletal related events.1bPD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab has been approved for patients that have progressed during or after previous platinum-based chemotherapy based on the results of a phase III trial.1bEnfortumab vedotin after prior platinum chemotherapy and checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy has demonstrated a significant survival benefit as compared to chemotherapy.1bPD-1 inhibitor atezolizumab is approved for patients with advanced or metastatic UC unfit for cisplatin-based chemotherapy in case of high PD-L1 expression defined as tumour-infiltrating immune cells covering ≥ 5% of the tumour area using the SP142 assay.1bPD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab is approved for patients with advanced or metastatic UC unfit for any platinum-based chemotherapy in case of high PD-L1 expression defined as CPS of ≥ 10 using the Dako 22C33 platform (EMA; FDA approval independent of PD-L1 status).1bThe combination of chemotherapy plus pembrolizumab or atezolizumab and the combination of durvalumab and tremelimumab have not demonstrated OS survival benefit compared to platinum-based chemotherapy alone.1bSwitch maintenance with the PD-L1 inhibitor avelumab has demonstrated significant OS benefit in patients achieving at least stable disease on first-line platinum-based chemotherapy.1b RecommendationsStrength ratingFirst-line treatment if eligible for combination therapyUse antibody drug conjugate enfortumab vedotin (EV) in combination with checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) pembrolizumab.StrongIf contraindications for EV or EV not available:Offer platinum-containing combination chemotherapy (cisplatin or carboplatin plus gemcitabine) followed by maintenance treatment with CPI avelumab in patients with at least stable disease on chemotherapy.StrongIf contraindications for EV (or EV not available) and cisplatin-eligible:Consider cisplatin/gemcitabine in combination with CPI nivolumab.StrongIf contraindications for checkpoint inhibitor therapy:Use platinum-containing combination chemotherapy (Cisplatin or carboplatin plus gemcitabine).StrongFirst-line treatment if not eligible for combination therapyConsider single agent CPI pembrolizumab or atezolizumab in case of high PD-1 expression. (for definitions see text).WeakSecond-line treatmentAfter prior EV + CPIOffer platinum-containing combination chemotherapy (cisplatin or carboplatin plus gemcitabine).WeakIf actionable FGFR alterations: offer erdafitinib.WeakConsider antibody drug conjugate sacituzumab govitecan.WeakConsider single agent chemotherapy (docetaxel, paclitaxel, vinflunine).WeakAfter prior platinum-based chemotherapy +/- CPIOffer antibody drug conjugate enfortumab vedotin.StrongIf actionable FGFR alterations: offer erdafitinib.StrongIf no prior CPI: offer pembrolizumab.StrongConsider antibody drug conjugate sacituzumab govitecan.WeakConsider single agent chemotherapy (docetaxel, paclitaxel, vinflunine).WeakFurther treatment after EV, CPI, platinum-based therapyGeneral statement: Offer treatment in clinical trials. Consider best supportive care (BSC) alone if patient is not a candidate for further cancer-specific systemic therapy.StrongIf actionable FGFR alterations: offer Erdafitinib.Weak BSC = best supportive care; CPI = checkpoint inhibitor; EV = enfortumab vedotin; GC = gemcitabine plus cisplatin; FGFR = fibroblast growth factor receptor Figure 7.2: Flow chart for the management of metastatic urothelial cancer**EV = enfortumab vedotin; FGFR = fibroblast growth factor receptor; GFR = glomerular filtration rate; PS = performance status; CPI=checkpoint inhibitor; PD-L1= programmed deathligand 1; PD= programmed death
