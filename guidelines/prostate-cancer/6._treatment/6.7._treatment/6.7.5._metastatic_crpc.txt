6.7.5. Metastatic CRPC. The remainder of this section focuses on the management of men with proven mCRPC on conventional imaging. 6.7.5.1. Conventional androgen deprivation in CRPC Eventually men with PCa will show evidence of disease progression despite castration. Two trials have shown only a marginal survival benefit for patients remaining on LHRH analogues during second- and thirdline therapies [1175,1176]. However, in the absence of prospective data, the modest potential benefits of continuing castration outweigh the minimal risk of treatment. In addition, all subsequent treatments have been studied in men with ongoing androgen suppression, therefore, it should be continued in these patients.
