3.16.2.6. Midurethral slings. One systematic review and meta-analysis identified one study assessing the role of pre-operative antibiotics for midurethral sling surgery alone [551]. The study was halted due to low rate of infectious outcomes seen at the first scheduled interim analysis. The study enrolled 29 women in the antibiotic prophylaxis (cefazolin) group and 30 in the placebo group with a total follow-up of six months. No statistically significant difference between the cefazolin and placebo groups, with respect to wound infections [1 (3.3%) and 0 (0%)] or bacteriuria [3 (10%) and 1 (3.5%)] was found [551].
