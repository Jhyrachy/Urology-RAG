6.3.1.6. Distal urethral strictures (meatal stenosis, fossa navicularis strictures). Open repair of distal urethral strictures can be in the form of Malone meatoplasty, skin flap meatoplasty or graft (skin [SG]/OMG) urethroplasty. For short distal meatal strictures, the Malone meatoplasty (dorsal + ventral meatotomy) provides a technique with patency rates up to 100%, and 83% patient-reported satisfaction with the cosmetic results [308]. Similarly, Hofer et al., presented their technique variation (ventral excision of scar and eversion of the urethral mucosa) and showed 81% stricture-free rates at 41-month mean follow-up. Skin flap meatoplasty showed excellent patency rates ranging from 90-96% based on three studies comprising 67 patients [309-311]. In addition, based on their results, patient satisfaction with post-operative outcomes and cosmesis was high, there were no cases of ED and functional complaints were minimal (mainly spraying of the urine flow). Patency rates with the use of grafts (OMG or SG) ranged from 69-91% in 106 patients overall [312,313,300]. Where reported, patients were satisfied with cosmesis, and mild spraying of the urine flow self-resolved. Although tubularised grafts in a single-stage procedures are not routinely recommended (see also section 9. Tissue transfer), one series reported an 89.9% patency rate for this approach (“two-in one approach”) in selected patients with mainly distal penile strictures [314]. Finally, Daneshvar et al., presented a novel transurethral ventral inlay OMG technique and showed excellent stricture-free rates (96%) at short follow-up though (median 16 months). For further information see supplementary Table S6.4. Summary of evidenceLEPost-meatoplasty/urethroplasty patency rates in men with meatal stenosis or fossa navicularis/distal urethral strictures range between 57-100% depending on type of surgical intervention with high patient satisfaction and minimal complications.3 RecommendationStrength ratingOffer open meatoplasty or distal urethroplasty to patients with meatal stenosis or fossa navicularis/distal urethral strictures.Weak
