6.4.5.1.2.2. Salvage radiotherapy with or without ADT (cTx cN0/1) with PET/CT. In a prospective multi-centre study of 323 patients with BCR, PSMA PET/CT changed the management intent in 62% of patients as compared to conventional staging. This was due to a significant reduction in the number of men in whom the site of disease recurrence was unknown (77% vs. 19%, p < 0.001) and a significant increase in the number of men with metastatic disease (11% vs. 57%) [986]. A prospective study in a subgroup of 119 BCR patients with low PSA (< 0.5 ng/mL) reported a change in the intended treatment in 30.2% of patients [868]; however, no data exist on the impact on final outcome. Another prospective study in 272 patients with early biochemical recurrent PCa after RP showed that 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT may tailor further therapy decisions (e.g., local vs. systemic treatment) at low PSA values (0.2–1 ng/mL) [870]. A single-centre study retrospectively assessed 164 men who underwent imaging with PSMA PET/CT for a rising PSA after RP with PSA levels < 0.5 ng/mL. In men with a negative PSMA PET/CT who received SRT, 85% (23 out of 27) demonstrated a treatment response compared to a further PSA increase in 65% of those not treated (22 out of 34). In the 36/99 men with disease confined to the prostate fossa on PSMA, 83% (29 out of 36) responded to SRT [987]. Thus, PSMA PET/CT might stratify men into a group with high response (negative findings or recurrence confined to the prostate) and poor response (positive nodes or distant disease) to SRT. A multi-centre retrospective study evaluated patients who underwent SRT for BCR after RP, without any signs of distant metastatic disease on PET/CT. After case-controle matching, two cohorts (n = 108 patients each), with and without PSMA PET/CT prior to SRT were analysed. In the cohort without PSMA PET/CT, 23 patients (21%) had BCR at one year after SRT vs. nine patients (8%) who underwent restaging with PSMA PET/C prior to SRT (p = 0.007). PSMA-PET/CT was found to be associated with an improved oncological outcome in patients with BCR after RP, receiving SRT to the prostatic fossa [988]. It is worth mentioning that in this study the median biologically effective radiation dose administered in the PSMA-cohort was significantly higher than in the historical cohort (70 Gy vs. 66 Gy, respectively, p < 0.001). However, in the SAKK 09/10 randomised phase-III-trial (all patients without PET-CT before SRT) the biochemical progression rate after SRT between patients who underwent 64 Gy or 70 Gy to the prostate bed, without HT for BCR, did not differ significantly [980]. Therefore, it is questionable whether this difference in administered radiation dose influenced the outcome in both cohorts. As there are no prospective phase III data including PET-CT before SRT (in particular not for PCa-specific survival or OS) these results have to be confirmed before a recommendation can be provided. A single-centre open-label, phase II/III RCT (EMPIRE-1) evaluated the role of 18F-fluciclovine-PET/CT compared with conventional imaging for SRT. Three hundred and sixty five patients with detectable PSA after RP but negative results on conventional imaging, were randomised to RT directed by conventional imaging alone or to conventional imaging plus PET/CT; patients with M1 disease in the PET/CT group (n = 4) were excluded. Patients with cN1 were irradiated to the pelvic lymphatics but without a boost to the metastasis. Median follow 103 up was 3.5 years. In adjusted analyses, the study group was significantly associated with event-free survival (HR: 2.04, 95% CI: 1.06–3.93, p = 0.0327) [948].
