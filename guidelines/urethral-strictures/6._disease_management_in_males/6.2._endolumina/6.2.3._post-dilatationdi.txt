6.2.3. Post-dilatation/direct vision internal urethrotomy strategies. Several strategies have been developed and evaluated to prevent wound contraction, improve the stricture-free rate and time to stricture recurrence after dilatation or DVIU. It is noteworthy that these strategies tend to stabilise the stricture rather than to keep the patient stricture-free and the reported outcomes should be understood in this respect. 6.2.3.1. Intermittent self-dilatation 6.2.3.1.1. Results A SR identified six randomised and quasi-randomised trials comparing intermittent self-dilatation (ISD) with no ISD with a follow-up between eight and 24 months [227]. Stricture recurrence was reduced in men performing ISD (85/197, 43%) vs. those who did not (128/207, 62%) (RR: 0.70; 95% CI: 0.48-1.00; p=0.05). There was significant heterogeneity, and the quality of included studies were very low, which led the authors to conclude there is uncertainty about the estimate [227]. This review found no significant difference in adverse events between ISD and no ISD (RR: 0.60; 95% CI: 0.11-3.26; p=0.56) [227]. One trial containing 48 patients found no significant difference in six vs. twelve months duration of ISD (RR: 0.67; 95% CI: 0.12-3.64) and another trial (n=59) found no significant difference from using a low-friction hydrophylic vs. a polyvinyl chloride catheter (RR: 0.32; 95% CI: 0.07-1.40) [227]. Other studies have been published after this SR of 2014. Chhabra et al., reported that patients complying with ISD after dilatation had a lower need for re-intervention than those who did not, 12.3% vs. 20.5% respectively (p=0.2) [228]. After a mean follow-up of 25 months, Greenwell et al., found a need for subsequent intervention in 13/31 (42%) men performing ISD vs. 47/95 (49%) who did not (p=0.46). The number of reoperations in patients with need for subsequent intervention was lower in the group performing ISD vs. those who did not (2.6 vs. 3.4). No major complications were reported in both groups [229]. 6.2.3.1.2. Complications The potential benefit of ISD in stabilising the stricture must be balanced against the drawbacks. Commonly reported complications are urethral bleeding (7.1%) [230] and UTI/epididymitis (4.7-18.1%) [231,232]. A multicentric prospective study (n=85) reported that respectively 35% and 26% of patients had moderate to severe difficulties in catheterisation and respectively 32% and 17% of patients suffered moderate to severe pain while performing ISD. This had a serious impact on QoL which was rated moderate and poor in 32% and 55% of patients, respectively [33]. Younger age was identified as predictor for poor QoL, and QoL was more impaired in proximal stricture location (posterior and bulbar) [33]. In a study of 286 patients (mainly > 60 years old) performing ISD, 20% experienced problems with ISD and 33% had at least one infection annually. After a mean follow-up of 58 months 67% still continued with ISD [233]. Khan et al., reported eight “drop-outs” of 30 (26.7%) men randomised to ISD [232]. Of these eight “drop-outs”, two were unable to perform ISD and one stopped because of pain. As mentioned above, repetitive dilatation (including ISD) increases stricture complexity and delays time to urethroplasty [222,234]. 6.2.3.1.3. Intermittent self-dilatation combined with intra-urethral corticosteroids To delay wound contraction at the stricture site, intra-urethral corticosteroids (as a catheter lubricant) have been used to improve the results of ISD. In 2014, a SR identified three prospective RCTs comparing ISD and local steroid (triamcinolone) ointment vs. ISD without local steroid ointment [235]. These three studies included a total 67 and 68 patients randomised to local steroid, or not, with a follow-up ranging between twelve and 36 months. There were fifteen (22.4%) recurrences in the steroid group and 25 (36.7%) in the control group (OR: 0.51; 95% CI: 0.24-1.10; p=0.09) [235]. Time to recurrence was longer in the steroid group vs. the control group (weighted mean difference = 0.29; 95% CI: 0.08-1.00; p=0.05). There was no difference in adverse events between groups [235]. Since 2014, two additional RCTs have been published. Ergun et al., evaluated patients after DVIU for primary short (< 2 cm), bulbar (82%) or posterior (18%) strictures that were further randomised between ISD (n=30) and ISD + triamcinolone ointment (n=30) for six weeks. Stricture recurrence rate after 24 months was not significantly different between ISD and ISD + triamcinolone (respectively 33.3 and 30%) [236]. On the other hand, Regmi et al., found a lower stricture recurrence rate (22% vs. 46%, p=0.04) in patients performing ISD + triamcinolone (n=27) vs. ISD alone (n=28) [237]. In this study, median time to recurrence was 7.4 ± 4.5 months vs. 11.9 ± 3 months in respectively ISD alone and ISD + triamcinolone (p=0.16). Both studies reported no complications related to ointment of triamcinolone [236,237]. In a small (n=28) cohort with LS-related strictures, an intra-urethral steroid regimen was successful (no need for subsequent escalation of therapy) in 25 (89%) patients after a mean follow-up of 25 months [157]. This regimen consisted of applying clobetasol cream 0.05% as lubricant on a calibration device (10-16 Fr catheter or dilator) twice a day during a minimum of two months. As most of these patients further continued with instillation of steroids on a calibration device, this high “success” rate must be viewed with caution and should be considered as a stabilisation of the stricture rather than a cure. Eventually, twelve (42.8%) patients could reduce the interval of instillation/dilatation and three (10.7%) of them could finally stop the treatment [157]. Summary of evidenceLEStricture recurrence was reduced in men performing intermittent self-dilatation (ISD) versus those who did not.1aIntra-urethral corticosteroids in addition to ISD delays the time to recurrence.1a RecommendationsStrength ratingPerform intermittent self-dilatation (ISD) to stabilise the stricture after dilatation/direct vision internal urethrotomy if urethroplasty is not a viable option.WeakUse intra-urethral corticosteroids in addition to ISD to stabilise the urethral stricture.Weak 6.2.3.2. Intralesional injections The rationale of adjuvant intralesional injections is to reduce fibroblast proliferation and excessive urethral scaring [238]. 6.2.3.2.1. Steroids A 2014 SR identified five studies comparing intra-urethral submucosal steroid injection vs. no intra-urethral submucosal steroid injection after DVIU, of which two were RCTs [235]. Meta-analysis of these two RCTs with 57 and 58 patients in, respectively, the steroid and control group showed no statistical difference in recurrence rate (OR: 0.53; 95% CI: 0.25-1.13; p=0.10). Time to recurrence was significantly longer in the steroid group (weighted mean difference = 4.43; 95% CI: 2.77–6.09, p < 0.00001). There were no significant differences regarding adverse events (infection, bleeding, extravasation) between both groups (weighted mean difference = 1.59; 95% CI: 0.71–3.58, p=0.26). 6.2.3.2.2. Mitomycin C In 2021 a SR and meta-analysis of different adjuncts to minimally invasive treatment of urethral stricture in men, mitomycin C (MMC) was associated with the lowest rate of urethral stricture recurrence (intralesional injection: OR 0.23, 95% CI 0.11-0.48; P<0.001; intraluminal injection: OR 0.11, 95% CI 0.02-0.61; P=0.01) [239]. Another SR and meta-analysis in 2021 from Xu et al., on the efficacy of MMC combined with direct vision internal urethrotomy, revealed that the effect of MMC was significant in short (< 2cm), anterior urethral strictures, in the longer (>12 months) follow-up group [240]. In the absence of well-conducted and adequately powered RCTs along with the lack of standardisation (dose, technique, volume, etc.) in the current literature, careful clinical review and prospective data collection as part of a clinical trial is advised. 6.2.3.2.3. Platelet rich plasma Rezaei et al., conducted an RCT comparing DVIU + platelet rich plasma (PRP) (n=44) vs. DVIU + saline (n=43) in primary, bulbar strictures < 1.5 cm in length [241]. The two-year stricture-free rate was 78% vs. 56% after DVIU with or without PRP, respectively (p=0.034). Complications were frequent but not significantly different between both groups (DVIU + PRP: 70%; DVIU + saline: 79%). All complications (urethral bleeding, haematuria, urethral pain, pelvic pain, urinary leakage and genitoperineal swelling) were classified as grade 1 according to the Clavien-Dindo system. Further validation of this treatment is needed before general clinical implementation. Summary of evidenceLEIntralesional injections after direct vision internal urethrotomy (DVIU) might improve stricture-freerates on the short-term compared to DVIU alone. Experience is limited and the use of these drugs are off-label. Significant uncertainty exists about drug, dose, volume and technique.1a RecommendationStrength ratingUse intralesional injections only in the confines of a clinical trial.Weak 6.2.3.3. Urethral stents Urethral stents are designed with the aim to oppose wound contraction after dilatation or DVIU [242,243]. Stent insertion is a short procedure (< 60 minutes) that can be done under local or spinal anaesthesia as “one day” surgery [242,244,245]. Urethral stents are classified as permanent or temporary (removable, after six to twelve months). 6.2.3.3.1. Results Permanent stainless-steel mesh stents are no longer commercially available. An RCT comparing dilatation/DVIU only vs. dilatation/DVIU followed by temporary stent insertion for bulbar strictures reported a significantly longer stricture-free survival time in favour of dilation/DVIU followed by stent (median 292 vs. 84 days; p < 0.001) [246]. Only 20.6% of patients treated with a stent developed a recurrent stricture within one year vs. 82.8% in the control group. These results are corroborated by a prospective series of Wong et al., who found a median stricture-free survival of two months after DVIU alone vs. 23 months after DVIU followed by temporary (three months) stent for bulbar strictures [243]. Failure and need for re-intervention are frequent (30-53%) and are usually because of stricture recurrence, stent encrustation, stent migration and urethral hyperplasia. Other complications include recurrent UTI, recurrent haematuria and genito-perineal pain (Table 6.5). Although stents are mainly used to treat bulbar strictures, they have been used for posterior stenoses as well. Stents used in the posterior urethra have a high risk (82-100%) of causing UI and this is most pronounced in patients with previous irradiation and/or strictures extending into the membranous or bulbar urethra [247]. In the bulbar urethra, the risk of UI is higher if stent placement is adjacent to the external sphincter [248]. The use of stents in the penile urethra is anecdotal. Jung et al., reported stent failure in 4/7 (57%) patients with a penile stricture after a mean follow-up of eight months. Of those patients who failed, no patient with distal or pan-penile strictures was rendered stricture-free [249]. In their series, stricture recurrence after stenting of the penile urethra was significantly higher when compared to the bulbar urethra [249]. Although no direct comparison is available, temporary stents tend to have fewer and less severe complications compared to permanent stents (Table 6.7). 6.2.3.4. Drug-coated balloon dilatation Drug (paclitaxel)-coated balloon dilatation (DCBD) after standard dilatation or DVIU aims to reduce scar formation based on its antimitotic action. The ROBUST-3 trial prospectively randomized patients with predominantly bulbar strictures (< 3cm length) and at least two prior failed endoscopic treatments to DCBD (n=79) or standard dilatation/DVIU (n=48) [250]. Anatomic patency (assessed by cystoscopy) at six months was 75% for DCBD versus 27% after standard dilatation/DVIU (p<0.001). Estimated one year-retreatment free survival was 83% versus 22% for respectively DCBD and standard dilatation/DVIU (p<0.001). There were no serious adverse events related to DCBD although patients undergoing DCBD had a higher rate of hematuria and dysuria compared to controls (11.4% versus 2.1%). Paclitaxel was detected in semen up to six months after treatment which urges for contraception if the partner has child-bearing potential. If used, careful clinical review and prospective data collection ideally part of a post marketing registry or clinical trial is advised. Summary of evidenceLEDrug (paclitaxel)-coated balloon dilatation is associated with higher anatomic patency rates (at sixmonths) and lower risk of retreatment (at one year) as compared to standard dilatation/DVIU in patients with short (< 3 cm), bulbar strictures that underwent at least two prior failed endoscopic treatments.1b RecommendationStrength ratingOffer drug (paclitaxel)-coated balloon dilatation for a short (< 3 cm) bulbar stricture recurring after at least two prior endoscopic treatments, but only in patients for whom urethroplasty is not an option.Weak 6.2.3.4.1. Treatment of stent failure In the case of stent failure, subsequent urethroplasty (usually with stent removal) is possible, but this urethroplasty is very likely to be more complex than it would have been had it been performed initially [251-253]. Due to the fact that the stainless-steel wires are fully embedded into the urethral wall, over time the urethral spongiosum is severely damaged. Horiguchi et al., found that a history of urethral stenting was an independent significant predictor of increased stricture complexity (OR: 13.7; 95% CI: 1.7-318.3; p=0.01) and need for more complex urethroplasty (OR: 6.9; 95% CI: 1.1-64.5; p=0.04) [234]. The majority (62%) of patients in this study had a permanent stent and tend to be difficult to remove because they are epithelialised, usually within six months [234]. The type of urethroplasty required depends on the length of the stricture and quality of local tissues [252]. In the majority of cases, it is possible to preserve the urethral plate and to perform a one-stage substitution urethroplasty [251,252,254]. The patency rates after different types of urethroplasty vary greatly between 16.7-100% [251-254] and this variation probably reflects variation in complexity of the stricture, rather than that the superiority of one technique of urethroplasty over another (for further information see supplementary Table S6.2). Due to these limitations, the use of stents should be avoided if subsequent urethroplasty is considered [242,253]. Urethral stents are not a first-line treatment for urethral strictures but can be considered in co-morbid patients who have a recurrent stricture after DVIU/dilatation and are unable to have more complex urethroplasty or who refuse urethroplasty [242,246,247]. Summary of evidenceLEPermanent urethral stents have a high complications and failure rate and make subsequent urethroplasty more challenging if they fail.3Stents have a higher failure rate in the penile urethra.3Temporary stents after DVIU (direct vision internal urethrotomy) /dilatation at the bulbar urethra prolong time to next recurrence compared to DVIU/dilatation alone.1b RecommendationsStrength ratingDo not use permanent urethral stents.StrongDo not use urethral stents for penile strictures.StrongUse a temporary stent for recurrent bulbar strictures after direct vision internal urethrotomy to prolong time to next recurrence only if urethroplasty is not a viable option.Weak
