3.4. Summary of evidence and recommendations: CPPPS and mechanisms. Summary of evidenceLECPPPS mechanisms are well defined and involve mechanisms of neuroplasticity and neuropathic pain.2The mechanisms of neuroplasticity and neuropathic pain result in increased perception of afferent stimuli which may produce abnormal sensations as well as pain.1End-organ function can also be altered by the mechanisms of neuroplasticity so that symptoms of function can also occur.1The diagnosis of a CPPPS as a pain syndrome is essential as it encourages a holistic approach to management with multi-specialty and multi-disciplinary care.2 RecommendationsStrength ratingAll of those involved in the management of chronic pelvic pain should have knowledge of peripheral and central pain mechanisms.StrongThe early assessment of patients with chronic pelvic pain should involve investigations aimed at excluding disease-associated pelvic pain.StrongAssess functional, emotional, behavioural, sexual and other quality of life issues, such as effect on work and socialisation, early in patients with chronic pelvic pain and address these issues as well as the pain.StrongBuild up relations with colleagues so as to be able to manage CPPPS comprehensively in a multi-specialty and multi-disciplinary environment with consideration of all their symptoms.Strong
