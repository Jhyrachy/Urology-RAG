6.1.2.6. Glans resurfacing. Besides its established effects in the therapy of PeIN, total or partial glans resurfacing has been reported to be employed for superficially-invasive lesions combined with deeper resection at the site of invasion. The literature is heterogeneous with many studies reporting miscellaneous techniques of organ-sparing surgery including glans resurfacing without specification of tumour invasiveness in these patients specifically. Five studies have reported results of glans resurfacing specifically in invasive penile cancer in a total of 68 patients, with most being pT1 and a few instances of T2 lesions displaying RFR ranging from 75â€“96.6% [143,151,156-158]. Similar to glans resurfacing as applied to carcinoma in situ, graft-related complications are scarce and cosmesis, as assessed by patients, is generally good. Cakir and colleagues have described a small series using a technique for glans resurfacing with preservation of the coronal sulcus for distal tumours not invading the sulcus and show that this option can be considered when aiming for maximally preserved erogenous sensation [143].
