4.5.5. Complications. The possibility of complications from genital trauma, including psychological effects, erectile dysfunction, urethral stricture, and infertility, is high. In patients with a history of penile fracture post-operative complications were reported in up to 20% of cases, development of plaques or nodules following surgery, post-operative curvature formation and erectile dysfunction occur in 13.9%, 2.8% and 1.9% of patients, respectively [302]. Post-surgical erectile dysfunction is more common in patients > 50 years and those with bilateral corporal involvement [365]. Skin necrosis is rare [305]. The tear size of the tunica albuginea is a parameter which may affect long-term follow-up results [366]. Conservative management of penile fracture increases complications, such as penile abscess, missed urethral disruption, penile curvature, and persistent haematoma requiring delayed surgical intervention [367]. Late complications after conservative management were fibrosis and angulations in 35% and impotence in up to 62% [304,368]. Post-operative complications were reported in 8% of patients who underwent testicular repair after penetrating trauma [310]. Despite good management and regular follow-up of external genital gunshot wounds, such wounds are fraught with the possibility of complications such as erectile dysfunction, urethral stricture, and infertility. Delayed complications include chronic pain and testicular atrophy. Haematoceles initially treated non-operatively may eventually need delayed surgery if they develop infection or undue pain. Genital injuries are rarely life threatening, but fertility and testosterone production often become the male trauma patientâ€™s chief concern once acute issues are resolved [369].
