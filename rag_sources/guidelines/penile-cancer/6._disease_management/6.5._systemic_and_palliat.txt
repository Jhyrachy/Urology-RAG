6.5.2.1. immunotherapy immune-based therapies immune-checkpoint blockade, hpv-directed vaccines adoptive t-cell therapies emerged potential treatment options advanced penile cancer . given relatively high expression pd-l1 penile scc, several trials progress assess checkpoint inhibition advanced disease. none anti-pd(l)1 monotherapy trials published thus far. trials presented conferences reported

one partial response (pr) 2 stable diseases (sd) reported . another study testing combination ipilimumab nivolumab, 5 penile scc included reporting 2 patients sd . general, inclusion patients advanced
