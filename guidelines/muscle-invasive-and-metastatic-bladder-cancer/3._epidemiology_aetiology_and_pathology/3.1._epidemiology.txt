3.1. Epidemiology. Bladder cancer is the 7th most commonly diagnosed cancer in males, whilst it drops to 10th position when both genders are considered [7]. The worldwide age-standardised incidence rate (per 100,000 person/years) is 9.5 for men and 2.4 for women [7]. In the European Union, the age-standardised incidence rate is 20 for men and 4.6 for women [7]. In Europe, the highest age-standardised incidence rate has been reported in Belgium (31 in men and 6.2 in women) and the lowest in Finland (18.1 in men and 4.3 in women) [7]. Worldwide, the BC age-standardised mortality rate (per 100,000 person/years) was 3.3 for men vs. 0.86 for women in 2012 [7]. Bladder cancer incidence and mortality rates vary across countries due to differences in risk factors, detection and diagnostic practices, and availability of treatments. The variations are, however, also partly caused by the different methodologies used in the studies and the quality of data collection [8,9]. The incidence and mortality of BC has decreased in some registries, possibly reflecting the decreased impact of causative agents [10,11]. Approximately 75% of patients with BC present with disease confined to the mucosa (stage Ta, carcinoma in situ [CIS]) or submucosa (stage T1). In younger patients (< 40 years) this percentage is even higher [12]. Patients with TaT1 and CIS have a high prevalence due to long-term survival in many cases and lower risk of cancer-specific mortality (CSM) compared to T2-4 tumours [7,8].
