4.2. Anatomic classification systems. Objective anatomic classification systems, such as the Preoperative Aspects and Dimensions Used for an Anatomical (PADUA) classification system, the R.E.N.A.L. nephrometry score, the C-index, an Arterial Based Complexity (ABC) Scoring System and Zonal NePhRO scoring system, have been proposed to standardise the description of renal tumours [95-97]. These systems include assessment of tumour size, exophytic/endophytic properties, proximity to the collecting system and renal sinus, and anterior/posterior or lower/upper pole location. The use of such a system is helpful as it allows objective prediction of potential morbidity of NSS and tumour ablation techniques. These tools provide information for treatment planning, patient counselling, and comparison of PN and tumour ablation series. However, when selecting the most optimal treatment option, anatomic scores must be considered together with patient features and surgeon experience.
