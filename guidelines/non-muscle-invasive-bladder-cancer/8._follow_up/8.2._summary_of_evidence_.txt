8.2. Summary of evidence and recommendations for follow-up of patients after transurethral resection of the bladder for non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer. Summary of evidenceLEThe first cystoscopy after transurethral resection of the bladder at 3 months is an important prognostic indicator for recurrence and progression.1aThe risk of upper urinary tract recurrence increases in patients with multiple- and high-risk tumours.3 RecommendationsStrength ratingBase follow-up of TaT1 tumours and carcinoma in situ (CIS) on regular cystoscopy.StrongPatients with low-risk Ta tumours should undergo cystoscopy at three months. If negative, subsequent cystoscopy is advised nine months later, and then yearly for five years.WeakPatients with high-risk and those with very high-risk tumours treated conservatively should undergo cystoscopy and urinary cytology at three months. If negative, subsequent cystoscopy and cytology should be repeated every three months for a period of two years, and every six months thereafter until five years, and then annually lifelong.WeakPerform cystoscopy at three months for patients with intermediate-risk Ta low-grade tumours. If negative, subsequent cystoscopy can be repeated every six months for two years, and then annually for ten years. The subgroup of intermediate-risk that are high grade should be followed up as high-risk.WeakTake regular and long-term upper tract imaging (computed tomography urography) for high-risk and very high-risk tumours.WeakPerform endoscopy under anaesthesia and bladder biopsies when office cystoscopy shows suspicious findings or if urinary cytology is positive.StrongDuring follow-up in patients with positive cytology and no visible tumour in the bladder, mapping biopsies or PDD-guided biopsies (if equipment is available) and investigation of extravesical locations (CT urography, prostatic urethra biopsy) are recommended.Strong
