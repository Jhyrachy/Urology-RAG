5.3.5. Non-ablative techniques. 5.3.5.1. Prostatic urethral lift Mechanism of action: Prostatic urethral lift (PUL) is a minimally invasive approach under local or general anaesthesia. Encroaching lateral lobes are compressed by small permanent suture-based implants delivered under cystoscopic guidance resulting in an opening of the prostatic urethra leaving a continuous anterior channel through the prostatic fossa. Efficacy: Several reports have shown that PUL achieves a significant improvement in IPSS (-39% to -52%), Qmax (+32% to +59%) and QoL (-48% to -53%) [542-547]. In a meta-analysis of retrospective and prospective trials, pooled estimates showed an overall improvement following PUL, including IPSS, Qmax, and QoL [547]. A Cochrane review of the sham RCT and the RCT against TURP concluded that PUL appears less effective than TURP in improving urological symptoms (IPSS, Qmax) in both short- and long term, while QoL outcomes may be similar [548]. Prostatic urethral lift was evaluated vs. sham in a multicentre study with one [544] three [549] and five [550] years follow-up of the treated cohort. Improvements in IPSS, QoL, and Qmax were durable with improvement rates of 36%, 50%, and 44% at 60-month follow-up, respectively [550]. A network meta-analysis included outcome data at three to six months follow-up and concluded that improvement of IPSS was similarly high after TURP and PUL. Objective outcomes (PVR and Qmax) were improved to the greatest extent after TURP, with less improvement after PUL [540]. A retrospective observational study of 1,413 consecutive patients from North America and Australia split patients into those still voiding (Group A) and those in retention (Group B). The results from Group A were comparable to the results from the clinical trials and of the 165 patients in Group B 69% were catheter free after five days, 83% after one month and 89% by study end [551]. Tolerability and safety: The most common complications reported post-operatively included haematuria (16-63%), dysuria (25-58%), pelvic pain (5-17.9%), urgency (7.1-10%), transient incontinence (3.6-16%), and UTI (2.9-11%) [544,547,549,550]. Most symptoms were mild-to-moderate in severity and resolved within two to four weeks after the procedure. In an RCT comparing PUL to TURP, surgical recovery was measured using a validated instrument. They found that recovery from PUL is more rapid and more extensive in the first three to six months [552]. A SR and meta-analysis found that sexual function with regard to erectile and ejaculatory function remained stable or improved slightly during the 24-month follow-up [547,548,553]. In an RCT comparing PUL to TURP, PUL resulted in superior quality of recovery and ejaculatory function preservation. Ejaculatory function and bother scores did not change significantly in either treatment arm [552]. A SR of surgical re-interventions of eleven studies (2,016 patients), among which TURP/laser (51%), repeat PUL (32.7%) and device explant (19.6%) were most common, revealed an annual rate of surgical re-intervention of 6% per year (95% CI: 3.0-8.9) [554]. The re-treatment rate was 13.6% over five years in a multicentre study comparing PUL vs. sham [550]. Practical considerations: There are only limited data on treating patients with an obstructed/protruding middle lobe [555]. The effectiveness in large prostate glands has not been shown yet. Long-term studies are needed to evaluate the duration of the effect in comparison to other techniques. Summary of evidenceLEProstatic urethral lift improves IPSS, Qmax and QoL; these improvements are inferior to TURP at 24 months.1bProstatic urethral lift has a low incidence of sexual side effects.1bPatients should be informed that long-term effects, including the risk of retreatment, have not been evaluated.4 RecommendationStrength ratingOffer Prostatic urethral lift (Urolift®) to men with LUTS interested in preserving ejaculatory function, with prostates < 70 mL and no middle lobe.Strong 5.3.5.2. Intra-prostatic injections Mechanism of action: Various substances have been injected directly into the prostate in order to improve LUTS including Botulinum toxin-A (BoNT-A), fexapotide triflutate (NX-1207) and PRX302. The primary mechanism of action of BoNT-A is through the inhibition of neurotransmitter release from cholinergic neurons [556]. The mechanisms of action for the injectables NX-1207 and PRX302 are not completely understood, but experimental data suggest apoptosis-induced atrophy of the prostate with both drugs [556]. Efficacy: A SR and meta-analysis showed no differences in efficacy of BoNT-A compared with placebo and concluded that there is no evidence of clinical benefit in medical practice [557]. The positive results from Phase II-studies have not been confirmed in Phase III-trials for PRX302 [558,559]. Fexapotide triflutate (NX-1207) was evaluated in two multicentre placebo controlled double-blind randomised parallel group trials including a total of 995 patients with a mean follow-up of 3.6 years, IPSS change from baseline was significantly higher and AUR rate was significantly reduced in the treatment arm. The authors concluded that NX-1207 is an effective transrectal injectable for long-term treatment for LUTS and that treated patients have reduced need for further intervention [560]. Tolerability and Safety: A SR and meta-analysis showed low incidence rates of procedure-related adverse events [557]. Two multicentre placebo controlled double-blind randomised parallel group trials with long-term follow-up evaluating NX-1207 detected no significant safety differences between the study arms [560]. Practical considerations: Positive results for PRX 302 from Phase II-studies have not been confirmed in Phase III-trials yet. Nevertheless, an RCT evaluating transperineal intraprostatic BoNT-A injection vs. TURP concluded that IPSS significantly decreased in all patients, with a non-significant difference between the arms and that the BoNT-A injection significantly maintained erectile function compared to TURP at twelve months [561]. More high-quality evidence against reference techniques is needed. Summary of evidenceLEResults from clinical trials have shown no clinical benefits for BoNT-A compared to placebo for the management of LUTS due to BPO.1aResults from clinical trials have shown clinical benefits for NX-1207 compared to placebo for the management of LUTS due to BPO.1b RecommendationStrength ratingDo not offer intraprostatic Botulinum toxin-A injection treatment to patients with male LUTS.Strong 5.3.5.3. Non-ablative techniques under investigation 5.3.5.3.1.(i)TIND Mechanism of action: The iTIND is a nitinol device composed of three elongated struts and an anchoring leaflet. Under direct visualisation iTIND is deployed inside the prostate in expanded configuration. The intended mode of action is to compress obstructive tissue by the expanded device, thereby exerting radial force leading to ischaemic necrosis resulting in a Turner Warwick like incision. The iTIND device is left in position for five days and removed in an outpatient setting by standard urethroscopy. Efficacy: A single-arm, prospective study of 32 patients with a three-year follow-up was conducted to evaluate feasibility and safety of the procedure [562]. The change from baseline in IPSS, QoL and Qmax was significant at every follow-up [563]. In a multicenter RCT, 175 men were randomised 2:1 between iTIND and sham procedures. Patients were assessed at baseline, 45 days, three, and twelve months postoperatively. A total of 78.6% of patients in the iTIND arm showed a reduction of ≥ 3 points in IPSS, vs. 60% of patients in the control arm at three months. At twelve months follow-up, the iTIND group reported a mean decrease of 9.25 in IPSS, of 1.9-point in QoL and a 3.52mL/s increase in Qmax compared to baseline [564]. In a prospective multicentre study, 81 patients were enrolled and treated with a second generation iTIND device. At twelve-month follow-up, mean IPSS decreased from 22.5 to 8.8 and Qmax at one month increased from 7.3 to 14.7 ml/s at twelve months [565]. Another network meta-analysis included outcome data at three to six months follow-up and concluded that IPSS improvement was lower after iTIND compared to TURP. Improvements in objective outcomes (PVR and Qmax) were also lower after iTIND [540]. Tolerability and safety: The device were reported as well tolerated by all patients. Four early complications (12.5%) were recorded, including one case of urinary retention (3.1%), one case of transient incontinence due to device displacement (3.1%), and two cases of infection (6.2%). No further complications were recorded during the 36-month follow-up period [563]. In the RCT against sham study adverse events were typically mild and transient, most were Clavien-Dindo grade 1 or 2 with 38.1% in the iTIND arm and 17.5% in the control arm [564]. No new ejaculatory or erectile dysfunction has been reported [564,565]. In a prospective multicentre study, 81 patients were enrolled and treated with a second generation iTIND device. During the twelve-month period, two patients required medical therapy, two patients required TURP, and ten patients were lost to follow-up [565]. Practical considerations: Randomised controlled trials comparing iTIND to a reference technique are ongoing.
