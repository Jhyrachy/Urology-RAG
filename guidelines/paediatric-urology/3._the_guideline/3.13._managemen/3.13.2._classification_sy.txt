3.13.2. Classification systems. As bladder sphincter dysfunction is poorly correlated with the type and spinal level of the neurological lesion, urodynamic and functional classifications are much more practical for defining LUT pathology and planning treatment in children. The bladder and sphincter are two units working in harmony to act as a single functional unit. In patients with a neurogenic disorder, the storage and emptying phase of the bladder function can be disturbed. The bladder and sphincter may be either overactive or underactive and present in four different combinations. This classification system is based on urodynamic findings [682-684]: Overactive sphincter and overactive bladder.Overactive sphincter and underactive bladder.Underactive sphincter and overactive bladder.Underactive sphincter and underactive bladder.
