7.2.2. Role of lymph node dissection in locally-advanced RCC. In locally-advanced RCC, the role of LND is still controversial. The only available RCT demonstrated no survival benefit for patients undergoing LND but this trial mainly included organ-confined disease cases [293]. In the setting of locally-advanced disease, several retrospective papers and SRs addressed the topic with contradictory results. A SR and meta-analyses could not confirm any survival benefit in patients at high risk of progression treated with LND [435]. A More recent SR and meta-analyses showing a survival benefit in patients with locally-advanced disease treated with LND [436]. More specifically, thirteen studies on patients with LND and non-LND were identified and included in the analysis. In the subgroup of locally-advanced RCC (cT3-T4NxM0), LND showed a significantly better OS rate in patients who had undergone LND compared to those without LND (HR: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.60-0.90, p = 0.003). 7.2.2.1. Management of clinically negative lymph nodes (cN-) in locally-advanced RCC In case of cN-, the probability of finding pathologically-confirmed LN metastases ranges between 0-25%, depending mainly on primary tumour size and the presence of distant metastases [437]. In case of clinically- negative LNs (cN-) at imaging, removal of LNs is justified only if visible or palpable during surgery [438], at least for staging, prognosis, adjuvant therapy and follow-up implications, although a benefit in terms of cancer control has not yet been demonstrated [295,435]. 7.2.2.2. Management of clinically positive lymph nodes (cN+) in locally-advanced RCC In case of cN+, the probability to identify pathologically-confirmed LN metastases ranges between 10.3% (cT1 tumours) and up to 54.5% in case of locally-advanced disease. In cN+, removal of visible and palpable nodes during LND is justified [438], at least for staging, prognosis, adjuvant therapy and follow-up implications, although a benefit in terms of cancer control has not yet been demonstrated [295,435]. Whether to extend the LND in case of lymphadenopathy (cN1) remains controversial. In addition retrospective data showed for resected isolated macrospcopical lympnode metastises (pN1) that the time to systemic progression was a median of 4.2 months [439].
