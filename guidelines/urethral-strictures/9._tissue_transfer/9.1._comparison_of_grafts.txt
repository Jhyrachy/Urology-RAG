9.1. Comparison of grafts with flaps. One small RCT (LS excluded) comparing OMG with PSF found no significant difference in urethral patency rate [502]. Penile skin flaps had a higher urogenital morbidity (superficial penile skin necrosis, penile torsion, penile hypoesthesia, and post-void dribbling) and longer operation time compared to OMG. Furthermore, patient dissatisfaction was significantly higher with penile flaps [502]. Another small RCT (LS excluded) comparing penile skin grafts with PSF confirmed these findings with longer operation time and more superficial penile skin necrosis in the group of the flaps, whereas the urethral patency rate was similar between both groups [355]. Several retrospective series also found a comparable urethral patency rate between PSF and grafts [272,274,503,504] (Table 9.1).

Due to their robust vascular pedicle, flaps can be used as a tube as well as a patch in a single-stage approach [442]. Castagnetti et al., showed that grafts used as a tube have significantly higher complication rates as compared to onlay grafts (OR: 5.86; 95% CI: 1.5-23.4) [505]. A review by Patterson et al., also reported high (circa 50%) complication and recurrence rates for tubularised grafts [506]. Iqbal et al., have shown an encouraging 87% stricture-free rate in 23 patients who were offered single-stage circumferential skin flap urethroplasty [281]. Therefore, if there is a need to reconstruct a complete urethral segment with a tissuetransfer tube in a one-stage operation, flaps are usually the preferred option. As flaps carry their own vascular supply to the reconstruction site, they do not rely on the local vascularisation of the recipient site. Therefore, they need to be considered in case of poor urethral vascularisation (e.g., after irradiation or dense scarring after previous urethroplasty) [504,507]. In addition, flaps survive well in the presence of active urinary infection [508]. Grafts and flaps should not be considered competitors in urethral surgery. A combination of a flap with a graft is possible for complex, multifocal or penobulbar strictures [504,509,510]. Summary of evidenceLEFlaps have a higher urogenital morbidity, but a comparable patency rate compared to grafts.1bGrafts have a significantly higher complication rate compared to flaps when complete tubularisation in a single-stage approach is needed.1bFlaps do not rely on the local vascularisation of the recipient site.3 RecommendationsStrength ratingUse a graft above a flap when both options are equally indicated.StrongDo not use grafts in a tubularised fashion in a single-stage approach.StrongUse flaps in case of poor vascularisation of the urethral bed.Weak
