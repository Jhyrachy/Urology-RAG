6.3.5.1.2.1. Dilatation of non-traumatic posterior urethral stenosis. This can be done under loco-regional anaesthesia [375-379]. Dilatation is used for VUAS [375-380] or radiation induced BMS [381] and in the majority of reported cases, patients were not previously treated for their stricture (see supplementary Table S6.12). Patency rates vary widely between 0-89% [117,375-381]. The risk of de novo UI was low (0-11%) and no other complications were reported. It is of note that most series report on visually controlled dilatation [375-379] in VUAS without complete obliteration.
