3.10.1. epidemiology, aetiology pathophysiology. urinary tract infections (utis) represent common bacterial infections children [453-455]. several classification systems used define uti. neonates, symptoms differ many aspects infants children. prevalence higher; male predominance; infections caused organisms escherichia coli frequent; higher risk urosepsis . children presenting urinary symptoms pooled prevalence uti 7.8% (ci: 6.6-8.9) . incidence varies depending age sex. one meta-analysis showed children presenting fever first three months life utis present 7.5% girls, 2.4% (ci: 1.4-3.5) circumcised boys, 20.1% (ci: 16.8-23.4) uncircumcised boys . incidence boys highest first six months life (5.3%) decreases age around 2% ages 0-6 years. girls, utis less common first six months life (2%) incidence increases age around 11% ages 0-6 years . associated risk factors recurrent utis include bladder bowel dysfunction (bbd), vesicoureteral reflux (vur) obesity [459-461]. older children delay treatment often seen younger infants . risk factors combination delay treatment associated renal scarring . recurrent febrile utis, especially combination high-grade vur, lead renal scarring . new febrile uti increases risk renal scarring incidence renal scarring first uti, 2.8% (ci:1.2-5.8), 25.7% (ci:12.5-43.3) second infection 28.6% (ci:8.4-58.1) 3 febrile utis . leading causative organism utis e. coli, bacteriae rising prevalence. large european study e. coli found less 50% urine cultures. klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter spp., enterococcus spp., pseudomonas spp., proteus spp. candida spp. frequent nosocomial infections community-acquired utis, even though, prevalence increased outside hospital setting . neonatal uti frequently complicated bacteraemia. retrospective study, 12.4% blood cultures neonates admitted uti positive bacteraemia , however, less frequent community-acquired nosocomial uti .
