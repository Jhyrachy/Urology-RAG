3.3. testicular tumours prepubertal boys. 3.3.1. introduction testicular tumours account approximately 1-2% paediatric solid tumours . testicular tumours prepubertal boys differ several aspects testicular tumours adolescent adult men: lower incidence, different histologic distribution (teratomas yolk sac tumours common germ cell tumours less common) often benign. epidemiological study showed children age 15 years incidence highest asia (4.2 per million) south america (5 per million) lowest europe (2.1 per million) north america (2.5 per million). contrast incidence adolescent young adults highest incidence europe (137.4 per million), north america (94.9 per million), lower incidence observed south central america (66.5 per million) asia (27.1 per million) . age distribution prepubertal boys, small peak around age two years . studies demonstrated 60-75% tumours benign [124,127-131]. intratubular neoplasia (tin) practically non-existent children [132-135]. testicular tumours generally classified germ cell stromal tumours. one specific tumour type gonadoblastoma, contains germ cell stromal cell tumour types occur almost exclusively setting disorders sexual differentiation . past 30 years, clearly shown, fundamental difference testicular tumours childhood adulthood - terms difference incidence also terms histology . prepubertal boys, intratesticular tumours benign, whereas post puberty tumours likely malignant. 3.3.2. clinical presentation clinical presentation painless scrotal mass 90% patients, detected caregiver, physician patient himself. history trauma, pain hernia rare. hydrocele found 15 – 50% . boys early onset puberty (e.g. early penile prepubic hair growth) well high testosterone low gonadotropin levels, leydig cell tumour excluded . patients presenting scrotal mass, paratesticular tumours also taken account differential diagnosis. however, even less common compared intratesticular tumours. spectrum paratesticular tumours includes benign tumours leiomyoma, fibroma, lipoma, haemangioma, cystic lymphangioma lipoblastoma well malignant tumours paratesticular rhabdomyosarcoma excellent prognosis rare melanotic neuroectodermal tumour infancy high recurrence rate [139-142]. benign, intra-operative frozen section available surgery. organ sparing surgical approach preferred benign tumours, whereas malignant tumour standard orchiectomy carried out. 3.3.3. evaluation confirm diagnosis, high-resolution us examination (7.5 – 12.5 mhz), preferably doppler ultrasound, required. detection rate almost 100% [143-146]. high-resolution us, microlithiasis - small hyperdense areas without sound shadows - increasingly seen prepubertal boys. meta-analysis showed 4 296 boys (< 19 years age diagnosed microlithiasis) developed testicular tumour two previously testicular tumour opposite ipsilateral site . microlithiasis shows patients additional risk factors testicular tumour, caregivers/patients informed increased risk encouraged carry regular self-examinations - similar patients treated undescended testis . evidence, regular sonographic follow-up useful . risk infertility may higher patients microlithiasis patients sign infertility later, risk developing tumour seems higher compared patients without microlithiasis infertility . due low incidence contralateral tumour, even cases testicular microlithiasis, indication contralateral testicular biopsy prepubertal boys. age taken account, tumour markers used. human chorionic gonadotropin (ss-hcg) derived chorion carcinoma, embryonal carcinoma seminoma. however, tumours extremely rare prepubertal boys therefore ss-hcg useful prepubertal boys. alpha-fetoprotein (afp) clear limitation sensitivity specificity first months life sometimes takes twelve months serum concentration reaches known standard values (< 10 ng/ml) . produced > 90% yolk sac tumours. teratomas also produce afp, extent yolk sac tumours . alpha-fetoprotein measured therapeutic intervention (tumour enucleation/orchiectomy) ideally available time procedure. alpha-fetoprotein serum biological half-life five days measured five days tumour resection/orchiectomy elevated afp. urgent need pre-operative staging, consequence definitive histology available. 3.3.4. treatment/management testicular tumour suspected, surgery option intra-operative frozen section performed. necessary emergency procedure. however, order confirm diagnosis avoid familial anxiety, operation scheduled soon possible, preferably within next days. organ-preserving surgery performed, whenever possible. review article showed 227 patients organ-sparing surgery two cases (one patient epidermoid cyst one patient mature teratoma) recurrence [152-154]. orchiectomy could considered normal testicular parenchyma longer detectable pre-operatively high-resolution ultrasound and/or afp > 100 ng/ml > 12-month-old boy: highly suspicious yolk sac tumour. surgical technique, panel favour inguinal approach. furthermore, clamping vessels advantage better view, organ sparing surgery performed. however, evidence literature, tumour-spread prevented clamping vessels. whenever possible, testis sparing surgery performed along frozen sections surgery confirm diagnosis (begin vs. malignant tumour) confirm microscopically margin-negative resection performed, gross microscopic tumour remains primary tumour bed (r0 resection). cases r0 resection, tunica closed testis replaced scrotum. case r1 resection (removal macroscopic disease, microscopic margins positive tumour) confirmed frozen section malignant potential malignant tumour, orchiectomy performed time surgery. final pathology later demonstrates r1 resection malignant tumour despite intra-operative negative margins frozen section, inguinal orchiectomy safely performed. patients malignant tumour (yolk sac tumour, immature teratoma) staging performed including mri abdomen ct-scan chest. suspicion non-organ confined tumour, patient referred paediatric oncologist. patients rare diagnosis granulosa cell tumour, imaging abdomen exclude enlarged lymph nodes reasonable may potentially malignant tumour; sertoli leydig cell tumour, mri recommended, 10% malignant metastases respond well chemotherapy radiation adult literature . tnm classification 2015 adult testicular tumours used patients malignant tumour . benign tumours (mature teratoma, epidermoid cysts) staging required. 3.3.5. tumour entities prepubertal boys teratomas usually benign prepubertal children represent greatest proportion intratesticular tumours (around 40%) . present median age 13 months (0-18 months). adolescent adults, considered malignant tumours. histologically consist combination three primitive embryological germ-cell layers (ectoderm, mesoderm endoderm). elements shows microscopically mature elements ; however, immature teratomas age group also reported . exclude malignant potential, like focal areas yolk-sac tumour, entire specimen investigated. us examination heterogenous picture calcification seen afp less 100 ng/ml infant. organ-sparing surgery one recurrence reported literature . epidermoid cysts ectodermal origin seem related well-differentiated teratomas; always benign . keratin-producing epithelium responsible keratinised-squamous-epithelial deposits, appear hyperechogenic us . organ-sparing surgery performed confirmed histology, need surveillance despite fact one “recurrence” reported thirteen years diagnosis . juvenile granulosa cell tumours occur usually first year life, typically within first six months . well circumscribed typical yellow-tan appearance; 2/3 cystic elements, 1/3 solid . stroma fibrous fibromyxoid. far, recurrence reported organ-sparing surgery . leydig cell tumours arising testosterone producing leydig cells suspected boys early onset puberty high testosterone low gonadotropin levels . patients usually six ten years age; tumours well circumscribed yellow-brown nodules. children reports malignant leydig cell tumours organ sparing surgery, reported recurrences date . adult literature, malignancy rate 10% reported primary retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy discussed cases enlarged lymph nodes, metastases respond well chemotherapy radiation . around 1/5 sertoli-cell tumours occur children; usually within first year life . paediatric age group, large-cell calcifying sertoli cell tumours (lccsct) common tumour variant . occur patients complex dysplastic syndromes, carney peutz-jeghers syndrome [169-171]. except one case report histological diagnosis malignant lccsct , reported tumours benign, therefore organ-sparing surgery performed. yolk sac tumours predominant prepubertal malignant germ cell tumours may represent around 15% prepubertal tumours boys . also number names: endodermal sinus tumours, juvenile embryonal carcinoma, clear cell carcinoma, orchioblastoma, vitellineum, archenteronoma sometimes extraembryonal mesoblastoma . histologically mostly solid, yellow-grey tumours. occur usually within first two years life . 80-85% tumours organ confined (stage i) . tumour usually spreads haematogenously (chest). twenty percent stage disease may develop visible metastasis 20% within next two years. german study, 14 91 patients stage recurrence observation – cured chemotherapy alone. four five metastatic disease initially, cured chemotherapy radical orchiectomy . published series china, 21 90 paediatric patients stage yolk sac tumour received primary chemotherapy. one 21 recurrence, whereas 29 69 underwent surveillance initial orchiectomy recurrence. overall four-year survival rate 97.8% , almost recurrence rate also reported american oncology groups . therefore patients stage disease (no metastatic disease mri-abdomen ct scan chest well normal age-adapted afp values) close follow-up together paediatric oncologists including afp every two three months mri abdomen recommended, least first two three years . especially recommended invasions lymphatic vessels, shown prognostic factor one recent series . cases recurrence, chemotherapy performed paediatric oncologists according national study protocols. 3.3.6. follow-up regular us examination recommended follow-up period detect recurrence and/or abnormalities. studies recurrence testicular sparing surgery orchiectomy, clear recommendation made concerning interval duration follow-up. however, us examination every three six months within first year seems reasonable, recurrences detected time rate atrophy extremely low organ-sparing surgery . patients malignant tumour, regular follow-up examination first year surgery seems reasonable (see above). follow-up patients leydig cell tumour include endocrinological examinations. using seer data base, five-year relative survival testicular malignancies patients < 14 years age diagnosed localised testicular cancer 97.4%, distant disease 72.6% . 3.3.7. congenital adrenal hyperplasia boys
