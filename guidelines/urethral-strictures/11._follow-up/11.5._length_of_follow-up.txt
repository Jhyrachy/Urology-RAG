11.5. Length of follow-up after urethral surgery. The median time of recurrence after bulbar urethroplasty is approximately ten months [334]. In case series, between 55.4% [587] and 96% [569,572] of all recurrences are detected during the first year of follow-up after urethral surgery. Twenty-three percent of bulbar stricture recurrences are detected during the second year of follow-up, and the percentage of recurrences decreases after the second year [346]. On the other hand, long-term follow-up studies highlighted the role of length of follow-up as a predictor for stricture recurrence after bulbar urethroplasty [346,588]. Late recurrences – later than five years after urethroplasty – could be observed in up to 15% of cases [144,331,346]. This should be considered mainly after augmentation urethroplasties, especially in case skin grafts were used [571]. Certainly, patients should be instructed to seek urological evaluation if they experience late recurrent symptoms [588].
