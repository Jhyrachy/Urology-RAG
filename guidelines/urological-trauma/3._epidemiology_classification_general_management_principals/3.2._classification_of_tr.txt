3.2. Classification of trauma. Traumatic injuries are classified by the World Health Organization (WHO) into intentional (either interpersonal violence related, war-related or self-inflicted injuries), and unintentional injuries (mainly road traffic accidents/injury, falls, and other domestic accidents). Intentional trauma accounts for approximately half of the trauma-related deaths worldwide [11]. A specific type of unintentional injury is iatrogenic injury which occurs during therapeutic or diagnostic procedures by healthcare personnel. Traumatic insults are classified according to the basic mechanism of the injury into penetrating, when an object pierces the skin, and blunt injuries. Penetrating trauma is further classified according to the velocity of the projectile into: high-velocity projectiles (e.g. rifle bullets - 800-1,000 m/sec);medium-velocity projectiles (e.g. handgun bullets - 200-300 m/sec);low-velocity items (e.g. knife stab). High-velocity weapons inflict greater damage due to a temporary expansive cavitation that causes destruction in a much larger area than the projectile tract itself. In lower velocity injuries, the damage is usually confined to the projectile tract. Blast injury is a complex cause of trauma which includes blunt and penetrating trauma and burns. The most commonly used classification grading system is the AAST (American Association for the Surgery of Trauma) injury scoring scale [12]. It is useful for managing renal trauma, but for the other urological organs, the injuries are commonly described by their anatomical site and severity (partial/complete).
