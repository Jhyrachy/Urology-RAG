6.6. Prognostic models. Prognostic models combining independent prognostic factors have been developed and externally validated [247-254]. These models are more accurate than TNM stage or grade alone for predicting clinically relevant oncological outcomes (LE: 3). Before being adopted, new prognostic models should be evaluated and compared to current prognostic models with regards to discrimination, calibration and net benefit. Pathological prognostic factors are used in the Leibovich 2003 score/groups for clear cell [250]. There are prognostic models for non-clear cell RCC, like the VENUSS score for papillary RCC [201]. Although both were validated in several studies and showed superior discrimination to other prognostic models, molecular markers are needed [255-258]. In metastatic disease, risk groups assigned by the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Centre (MSKCC) (primarily created in the pre-targeted therapy era and validated in patients receiving targeted therapy) and the IMDC (initially created in the targeted therapy era) differ in 23% of cases [259]. The IMDC model has been used in most of the recent RCTs, including those with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), and may therefore be the preferred model for clinical practice. The discrimination of the IMDC models improves by additional variables, such as presence of brain metastasis, bone metastasis, liver metastasis, NLR and platelet count [260-263]. Tables 6.3 and 6.4 summarise the current most relevant prognostic models.
