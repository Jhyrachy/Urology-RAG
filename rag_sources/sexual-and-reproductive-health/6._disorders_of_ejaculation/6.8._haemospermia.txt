6.8. haemospermia. 6.8.1. definition classification haemospermia defined appearance blood ejaculate. although often regarded symptom minor significance, blood ejaculate causes anxiety many men may indicate underlying pathology . 6.8.2. pathophysiology risk factors several causes haemospermia acknowledged classified following sub-categories; idiopathic, congenital malformations, inflammatory conditions, obstruction, malignancies, vascular abnormalities, iatrogenic/trauma systemic causes (table 16) . table 16: pathology associated haemospermia [791-794] categorycausescongenitalseminal

excluding serious, despite infrequent, underlying cause (e.g., cancer), time preventing over-investigation alleviating patient anxiety. literature describes multitude causes haemospermia, although many commonly found investigation. however, men may stratified higher-risk groups according several factors including: age > 40 years, recurrent persistent haemospermia, actual risk pca (e.g., positive family history), concurrent haematuria. based literature, management algorithm proposed (figure 8) . figure 8: management algorithm haemospermia sti = sexually transmitted infections; psa =
