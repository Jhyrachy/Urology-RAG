5.2. Imaging. 5.2.1. Computed tomography Computed tomography (CT) urography has the highest diagnostic accuracy of the available imaging techniques [90]. A meta-analysis of 13 studies comprising 1,233 patients revealed a pooled sensitivity of CT urography for UTUC of 92% (CI: 0.85–0.96) and a pooled specificity of 95% (CI: 0.88–0.98) [91]. Rapid acquisition of thin sections allows high-resolution isotropic images that can be viewed in multiple planes to assist with diagnosis without loss of resolution. Epithelial “flat lesions” without mass effect or urothelial thickening are generally not visible with CT. The presence of enlarged LNs on CT is highly predictive of metastases in UTUC [92,93]. 5.2.2. Magnetic resonance urography Magnetic resonance (MR) urography is indicated in patients who cannot undergo CT urography, usually when radiation or iodinated contrast media are contraindicated [94]. The sensitivity of MR urography is 75% after contrast injection for tumours < 2 cm [94]. Computed tomography urography is more sensitive and specific for the diagnosis and staging of UTUC compared to MR urography [95]. 5.2.3.18F-Fluorodeoxglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography A retrospective multicentre publication on the use of 18F-Fluorodeoxglucose positron emission tomography/ computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) for the detection of nodal metastasis in 117 surgically-treated UTUC patients reported promising sensitivity and specificity of 82% and 84%, respectively. Suspicious LNs on FDG-PET/CT were associated with worse recurrence-free survival [96]. These results warrant further validation and comparison with MR and CT. FDG-PET can also be used to assess (nodal and distant) metastases in patients unfit for iodinated contrast media due to renal impairment or allergy.
