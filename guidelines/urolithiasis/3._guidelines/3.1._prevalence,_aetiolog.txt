3.1. Prevalence, aetiology, risk of recurrence. 3.1.1. Introduction Stone incidence depends on geographical, climatic, ethnic, dietary, and genetic factors. The recurrence risk is basically determined by the disease or disorder causing the stone formation. Accordingly, the prevalence rates for urinary stones vary from 1% to 20% [6]. In countries with a high standard of life such as Sweden, Canada or the USA, renal stone prevalence is notably high (> 10%). For some areas, an increase of more than 37% over the last 20 years has been reported [7-9]. There is emerging evidence linking nephrolithiasis to the risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) [10]. Stones can be stratified into those caused by: infections, non-infectious causes, genetic defects [11,12]; or adverse drug effects (drug stones) (Table 3.1). See also section 3.2.

Stone composition Stone composition is the basis for further diagnostic and management decisions. Stones are often formed from a mixture of substances. Table 3.2 lists the most clinically relevant substances and their mineral components.

Risk groups for stone formation Determination of the risk for stone formation is imperative for pharmacological treatment. Previous stone history (recurrence, regrowth, stone surgeries) is a fundamental element in determining risk for stone formation. About 50% of recurrent stone formers have just one-lifetime recurrence [9,14]. A review of first-time stone formers calculated a recurrence rate of 26% in five years’ time [15]. Highly recurrent disease is observed in slightly more than 10% of patients. Stone type and disease severity determine low- or high-risk stone formers (Table 3.3) [16-32]. However, the risk status of stone formers should be determined in a holistic way taking into consideration not only the probability of stone recurrence or regrowth, but also the risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD), end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), and metabolic bone disorder (MBD) [33,34]. A comprehensive evaluation of stone risk in patients should also include the risk of developing CKD, ESKD, and MBD (Tables 3.4, 3.5, and 3.6) [33]. Urolithiasis can compromise renal function because of the renal stone (obstruction, infection), renal tissue damage due to the primary condition causing stone formation (some genetic diseases, nephrocalcinosis, enteric hyperoxaluria, etc.), or urological treatments for the condition [33]. Certain risk factors have been shown to be associated with such a risk in stone formers, as shown below. Table 3.3: High-risk stone formers  General factorsEarly onset of urolithiasis (especially children and teenagers)Familial stone formationRecurrent stone formersShort time since last stone episodeBrushite-containing stones (CaHPO4.2H2O)Uric acid and urate-containing stonesInfection stonesSolitary kidney (the kidney itself does not particularly increase the risk of stone formation, but prevention of stone recurrence is of crucial importance to avoid acute renal failure)Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)Diseases associated with stone formationHyperparathyroidismMetabolic syndromeMineral Bone Disorder (MBD)NephrocalcinosisPolycystic kidney disease (PKD)Gastrointestinal diseases (i.e., enteric hyperoxaluria due to jejuno-ileal bypass, intestinal resection, Crohn’s disease, malabsorptive conditions, urinary diversion, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, and bariatric surgery).Increased levels of vitamin DSarcoidosisSpinal cord injury, neurogenic bladderGenetically determined stone formationCystinuria (type A, B and AB)Primary hyperoxaluria (PH)Renal tubular acidosis (RTA) type I2,8-DihydroxyadeninuriaXanthinuriaLesch-Nyhan syndromeCystic fibrosisDrug-induced stone formation (see Table 4.11)Anatomical abnormalities associated with stone formationMedullary sponge kidney (tubular ectasia)Ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) obstructionCalyceal diverticulum, calyceal cystUreteral strictureVesico-uretero-renal refluxHorseshoe kidneyUreteroceleEnvironmental and professional factorsHigh ambient temperaturesChronic lead and cadmium exposure Table 3.4 Risk factors for CKD and ESKD in stone formerss Risk factors for CKD/ESKD in stone formersFemale genderOverweightFrequent UTIStruvite stonesAcquired single kidneyNeurogenic bladderPrevious obstructive nephropathyIleal conduit Furthermore, some specific kinds of urolithiasis also carry a particular risk of developing CKD/ESKD as shown below.
