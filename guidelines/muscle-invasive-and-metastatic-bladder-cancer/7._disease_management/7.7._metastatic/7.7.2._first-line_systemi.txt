7.7.2. First-line systemic therapy for metastatic disease. In general, patients with untreated metastatic UC can be divided into two broad categories: eligible for combination therapies or ineligible for combination therapies. The distinction between the two groups is currently based on the eligibility criteria for the pivotal trial EV-302/KEYNOTE 39A and is likely to undergo changes in the near future based on results from real-world evidence investigations. Major criteria include ECOG performance status 0-2, GFR â‰¥ 30 ml/min and adequate organ functions based on eligibility for treatment with Enfortumab vedotin and Pembrolizumab. With regards to platinum-based chemotherapy the definitions to distinguish patients fit for cisplatin, fit for carboplatin und unfit for any platinum-based therapy remains valid as outlined below and summarised in Table 7.2.
