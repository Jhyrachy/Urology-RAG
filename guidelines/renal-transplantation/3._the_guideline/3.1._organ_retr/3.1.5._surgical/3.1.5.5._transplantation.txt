3.1.5.5. Transplantation/ureteric implantation in abnormal urogenital tract. The following points should be considered when performing kidney transplantation in the abnormal urogenital tract: In patients with an ileal conduit, a kidney transplant may be placed upside down to align the ureter to the conduit and avoid a redundant ureter [150].The technique used to implant transplant ureter(s) into an ileal conduit is the same as the method used with native ureter(s) (Bricker; Wallace).In bladder augmentation or continent pouches, ureters should be implanted with a tunnel technique or extra-vesically (Lich-Gregoir). The latter is favoured in most patients.In patients with a Mitrofanoff catheterisable stoma or continent ileo-caecal pouch with catheterisable stoma, consideration should be given to the positioning of the catheterisable stoma (umbilical or iliac fossa - usually right-side) with clear communication with the transplant surgeons so that the position of any future transplant kidney is not compromised. If an intra-peritoneal placement of a future kidney transplant is likely, then placement of a Mitrofanoff exiting in the iliac fossa is preferable at the umbilicus. If a future kidney transplant is likely in the right iliac fossa then placement of a Mitrofanoff exiting at the umbilicus or left iliac fossa may be preferable.
