5.5. Management of Nocturia in men with lower urinary tract symptoms. The following section reports a SR of therapy for the management of nocturia in men with LUTS. It also emphasises the need to consider the wide range of possible causes of nocturia [566]. Nocturia has been defined as the complaint of waking at night to void [3]. The ICS Standardisation Steering Committee has introduced the concept of main sleep period, defined as “the period from the time of falling asleep to the time of intending to rise for the next “day” [567]. Nocturia reflects the relationship between the amount of urine produced while asleep, and the ability of the bladder to store the urine received. Nocturia can occur as part of lower urinary tract dysfunction (LUTD), such as OAB and chronic pelvic pain syndrome. Nocturia can also occur in association with other forms of LUTD, such as BOO, but here it is debated whether the link is one of causation or simply the co-existence of two common conditions. Crucially, nocturia may have behavioural, sleep disturbance (primary or secondary) or systemic causes unrelated to LUTD (Table 2). Differing causes often co-exist and each has to be considered in all cases. Only where LUTD is contributory should nocturia be termed a LUTS.
