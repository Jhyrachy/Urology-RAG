5.3. Urinary cytology. Urinary cytology is part of the standard work-up of a patient with suspected primary urethral carcinoma. Reporting of urinary cytology findings should follow the Paris system [38]. However, the role of urinary cytology in primary urethral carcinoma is limited since its sensitivity ranges between 55% and 59% [39]. Detection rates depend on the underlying histological entity. In male patients, the sensitivity for UC and SCC was reported to be 80% and 50%, respectively, whereas in female patients, sensitivity was found to be 77% for SCC and 50% for UC [39].
