4.4.4. Summary of evidence and recommendations for the evaluation and management of urethral trauma. Summary of evidenceLEImplementing training programmes on urinary catheter insertion for personnel involved with urethral catheterisation significantly improves the rate of catheter-related complications.2bIn males, a urethral injury is detected as contrast extravasation during urethrography or as a mucosal laceration during cysto-urethroscopy.3As opposed to cysto-urethroscopy, voiding cysto-urethrography will miss a female urethral injury in approximately 50% of cases.3Transurethral or suprapubic urinary diversion are the treatment options for iatrogenic injuries.3With urinary diversion (suprapubic or transurethral catheter) satisfactory urethral luminal re-canalisation may occur after partial blunt anterior urethral ruptures.3Complete blunt anterior urethral ruptures are unlikely to be cured by urinary diversion alone, whereas immediate urethroplasty has an equal success rate compared to delayed urethroplasty. The main advantage of immediate urethroplasty is to reduce the time to spontaneous voiding.3If PFUIs are associated with life-threatening injuries, urethral management has no priority and urinary diversion with either urethral or suprapubic catheterisation is sufficient initially.3With early endoscopic re-alignment the stricture rate is reduced to 44-49% without increased risk of incontinence or erectile dysfunction.3Repetitive endoscopic treatments after failed re-alignment delay the time to definitive cure and increase the incidence of adverse events.3For partial posterior injuries, urinary diversion (suprapubic or transurethral) is sufficient as these injuries might heal without significant scarring or obstruction.3Immediate urethroplasty (< 48 hours) in male PFUI is associated with a higher risk of bleeding, stricture, incontinence, and impotence rates compared to delayed urethroplasty.3In selected patients for male PFUI, early urethroplasty (two days to six weeks) is associated with similar stricture, incontinence and impotence rates compared to delayed urethroplasty.3Suprapubic diversion with delayed urethroplasty in male PFUI with complete urethral disruption is associated with an 86% stricture free success rate and with no significant impact on erectile function and urinary continence.2aEarly repair in female PFUI has the lowest complication rate.3 RecommendationsStrength ratingProvide appropriate training to reduce the risk of traumatic catheterisation.StrongEvaluate male urethral injuries with flexible cysto-urethroscopy and/or retrograde urethrography.StrongEvaluate female urethral injuries with cysto-urethroscopy and vaginoscopy.StrongTreat iatrogenic anterior urethral injuries by transurethral or suprapubic urinary diversion.StrongTreat partial blunt anterior urethral injuries by suprapubic or urethral catheterisation.StrongTreat complete blunt anterior urethral injuries by immediate urethroplasty, if surgical expertise is available, otherwise perform suprapubic diversion with delayed urethroplasty.WeakTreat pelvic fracture urethral injuries (PFUIs) in haemodynamically unstable patients by transurethral or suprapubic catheterisation initially.StrongPerform early endoscopic re-alignment in male PFUIs when feasible.WeakDo not repeat endoscopic treatments after failed re-alignment for male PFUI.StrongTreat partial posterior urethral injuries initially by suprapubic or transurethral catheter.StrongDo not perform immediate urethroplasty (< 48 hours) in male PFUIs.StrongPerform early urethroplasty (two days to six weeks) for male PFUIs with complete disruption in selected patients (stable, short gap, soft perineum, lithotomy position possible).WeakManage complete posterior urethral disruption in male PFUIs with suprapubic diversion and deferred (at least three months) urethroplasty.StrongPerform early repair (within seven days) for female PFUIs (not delayed repair or early re-alignment).Strong
