7.4.4.2. Treatment of patients with non-clear-cell metastatic RCC (general considerations). For the sake of historical purposes, the Panel recognises the use of Non-cc-mRCC but will where possible refer to the distinct subtype. This is a heterogenous group including papillary, chromophobe and other rare tumours with a widely differing tumour biology. Patients with non-cc-mRCC should therefore be referred to a clinical trial, where appropriate.While no phase III trials of patients with non-cc-mRCC have been reported it is increasingly recognised to study specific subtypes which have a higher incidence than other non-ccRCC. As papillary RCC (pRCC) comprise the majority of tumours defined as non-ccRCC, most of the evidence is available for this subtype, either from trials specifically selecting pRCC or having included a high percentage. 7.4.4.2.1. Treatment of patients with papillary metastatic RCC There are small single-arm trials for sunitinib and everolimus [593-597]. Both these agents have been widely given in pRCC, but more recent data suggests cabozantinib and other combinations may be preferable [598,599]. For pRCC new evidence is available from the SWOG PAPMET randomised phase II trial which compared sunitinib to cabozantinib, crizotinib and savolitinib in 152 patients with papillary mRCC [598]. Progression- free survival was longer in patients in the cabozantinib group (median 9.0 months, 95% CI: 6-12) than in the sunitinib group (5.6 months, CI: 3-7; HR for progression or death 0.60 [0.37-0.97, one-sided p = 0.019]). Response rate for cabozantinib was 23% vs. 4% for sunitinib (two-sided p = 0.010). Savolitinib and crizotinib did not improve PFS compared with sunitinib. Grade III or IV adverse events occurred in 69% (31/45) of patients receiving sunitinib, 74% (32/43) of patients receiving cabozantinib, 37% (10/27) receiving crizotinib, and 39% (11/28) receiving savolitinib; one grade V thromboembolic event was recorded in the cabozantinib group. These results support adding cabozantinib as an option for patients with papillary mRCC based on superior PFS results compared to sunitinib. In addition, savolitinib was investigated in the SAVOIR trial [599] as first-line treatment for MET-driven tumours defined as chromosome 7 gain, MET amplification, MET kinase domain variations or hepatocyte growth factor amplification by DNA alteration analysis (~30% of screened patients were MET positive). In a limited patient group, savolitinib (n = 27) was compared with sunitinib (n = 33). The trial was stopped early, largely due to poor accrual. The efficacy data appeared to favour savolitinib (median PFS 7.0 months, 95% CI: 2.8 months-NR vs. 5.6 months, 95% CI: 4.1-6.9 months, PFS HR: 0.71, 95% CI: 0.37-1.36, OS HR: 0.51,94% CI: 0.21-1.17, RR: 27% vs. 7%, for savolitinib and sunitinib, respectively). The median OS for savolitinib was not reported, Savolitinib was better tolerated compared with sunitinib with 42% grade > 3 AEs compared to 81% with sunitinib. There are ongoing trials to confirm these findings. The results on these trials are required before recommendations can be made. Evidence for TKI + IO based combination is derived from two phase II studies of lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab and cabozantinib and nivolumab. The Keynote-B61 phase II trial investigated lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab administered to non-ccRCC patients of whom 93 patients (59%) with pRCC [600,601]. The primary endpoint of objective response was 54% in pRCC patients, with a median follow-up of 14.9 months, providing some evidence of good efficacy for TKI + IO based combinations. The cabozantinib and nivolumab study enrolled 40 patients with papillary and unclassified RCC with a response rate of 47% and a PFS of 13 (7-16) months [602]. In this trial chromophobe RCC was excluded and the percentage of pRCC was 68%. Indirect comparisons suggest these data compare to an increased efficacy with those of VEGFR-TKI monotherapy alone. Efficacy for pembrolizumab in the pRCC subset (118/165) was; RR: 29%, PFS: 5.5 months (95% CI: 3.9-6.1 months) and OS: 31.5 months (95% CI: 25.5 months-NR), but these results are based on a single-arm phase II study [603]. Pembrolizumab can be considered in this setting due to the high unmet need; although the VEGFR TKI + IO combination may be preferable. 7.4.4.2.2.

Treatment of patients with metastatic non-ccRCC other than papillary RCC The evidence surrounding systemic therapy for non-ccRCC tumours other than pRCC is especially weak and has relied on subset analysis of randomised phase II trials as well as expanded access programmes. Results consistently demonstrate that the outcome of these patients with targeted therapy is poorer than for ccRCC. Treatment in non-cc-mRCC has focused on temsirolimus, everolimus, sorafenib, sunitinib, cabozantinib and pembrolizumab in the past [593,602,604-606]. Recent data of single-arm phase II trials of lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab demonstrated clinical efficacy of this IO+TKI combinations in different non-ccRCC subgroups. [600,601,607]. Meadian ORR across the different non-ccRCC subgroups of 158 patiens was 49%, 12 months PFS and OS rates were 63% and 82%. 7.4.4.2.4. Summary of evidence and recommendation for systemic therapy in chromophobe and unclassified RCC Summary of evidenceLEBoth mTOR inhibitors and VEGF-targeted therapies have limited activity in non-cc-mRCC.
