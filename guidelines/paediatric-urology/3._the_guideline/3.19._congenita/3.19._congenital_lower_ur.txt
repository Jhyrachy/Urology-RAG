3.19. Congenital lower urinary tract obstruction (CLUTO). Introduction The term congenital lower urinary tract obstruction (CLUTO) is used for intrauterine dilatation of the bladder and/or the upper urinary tract. During pregnancy the diagnosis is usually based on ultrasound examinations. There is a broad spectrum of conditions that could cause an intrauterine dilatation of the urinary tract. Congenital lower urinary tract obstruction is most commonly the result of posterior urethral valves (PUV), in approximately 60% of cases. Postpartum diagnosis, however comprises any number of anatomical and functional disorders/anomalies/malformations causing dilatation e.g. anterior urethral valves, urethral atresia/ stenosis, prune belly syndrome, dilating VUR, cloacal malformation, prolapsing ureterocele, megacystis-microcolon-intestinal hypoperistalsis or megacystis-megaureter syndrome [1291]. Due to the heterogeneity and the rare spectrum of clinical manifestations of CLUTO, referral of such cases is recommended to a tertiary centre with multidisciplinary expertise in prenatal and postnatal management of obstructive uropathies [1291]. Megacystis In the first trimester, fetal megacystis is defined as a bladder with a longitudinal diameter ≥ 7 mm. A longitudinal (craniocaudal) diameter between 7-12 mm in the first trimester is usually transient, disappearing in about 90% of cases during the second trimester. A measurement > 15 mm however, indicates CLUTO is unlikely to resolve [1291]. In the second and third trimester, megacystis is defined by an enlarged bladder failing to empty during an extended US examination lasting at least 40 minutes. Two thirds of cases are secondary to CLUTO and the remainder are associated with genetic syndromes, developmental or chromosomal abnormalities, including anorectal malformations, of which 14% were normal or had an isolated urological abnormality (e.g. VUR, Duplex system) [1291,1292]. In a systematic review ≥ 45% of megacystis cases were shown to be associated with oligohydramnios and 15% had chromosomal abnormalities [1293]. Final diagnoses included PUV (57%), urethral atresia/stenosis (7%), prune-belly syndrome (4%), megacystis-microcolon-intestinal hypoperistalsis syndrome (MMIHS) (1%), cloacal abnormality (0.7%) and undefined pathologies (36.5%) [1293]. The prognosis of the fetus depends on the underlying pathology, the timing of diagnosis, the presence of oligo/anhydramnios and bladder volume.
