4.1. Erectile dysfunction. Epidemiological data have shown a high prevalence and incidence of ED worldwide [191]. Among others, the Massachusetts Male Aging Study (MMAS) [192] reported an overall prevalence of 52% ED in non-institutionalised men aged 40-70 years in the Boston area; specific prevalence for minimal, moderate, and complete ED was 17.2%, 25.2%, and 9.6%, respectively. In the Cologne study of men aged 30-80 years, the prevalence of ED was 19.2%, with a steep age-related increase from 2.3% to 53.4% [193]. The incidence rate of ED (new cases per 1,000 men annually) was 26 in the long-term data from the MMAS study [194] and 19.2 (mean follow-up of 4.2 years) in a Dutch study [195]. In a cross-sectional real-life study among men seeking first medical help for new-onset ED, one in four patients were younger than 40 years, with almost 50% of the young men complaining of severe ED [196]. Differences among these studies can be explained by differences in methodology, ages, and socio-economic and cultural status of the populations studied. The prevalence rates of ED studies are reported in Table 1 online supplementary evidence: https://uroweb.org/guidelines/sexual-and-reproductive-health/publications-appendices.
