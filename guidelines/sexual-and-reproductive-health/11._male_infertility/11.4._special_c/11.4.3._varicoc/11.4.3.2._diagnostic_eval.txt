11.4.3.2. Diagnostic evaluation. The diagnosis of varicocele is made by physical examination and Scrotal Doppler US is indicated if physical examination is inconclusive or semen analysis remains unsatisfactory after varicocele repair to identify persistent and recurrent varicocele [1522,1717]. A maximum venous diameter of > 3 mm in the upright position and during the Valsalva manoeuvre and venous reflux with a duration > 2 seconds correlate with the presence of a clinically significant varicocele [1718,1719]. To calculate testicular volume Lambertâ€™s formula (V=L x W x H x 0.71) should be used, as it correlates well with testicular function in patients with infertility and/or varicocele [1720]. Patients with isolated, clinical right varicocele should be examined further for abdominal, retroperitoneal and congenital pathology and anomalies.
