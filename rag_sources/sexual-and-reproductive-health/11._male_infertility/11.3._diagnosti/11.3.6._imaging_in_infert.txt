11.3.6. imaging infertile men. addition physical examination, scrotal us may helpful in: (i) measuring testicular volume; (ii) assessing testicular anatomy structure terms us patterns, thus detecting signs testicular dysgenesis often related impaired spermatogenesis (e.g., non-homogeneous testicular architecture microcalcifications) testicular tumours; and, (iii) finding indirect signs obstruction (e.g., dilatation rete testis, enlarged epididymis cystic lesions, absent vas deferens) . clinical practice, prader’s orchidometer-derived testicular volume considered reliable surrogate us-measured testicular volume, easier perform cost-effective . nevertheless, scrotal us relevant role testicular volume assessment prader’s orchidometer unreliable (e.g., large hydrocele, inguinal testis, epididymal enlargement/fibrosis, thickened scrotal skin; small testis, epididymis large comparison total testicular volume ). ultrasound patterns testicular inhomogeneity usually associated ageing, although also reported association testicular atrophy fibrosis . diagnostic testicular biopsy recommended testicular inhomogeneity detected . 11.3.6.1. scrotal us scrotal us widely used everyday clinical practice patients oligo-zoospermia azoospermia, infertility found additional risk factor testicular cancer . used diagnosis several diseases causing infertility including obstructive azoospermia (see section 11.4), testicular neoplasms varicocele. 11.3.6.1.1. testicular neoplasms one study, men infertility increased risk testicular cancer (hazard ratio [hr] 3.3). infertility refined according individual semen parameters, oligozoospermic men increased risk cancer compared fertile control subjects (hr 11.9) . recent systematic review infertile men testicular microcalcification (tm) found ~18-fold higher prevalence testicular cancer . utility us routine screening tool men infertility detect testicular cancer remains matter debate . indeed, testicular lesions difficult characterise benign malignant based upon us criteria, including size, vascularity echogenicity. dichotomous cut-off certainty terms lesion size may definitely distinguish benign malignant testicular masses currently available. systematic review meta-analysis carried testicular cancer sexual reproductive health eau guidelines panels define scrotal us magnetic resonance imaging (mri) characteristics predict benign malignant disease pre- post-pubertal males indeterminate testicular masses . benign malignant masses classified using reported reference test: i.e., histopathology, 12 months progression-free radiological surveillance. total 32 studies identified, including 1692 masses 28 studies 1550 masses reported scrotal us features, four studies 142 masses reported mri features. meta-analysis different scrotal us (b-mode) values post-pubertal men demonstrated size ≤0.5 cm significantly lower malignancy compared masses >0.5 cm (p < 0.001). comparison masses 0.6-1.0 cm masses > 1.5 cm also demonstrated significantly lower malignancy (p = 0.04). significant difference masses 0.6-1.0 1.1-1.5 cm. scrotal us post-pubertal men also significantly lower malignancy heterogenous masses compared homogenous masses (p = 0.04), hyperechogenic vs. hypoechogenic masses (p < 0.01), normal vs. increased enhancement (p < 0.01), peripheral vs. central vascularity (p < 0.01), respectively. limited data pre-pubertal sus, pre-pubertal mri post-pubertal mri . small hypoechoic/hyperechoic areas may diagnosed intra-testicular cysts, focal leydig cell hyperplasia, fibrosis focal testicular inhomogeneity previous pathological conditions. hence, require careful periodic us assessment follow-up, especially additional risk factors malignancy present (i.e., infertility, bilateral tm, history cryptorchidism, testicular atrophy, inhomogeneous parenchyma, history testicular tumour, history of/contralateral tumour) . case interval growth lesion and/or presence additional risk factors malignancy, testicular biopsy/surgery may considered, although evidence adopting management policy limited. 145 men referred azoospermia underwent us testicular biopsy, 49 (34%) focal us abnormality; hypoechoic lesion found 20 patients (14%), hyperechoic lesions seen 10 patients (7%); and, heterogeneous appearance testicular parenchyma seen 19 patients (13%). 18 evaluable patients, 11 lesions < 5 mm; confirmed benign. patients hyperechoic heterogeneous areas us subsequent tissue diagnoses found benign lesions. authors concluded men severe infertility incidental testicular lesions, negative tumour markers lesions < 5 mm may observed serial scrotal us examinations enlarging lesions greater dimension considered histological biopsy . studies suggested testicular lesion hyperechoic non-vascular colour doppler us associated negative tumour markers, likelihood malignancy low consideration given regular testicular surveillance, alternative radical surgery. contrast, hypoechoic vascular lesions likely malignant [1645-1649]. however, lesions cannot characterised us (indeterminate), histology remains certain diagnostic tool. multidisciplinary team discussion (mdt), including invasive diagnostic modalities, therefore considered patients. role us-guided intra-operative frozen section analysis diagnosis testicular cancer indeterminate lesions considered, several authors proposed value intra-operative diagnosis indeterminate testicular lesions . although default treatment patient counselling mdt discussion may radical orchidectomy, us-guided biopsy intra-operative frozen section analysis may offered alternative radical orchidectomy potentially obviate need removal testis patient seeking fertility treatment. men azoospermia concurrent tese sperm banking also performed time surgical intervention. 11.3.6.1.2. varicocele present, clinical management varicocele still mainly based physical examination; nevertheless, scrotal colour doppler us useful assessing venous reflux diameter, palpation unreliable and/or detecting recurrence/persistence surgery . definitive evidence reflux venous diameter may utilised decision treat (see section 11.4.3.1 11.4.3.2). 11.3.6.1.3. scrotal us able detect changes proximal part seminal tract due obstruction. especially cbavd patients, scrotal us favourable option detect abnormal appearance epididymis. given that, three types epididymal findings described cbavd patients: tubular ectasia (honeycomb appearance), meshwork pattern, complete partial absence epididymis . 11.3.6.2. transrectal us patients low seminal volume, acidic ph severe oligozoospermia azoospermia, obstruction suspected, scrotal transrectal us clinical value detecting cbavd presence absence epididymis and/or seminal vesicles (sv) (e.g., abnormalities/agenesis). likewise, transrectal us (trus) important role assessing obstructive azoospermia (oa) secondary cbavd anomalies related obstruction ejaculatory ducts, ejaculatory duct cysts, seminal vesicle dilatation hypoplasia/atrophy, although retrograde ejaculation excluded differential diagnosis .
