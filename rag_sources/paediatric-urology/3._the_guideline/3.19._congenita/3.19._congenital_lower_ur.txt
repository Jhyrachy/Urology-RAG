3.19. congenital lower urinary tract obstruction (cluto). introduction term congenital lower urinary tract obstruction (cluto) used intrauterine dilatation bladder and/or upper urinary tract. pregnancy diagnosis usually based ultrasound examinations. broad spectrum conditions could cause intrauterine dilatation urinary tract. congenital lower urinary tract obstruction commonly result posterior urethral valves (puv), approximately 60% cases. postpartum diagnosis, however comprises number anatomical functional disorders/anomalies/malformations causing dilatation e.g. anterior urethral valves, urethral atresia/ stenosis, prune belly syndrome, dilating vur, cloacal malformation, prolapsing ureterocele, megacystis-microcolon-intestinal hypoperistalsis megacystis-megaureter syndrome . due heterogeneity rare spectrum clinical manifestations cluto, referral cases recommended tertiary centre multidisciplinary expertise prenatal postnatal management obstructive uropathies . megacystis first trimester, fetal megacystis defined bladder longitudinal diameter ≥ 7 mm. longitudinal (craniocaudal) diameter 7-12 mm first trimester usually transient, disappearing 90% cases second trimester. measurement > 15 mm however, indicates cluto unlikely resolve . second third trimester, megacystis defined enlarged bladder failing empty extended us examination lasting least 40 minutes. two thirds cases secondary cluto remainder associated genetic syndromes, developmental chromosomal abnormalities, including anorectal malformations, 14% normal isolated urological abnormality (e.g. vur, duplex system) . systematic review ≥ 45% megacystis cases shown associated oligohydramnios 15% chromosomal abnormalities . final diagnoses included puv (57%), urethral atresia/stenosis (7%), prune-belly syndrome (4%), megacystis-microcolon-intestinal hypoperistalsis syndrome (mmihs) (1%), cloacal abnormality (0.7%) undefined pathologies (36.5%) . prognosis fetus depends underlying pathology, timing diagnosis, presence oligo/anhydramnios bladder volume.
