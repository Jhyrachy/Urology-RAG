5.5.1. Diagnostic assessment. Evaluation is outlined in Figure 5; Evaluate for LUTD according to the relevant guidelines. The severity and bother of individual LUTS should be identified with a symptom score, supplemented by directed questioning if needed. A validated bladder diary is mandatory.Review whether behavioural factors affecting fluid balance and sleep are contributing.Review of medical history and medications, including directed evaluation for key conditions, such as renal failure, diabetes mellitus, cardiac failure, and obstructive sleep apnoea. If systemic factors or sleep disorders are potentially important, consider involving appropriate medical expertise (see Figure 6). This is appropriate where a known condition is sub optimally managed, or symptoms and signs suggest an undiagnosed condition. Figure 5. Evaluation of Nocturia in non-neurogenic Male LUTS.  Assessment must establish whether the patient has polyuria, LUTS, a sleep disorder or a combination. Therapy may be driven by the bother it causes, but non-bothersome nocturia may warrant assessment with a frequency volume chart (indicated by the dotted line) depending on history and clinical examination since potential presence of a serious underlying medical condition must be considered.FVC = frequency volume chart; DRE = digital rectal examination; NP = nocturnal polyuria; MoA = mechanism of action; PVR = post-void residual; PSA = prostate-specific antigen; US = ultrasound.
