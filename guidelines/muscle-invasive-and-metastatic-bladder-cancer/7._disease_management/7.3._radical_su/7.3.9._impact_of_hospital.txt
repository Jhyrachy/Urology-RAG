7.3.9. Impact of hospital and surgeon volume on treatment outcomes. In a systematic review including 40 retrospective studies with 56,000 patients, the impact of hospital and/or surgeon volume and peri-operative outcomes of RC was assessed [410]. A higher hospital volume was associated with lower in-hospital, 30-day and 90-day mortality. In addition, higher volume hospitals were more likely to have lower positive surgical margins, higher number of LNDs and neobladders and lower complication rates. For surgeon volume, less evidence was available. This study suggested performing at least 10 RCs per centre annually and preferably more than 20. Recently, a nationwide analysis of the Dutch Cancer Registry including almost 9,500 patients between 2008 and 2018 reported decreased 30- and 90-day mortality rates for annual hospital volumes of > 30 RCs. Furthermore, this study showed no true plateau curve for 30- and 90-day mortality beyond 30 RCs supporting the ‘more is better’ principle [411,412].
