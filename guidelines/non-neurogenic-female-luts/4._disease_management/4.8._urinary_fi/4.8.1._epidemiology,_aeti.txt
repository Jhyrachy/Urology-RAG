4.8.1. Epidemiology, aetiology and pathophysiology. 4.8.1.1. Obstetric fistula According to the WHO, fistulae affect > 2 million women, mostly from sub-Saharan African and Asian countries. The pooled prevalence of fistula from population studies is 0.29/1000 pregnancies [669]. Poor quality obstetric care, staff unaccountability, late referral, and poor nursing standards have been identified as health system causes [669]. However, obstructed labour is poorly documented. The main individual risk factors include age at first marriage, short stature, pregnancy with a male child, failure to attend antenatal care, low socio-economic status, low social class, lack of employment, and illiteracy [670-672]. Obstetric fistulae have detrimental consequences on global and individual health and are associated with malnutrition, sexual dysfunction, anxiety, depression, insomnia, social isolation, worsening poverty, and suicide [673,674]. 4.8.1.2. Iatrogenic fistula Poor obstetric care is usually responsible for VVFs in the developing world. By contrast, in the developed world, gynaecological or pelvic surgery is the main cause of VVF. In a recent French epidemiological study, pelvic surgery accounted for two thirds of VVF causes [675]. 4.8.1.2.1. Post-gynaecological surgery An injury to the urinary tract during hysterectomy for benign conditions (60–75%), hysterectomy for malignant conditions (30%) and caesarean section (6%) are the main causes of postoperative VVF in the developed world [676,677]. The risk of pelvic organ fistula following hysterectomy ranges from 0.1-4% [678]. Fistulae may also occur as a result of primary or recurrent malignancy, or as a consequence of cancer treatment by surgery, radiotherapy, and/or chemotherapy. In a study including 536 women undergoing radical hysterectomy for invasive cervical cancer, bladder injury occurred in 1.5% with VVFs forming in 2.6% and uretero-vaginal fistulae (UVFs) in 2.4% of cases [679]. Overall, the rate of urogenital fistula appears to be ~9 times higher following radical hysterectomy for malignant disease as compared to that following simple hysterectomy (abdominal or vaginal for benign conditions) [680]. Bladder-sparing techniques during pelvic exenteration can increase the risk of fistula formation [681]. 4.8.1.2.2. Radiation fistula The risk of fistula seems to be higher for postoperative external beam radiation (1.9%) compared to intravaginal brachytherapy (0.8%) [682], without any predictive factor being identified [683]. This is most likely due to the heterogeneity of data regarding the tumour type and stage, the form of radiation, and the site and dose delivered. 4.8.1.2.3. Rare causes of vesico-vaginal fistula Foreign bodies such as pessaries, sex toys, cups etc. can be a cause of delayed presentation of VVF [684-686]. Ketamine abuse has also been shown to be responsible for fistula formation [687]. 4.8.1.3. Summary of evidence for epidemiology, aetiology, and pathophysiology of urinary fistula Summary of evidenceLEThe risk of injury to the urinary tract and subsequent fistula formation is higher in women with malignant disease undergoing radical surgery than in women with benign disease undergoing simple surgical procedures.2The rate of fistula formation following external beam radiotherapy for gynaecological cancer appears to be of the same order as that following surgical treatment.4
