3.16.2.8. Prostate biopsy. 3.16.2.8.1. Transperineal prostate biopsy A total of eight randomised studies including 1,596 patients compared the impact of biopsy route on infectious complications. Infectious complications were significantly higher following transrectal biopsy (48 events among 789 men) compared to transperineal biopsy (22 events among 807 men), [RR (95% CIs) 2.48 (1.47 to 4.2) [553,554]. In addition, a systematic review including 165 studies with 162,577 patients described sepsis rates of 0.1% and 0.9% for transperineal and transrectal biopsies, respectively [555]. Finally, a population-based study from the UK (n=73,630) showed lower re-admission rates for sepsis in patients who had transperineal versus transrectal biopsies (1.0% vs, 1.4%, respectively) [556]. The available evidence demonstrates that the transrectal approach should be abandoned in favour of the transperineal approach despite any possible logistical challenges. A systematic review and meta-analysis of eight non-RCTs reported no significant differences between patients receiving or not receiving antibiotic prophylaxis in terms of post-biopsy infection (0.11% vs. 0.31%) and sepsis (0.13% vs. 0.09%), for the transperineal approach [557]. This is in line with another systematic review and meta-analysis of 112 individual patient cohorts which also showed no significant difference in the number of patients experiencing post-transperineal biopsy infection with 1.35% of 29,880 patients receiving antibiotic prophylaxis and 1.22% of 4,772 not receiving antibiotic prophylaxis (p=0.8) [558]. In addition, two recently published RCTs have reported comparably low post-biopsy infection rates for transperineal biopsy regardless of whether antibiotic prophylaxis was administered or not [559,560]. There is a growing body of evidence to suggest that antibiotic prophylaxis may not be required for transperineal biopsy; however, the Panel have chosen to wait until a number of ongoing RCTs report their study findings before making a recommendation on this. 3.16.2.8.2. Transrectal prostate biopsy An updated meta-analysis of eleven RCTs including 2,237 men showed that use of a rectal povidone-iodine preparation before biopsy, in addition to antimicrobial prophylaxis, resulted in a significantly lower rate of infectious complications [RR (95% CIs) 0.47 (0.36 to 0.61) [553,561-563]. Single RCTs showed no evidence of benefit for perineal skin disinfection [564], but reported an advantage for rectal povidone-iodine preparation before biopsy compared to after biopsy [565]. A meta-analysis of four RCTs including 671 men evaluated the use of rectal preparation by enema before transrectal biopsy. No significant advantage was found regarding infectious complications [RR (95% CIs) 0.96 (0.64 to 1.54) [553]. An updated meta-analysis of 29 RCTs with 4,127 patients found no evidence that use of peri-prostatic injection of local anaesthesia resulted in more infectious complications than no injection [RR (95% CIs) 1.08 (0.80 to 1.49)] [553,554,566,567]. An updated meta-analysis of 10 RCTs including 2,342 patients found that extended biopsy templates showed comparable infectious complications to standard templates [RR (95% CIs) 0.82 (0.55 to 1.24)] [553,568]. Additional meta-analyses found no difference in infections complications regarding needle guide type (disposable vs. reusable), needle type (coaxial vs. non-coaxial), needle size (large vs. small), and number of injections for peri-prostatic nerve block (standard vs. extended) [553]. A meta-analysis of eleven studies with 1,753 patients showed significantly reduced infections after transrectal prostate biopsy when using antimicrobial prophylaxis as compared to placebo/control [RR (95% CIs) 0.56 (0.40 to 0.77)] [569]. Fluoroquinolones have been traditionally used for antibiotic prophylaxis in this setting; however, overuse and misuse of fluoroquinolones has resulted in an increase in fluoroquinolone resistance. In addition, the European Commission has implemented stringent regulatory conditions regarding the use of fluoroquinolones resulting in the suspension of the indication for peri-operative antibiotic prophylaxis including prostate biopsy [138]. A systematic review and meta-analysis on antibiotic prophylaxis for the prevention of infectious complications following prostate biopsy concluded that in countries where fluoroquinolones are allowed as antibiotic prophylaxis, a minimum of a full one-day administration is recommended [569]. An updated meta-analysis of eight RCTs with 2,939 patients confirmed that targeted therapy (antibiotic guidance based on rectal swab microbiology) in case of fluoroquinolone resistance is associated with reduced infectious complications [RR (95% CIs) 0.54 (0.40 to 0.72)] [569]. In addition, an updated meta-analysis of ten RCTs with 2,787 patients comparing augmented prophylaxis (combination of two or more different classes of antibiotics) to standard prophylaxis showed augmented prophylaxis to be superior [RR (95% CIs) 0.44 (0.32 to 0.59)] [569,570]. In countries where use of fluoroquinolones are suspended cephalosporins or aminoglycosides can be used as individual agents with comparable infectious complications based on meta-analysis of two RCTs [569]. An updated meta-analysis of four RCTs compared fosfomycin trometamol to fluoroquinolones [RR (95% CIs) 0.62 (0.37 to 1.06)] [569,571]. Although initial RCTs suggested fosfomycin trometamol to be superior the latest Swedish study, which aimed to recruit 3,448 patients, was discontinued after 42 patients due to the unusually high number of hospitalisations in the fosfomycin trometamol group [571]. Therefore, routine general use should be critically assessed due to the relevant infectious complications also reported in non-randomised studies [572]. Of note the indication of fosfomycin trometamol for prostate biopsy has been withdrawn in Germany as the manufacturers did not submit the necessary pharmacokinetic data in support of this indication. Urologists are advised to check their local guidance in relation to the use of fosfomycin trometamol for prostate biopsy. Another possibility is the use of augmented prophylaxis without fluoroquinolones, although no standard combination has been established to date. Finally, targeted prophylaxis based on rectal swap/stool culture is plausible, but no RCTs are available on non-fluoroquinolones. See figure 1 for prostate biopsy workflow to reduce infections complications.
