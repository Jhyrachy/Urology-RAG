3.16.2.4. Transurethral resection of the prostate. A systematic review of 39 RCTs with search date up to 2009 was identified [548]. The update search to February 2017 did not reveal any further relevant studies. Of the 39 RCTs reviewed by Dahm et al., six trials involving 1,666 men addressed the risk of septic episodes, 17 trials reported procedure related fever and 39 investigated bacteriuria. Use of prophylactic antibiotics compared to placebo showed a relative risk reduction (95% CI) for septic episode of 0.51 (0.27-0.96) with ARR of 2% (3.4% - 1.4%) and a NNT of 50. The risk reduction (95% CI) for fever was 0.64 (0.55-0.75) and 0.37 (0.32-0.41) for bacteriuria.
