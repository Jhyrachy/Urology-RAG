6.1. prevalence, aetiology, risk factors bladder stones. bladder stones constitute approximately 5% urinary tract stones yet responsible 8% urolithiasis-related mortalities developed nations . incidence higher developing countries . prevalence bladder stones higher males, reported male-to-female ratio 10:1 4:1 . age distribution bimodal: incidence peaks three years children developing countries , 60 years adulthood . aetiology bladder stones typically multi-factorial . bladder stones classified primary, secondary, migratory . primary endemic bladder stones occur absence urinary tract pathology, typically seen children areas poor hydration, recurrent diarrhoea, diet deficient animal protein . secondary bladder stones occur presence urinary tract abnormalities, include bladder outlet obstruction (boo), neurogenic bladder dysfunction, chronic bacteriuria, foreign bodies (including catheters), bladder diverticula, bladder augmentation urinary diversion. adults, boo common predisposing factor bladder stone formation accounts 45-79% vesical calculi [705,709-712]. migratory bladder stones passed upper urinary tract formed may serve nidus bladder stone growth. patients bladder calculi likely history upper tract stones risk factors formation . wide range metabolic urinary abnormalities pre-dispose calculi anywhere urinary tract, covered detail section 4. metabolic evaluation recurrence prevention. paucity studies specific metabolic abnormalities predispose bladder stones. bladder stones form 3-4.7% men undergoing surgery benign prostatic obstruction (bpo) , 19-39% 36-67% motor-incomplete motor-complete spinal cord injury patients, respectively , 2.2% patients long-term catheters . two research groups identified larger intravesical protrusion prostrate independent risk factor bladder stone formation patients bph undergoing turp . kim colleagues additionally found older age lower qmax predictive bladder stones . men chronic urinary retention secondary bpo, 24-hour urine 27 men bladder stones higher uric acid supersaturation (2.2 vs. 0.6 mmol/l, p < 0.01), lower magnesium (106 vs. 167 mmol/l, p = 0.01) lower ph (5.9 vs. 6.4, p = 0.02) 21 men without bladder stones . therefore likely patients conditions form bladder stones also abnormal urine composition predisposes bladder stone formation. metabolic abnormalities predispose patients form secondary bladder stones poorly understood. stone analysis 86 men bpo-related bladder stone demonstrated 42% calcium-based stones (oxalate, phosphate), 33% magnesium ammonium phosphate, 10% mixed stones 14% urate stones . similar findings reported recent studies [720-722] therefore likely multiple metabolic factors predispose patients secondary bladder stone formation. low urine volume (poor hydration) consistently demonstrable abnormality [723-725]. outlet obstruction often absent children adults, aetiology likely quite different population. twenty-four-hour urine analysis children endemic bladder stones reported two studies. 57 children pakistan, 89.5% hypocitraturia, 49% low urine volume, 44% hyperoxaluria 42% hypocalciuria . 61 children india, stone formers higher urine calcium uromucoid concentrations controls . one study thailand compared 24-hour urine analyses children rural area high prevalence bladder stones urban area: rural children lower urine volumes and, despite equal calcium, oxalate, uric acid concentrations, crystalluria uric acid calcium oxalate crystals prevalent rural children . table 6.1 bladder stones classified aetiology. type bladder stoneprimarysecondarymigratorycause/associationsoccur absence urinary tract pathology, typically children areas poor hydration, recurrent diarrhoea, diet deficient animal proteinboo (e.g., bpo, urethral stricture)form upper urinary tract, passed bladder may nidus stone growthneurogenic bladderdysfunctionchronic bacteriuriaforeign bodies (includingcatheters)bladder diverticulabladder augmentationurinary diversion boo = bladder outlet obstruction; bpo = benign prostatic obstruction.
