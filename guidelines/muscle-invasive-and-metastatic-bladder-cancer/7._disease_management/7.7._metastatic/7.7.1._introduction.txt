7.7.1. Introduction. The treatment of metastatic UC had remained largely unchanged since pivotal trials published over 20 years ago set the standard of care for first-line treatment with cisplatin-based combinations demonstrating an OS benefit. This longstanding paradigm was challenged in the past years by the introduction of immunotherapy using checkpoint inhibitors and it was finally upended in October 2023 with the presentation of the results of two practice-changing randomised clinical trials (RCTs) demonstrating an overall survival benefit in the first line setting against platinum-based chemotherapy (EV-302/KEYNOTE A39 and Checkmate 901) [487,488]. These updated guidelines reflect the results of these two trials and the impact for first and later lines management of patients with metastatic bladder cancer.
