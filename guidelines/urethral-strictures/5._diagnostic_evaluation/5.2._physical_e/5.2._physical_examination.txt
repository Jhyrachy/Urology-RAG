5.2. Physical examination. The abdomen should be examined for the presence of a palpable bladder. The location of any suprapubic tube should be noted to assess its potential utility for antegrade cystoscopy or the placement of a sound (to facilitate repair) [156]. Examination of the genitalia should note the presence of foreskin, the position and size of the meatus as well as any evidence of scarring suggestive of LS. Pre-operative biopsy to confirm LS may be performed if this alters management and is essential if malignancy is suspected [157]. The presence of penile or perineal fistulae should be noted. The urethra should be palpated to assess for induration suggestive of significant fibrosis. Rarely a mass may signify a urethral carcinoma. A rectal examination to assess for prostatic pathology, which may be the cause of urinary symptoms, should be undertaken. In patients with posterior urethral stenosis rectal adherence to the prostate and the mobility of the surrounding tissues should be assessed [158]. The oral cavity should be examined for the suitability of oral mucosa. Measurement of BMI will identify obese individuals who are at greater risk of leg compartment syndrome when placed in the lithotomy position for a prolonged time period [159]. Assessing hip mobility is important when considering an exaggerated lithotomy position as some patients may have limited hip flexion due to unresolved orthopaedic problems [156].
