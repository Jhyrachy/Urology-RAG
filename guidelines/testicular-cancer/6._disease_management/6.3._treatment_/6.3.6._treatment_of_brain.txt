6.3.6. Treatment of brain metastases. Brain metastases occur in the context of initial metastatic disease, systemic relapse and rarely as an isolated site of relapse. Long-term survival of patients presenting with brain metastases at diagnosis is poor (30-50%) and even poorer when a site of recurrent disease (five-year survival-rate is 2-5%) [268,269]. A large international database comprising 523 patients reported 48% three-year OS rates in patients with brain metastases at initial diagnosis and 27% three-year OS rates for patients with brain metastases at relapse [58]. Chemotherapy as initial treatment proved effective in a first-line setting (potentially even as dose-intensified therapy upfront) with data also supporting the use of multimodal treatment particularly in relapsed disease [58]. Consolidation RT, even with total response after chemotherapy, should therefore be used in patients with brain metastases at relapse, but must be carefully discussed in a first-line setting [270]. Surgery may be considered in cases with a persistent solitary metastasis, depending on the systemic disease status, histology of the primary tumour and the location of the metastasis. 6.3.6.1. Summary of evidence and recommendations for the treatment of metastatic testicular germ cell tumours Summary of evidenceLEIn the NSGCT good-prognosis-risk group (IGCCG), BEP x 3 is superior to other chemotherapy regimens. Toxicity is lower when treatment is delivered in five-day regimes rather than three-day regimes.1bIn the NSGCT intermediate-prognosis-risk group (IGCCCG) BEP x 4 is the standard treatment of choice with a five-year survival of 89% in contemporary series.1bIn pathological stage II NSGCT disease, RPLND performed in specialised centres without adjuvant chemotherapy results in 73-81% of long-lasting remissions.2bIn patients with a poor-prognosis metastatic NSGCT (defined by IGCCCG), treatment with BEP x 4, results in a five-year PFS of 67%. There is no advantage in OS for high-dose chemotherapy.1bPatients with a poor-prognosis metastatic NSGCT and early unfavourable tumour marker decline may benefit from intensification of treatment with dose-dense chemotherapy, with improvement of PFS despite no benefit being observed for OS.1bFollowing first-line BEP chemotherapy, 6-10% of NSGCT residual masses contain active cancer, 50% have post-pubertal teratoma, and 40% comprise of necrotic-fibrotic tissue only. Figures regarding persistence of residual active are slightly lower in post chemotherapy residual masses < 1 cm. Currently there is no accurate prognostication method of histology.2bIn CS IIA/B seminoma radiotherapy and chemotherapy treatment show similar effectiveness, with a non-significant trend towards greater efficacy of chemotherapy in CS IIB. However, risk of second malignancies and cardiovascular events is higher after radiotherapy.2aIn metastatic seminoma stage > IIC, primary chemotherapy with BEP, tailored to the IGCCCG risk group, has proven superior to Carboplatin based chemotherapy.1bFluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography has a high NPV in patients with post-chemotherapy seminoma residual masses (> 3 cm) when performed more than two months after chemotherapy.2b RecommendationsStrength ratingTreat low-volume non-seminomatous germ cell tumour (NSGCT) stage IIA/B with elevated markers like metastatic good- or intermediate-prognosis risk group IGCCCG with three or four cycles of cisplatin, etoposide, bleomycin (BEP).StrongNerve-sparing retroperitoneal lymph node dissection when performed by an experienced surgeon in a specialised centre is the recommended initial treatment in clinical stage (CS) IIA NSGCT disease without elevated tumour markers.WeakRepeat staging after six weeks before making a final decision on further management should be considered in patients with small volume (CS IIA < 2 cm) marker-negative NSGCT.WeakTreat metastatic NSGCT (stage > IIC) with an intermediate prognosis with four cycles of standard BEP.StrongTreat metastatic NSGCT with a poor prognosis and favourable marker decline with four cycles of BEP.StrongAssess tumour marker decline after one cycle of standard chemotherapy in metastatic NSGCT with a poor-prognosis. With unfavourable decline, consider chemotherapy intensification.WeakPerform surgical resection of visible (> 1 cm in longest diameter) residual masses after chemotherapy for NSGCT when serum levels of tumour markers are normal or normalising.StrongOffer cisplatin chemotherapy according to IGCCCG prognosis groups, or alternatively radiotherapy to seminoma patients with stage II A/B and, inform the patient of potential long-term side effects of both treatment options.WeakTreat seminoma stage IIC and higher, with primary chemotherapy according to IGCCCG classification (BEP x 3 in good-prognosis and BEP x 4 in intermediate prognosis).Strong
