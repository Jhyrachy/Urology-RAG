ies represent “real world” data, including all levels of surgical experience and surgical volumes whereas the meta-analysis is based on clinical studies. Thus, the better outcomes for robotic RP in the population studies may be related to the shorter learning curve [106]. d.3.1 Risk factors for development of vesicourethral anastomosis strictures These include higher grade cancer, more advanced stage, higher prostate volume, coronary artery disease, obesity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, previous bladder outlet surgery and older age [99,107,108]. Surgical factors include the use of non-nerve-sparing technique, anastomotic urine leak, increased operative time and increased estimated blood loss [99,107,108]. In addition, low-volume surgeons (< 40/year) were shown to have higher VUAS rates, 27.7%, compared to high-volume surgeons (> 40/year), 22% [109]. d.3.2 Interventions to prevent vesicourethral anastomosis strictures Srougi et al., studied bladder neck mucosal eversion in a prospective RCT of 95 patients. No significant difference was found in rates of VUAS at twelve months follow-up [110]. A meta-analysis by Kowelewski et al., comparing interrupted vs. continuous vesico-urethral anastomosis suturing found no difference in VUAS rates [111]. Another SR by Bai et al., compared barbed sutures to conventional sutures, and although heterogeneity across studies precluded meta-analysis, no patients developed VUAS with either approach [112]. d.4 Prostate radiation and ablative treatments Urethral strictures occur in 1.5% of patients undergoing external beam radiation therapy (EBRT), 1.9% having brachytherapy (BT) and 4.9% who receive combination EBRT-BT at around four years follow-up [113]. These strictures typically occur in the bulbomembranous urethra [114]. As opposed to RP, stricture incidence after irradiation increases with time [100,113]. For the ablative treatments, the stricture incidence after cryotherapy and high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is 1.1-3.3% and 10.3%, respectively [100,115]. The use of these modalities in the salvage setting is associated with increased risk of stricture formation: 3-10% after salvage EBRT, 5-12% after salvage cryotherapy and 15-30% after salvage HIFU [100]. Due to the increasing utilisation of prostate irradiation (EBRT, BT) and ablative treatments (cryotherapy, HIFU), an increasing number of respectively radiation-induced and ablative treatment-induced strictures are expected [116]. d.4.1 Risk factors for the development of radiation strictures Awad et al., performed a multivariate meta-regression analysis including 46 studies, finding combining ERBT + BT and length of follow-up to be significant predictors of urethral stricture following prostate radiation [113]. Factors not shown to predict urethral stricture included biochemical equivalent dose, age, and androgen deprivation therapy [113]. Previous TURP was not included in the analysis, but has been found to be an independent predictor of stricture (HR: 2.81) in a previous multivariate analysis from a single institution [117] as well as PSA level < 10 ng/ml (HR: 0.47) [118]. d.4.2 Interventions to prevent radiation induced urethral strictures Delaying adjuvant or salvage EBRT by nine months is associated with lower rates of urethral stricture (HR: 0.6) [119]. This has to be balanced with risk of delaying treatment in terms of cancer control [77]. In BT, it has been reported that downward movement of needle applicators occurs between fractions [120]. This may explain why strictures occur below the prostatic apex [118] in the so called “hot spot” [121]. Several measures taken together are thought to have contributed to a reduction in urethral stricture formation with BT including reduction of dose to the “hot spot”, more careful needle placement, avoiding midline insertion and the introduction of plastic needles rather than steel [113]. e. Failed hypospadias repair Although urethral strictures after hypospadias repair are sometimes considered as iatrogenic [36], they are a very specific subtype and should be considered as a separate entity. The main reasons for this are the absence of spongiosus tissue at different levels within the penile urethral segment, and the lack of high-quality local tissues for urethral reconstruction [122]. f. Congenital The diagnosis of a congenital urethral stricture can only be made in the absence of other possible aetiology, such as iatrogenic, inflammatory, and traumatic causes [123]. Congenital strictures are thought to be consequent to incomplete or incorrect fusion of the urethra formed from the urogenital sinus with the urethra formed following closure of the urethral folds. They typically have a deep bulbar location and are usually short. In general, congenital strictures are diagnosed at a young age (Moorman’s ring or Cobb’s collar). g. Idiopathic Idiopathic strictures are seen in 34% of all penile strictures and in 63% of all bulbar strictures [124]. Unrecognised trauma is thought to be a possible aetiology of idiopathic urethral strictures [26].
