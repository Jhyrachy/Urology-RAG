6.3.5.1.2.2. Endoscopic incision/resection of non-traumatic posterior urethral stenosis (Table 6.8). Incisions can be performed at multiple locations according to surgeon’s preference [382]. However, aggressive incisions at the six and twelve o’clock positions should be avoided because of the risk of, respectively, rectal injury and urosymphyseal fistulation [189,383-385]. The risk of urosymphyseal fistulation is especially a concern after previous radiotherapy [386]. Result of bladder neck incision for VUAS are poorer after radiotherapy [387]. Direct vision internal urethrotomy is mainly performed in patients with primary or recalcitrant VUAS although one series performed it in a mix of patients with VUAS and BNS [388] and two series reported it for radiation-induced BMS [117,381]. Direct vision internal urethrotomy/ dilatation for non-irradiated BMS are usually included in series reporting on anterior strictures (see section 6.2 Male endoluminal treatment of anterior urethral strictures). Patency after a 1st “cold/hot knife” DVIU ranges between 25-80% [375,376,380,382,388-393]. Laser incision yields a 69-100% patency rate [376,380,394,395]. In a retrospective and unbalanced series, La Bossiere et al., found better patency rates for laser incision as compared to dilatation, “cold knife” DVIU and transurethral resection (TUR) [376]. Redshaw et al., reported inferior patency rates for “cold knife” incision vs. “hot knife” incision followed by MMC for BNS (50 vs. 63%; p=0.03) [236] (see supplementary Table S6.13). Urinary incontinence largely varies between 0 and 53% but some series have not assessed urinary continence before DVIU [389,391]. In series where pre- DVIU continence data were available, de novo urinary continence after DVIU ranges between 0% and 10% [375,380,390,392,394]. Noteworthy, of 21 patients that were incontinent pre-DVIU in the series of Giannarini et al., eleven (52%) patients became continent, and eight (38%) patients experienced improvement after DVIU [390]. As most recurrences will occur early [390,391], it is advised to wait for three to four months after DVIU [382,391,396] to proceed with incontinence surgery, if necessary, although others wait for twelve months [397]. The presence of recurrence must be ruled out by cystoscopy prior to incontinence surgery [382,391,396,397]. Another option is to resect the stenosis. Popken et al., reported a 47% patency rate with TUR for untreated VUAS and no patient suffered de novo SUI [392]. Kranz et al., compared the results of TUR in 87 and 60 patients with, respectively, VUAS after RP and BNS after TURP. After a median follow-up of 27 (range: 1-98) months, patency rate was 40.2% for VUAS and 58.3% for BNS (p=0.031). The rate of de novo incontinence was significantly higher in patients treated for VUAS compared to BNS (13.8 vs. 1.7%; p=0.011) [398]. There is conflicting evidence whether resection is associated with higher incontinence rate compared to incision [379,399].  Brodak et al., compared TUR by bipolar resection (n=22) with holmium laser incision and vaporisation (n=17). After a mean follow-up of 42 months, two (9.1%) and four (23.5%) patients suffered a recurrence with bipolar and laser resection respectively (p=0.37). After six months, patients treated with bipolar resection had a significant better Qmax compared to laser treatment (13 vs. 6.1 ml/s; p < 0.001) [395]. Bipolar plasma vaporisation produced an 82% patency rate at a mean 24-month follow-up in 28 patients with VUAS who previously failed endoscopic treatment [400]. Cut-to-the-light technique for a complete obliterative stricture is not advised because of the very-low likelihood of durable patency and for the risk of false passage towards the rectum [396,401,402]. Repeat DVIU was often able to stabilise the stricture [117,375,376,381,388-390,398], but ultimately 6-10% required urinary diversion [391] or chronic suprapubic cystostomy [381,388]. Transurethral resection can be performed for prostatic obstruction due to sloughing after high-energy treatments (HIFU, cryoablation) [100]. Transurethral resection for obstructive necrotic debris after radiotherapy is possible but is of limited role. Risk of recurrence is 50% and risk of de novo UI is 15-25% [100].
