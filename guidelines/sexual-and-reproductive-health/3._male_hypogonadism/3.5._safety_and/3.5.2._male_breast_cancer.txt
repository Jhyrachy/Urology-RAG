3.5.2. Male breast cancer. Studies have documented that breast cancer growth is significantly influenced by testosterone and/or by its conversion to oestradiol (E2) through different mechanisms and pathways [125]. Accordingly, the use of SERMs still represents an important therapeutic option in the management of this cancer [125]. No information is available on the role of testosterone therapy in patients successfully treated for male breast cancer; therefore, treated and active male breast cancer should be recognised as absolute contraindications for testosterone therapy.
