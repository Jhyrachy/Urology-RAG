6.2.1.2. Indications of “hot-knife” direct vision internal urethrotomy. 6.2.1.2.1. Laser urethrotomy Lasers available for urological applications, including Neodymium:YAG, Argon, Holmium:YAG, Potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP) and Tm:Yag, have been used for the treatment of urethral strictures. A SR identified four RCTs comparing laser urethrotomy and the “cold knife” urethrotomy. All studies were limited by short-term outcome evaluation and none of these four studies specified the results based on the location of the stricture. Two of these studies reported specific recurrence rates and meta-analysis showed a relative risk (RR) for recurrence of 0.55 (95% CI: 0.18-1.66; p=0.29), 0.39 (95% CI: 0.19-0.81; p=0.01) and 0.44 (95% CI: 0.26-0.75; p=0.003) in favour of laser urethrotomy after three, six and twelve months respectively [210]. Jin et al., performed a SR including 44 case series on laser urethrotomy or “cold knife” DVIU [211]. This included nineteen articles on laser urethrotomy and 25 articles on “cold knife” DVIU. The overall weighted average stricture-free rate was 74.9% (371/495) and 68.5% (1874/2735) for laser vs. “cold knife” DVIU, respectively (p=0.004). Although statistically significant, the results must be interpreted with caution because of heterogeneity and because no details are provided on follow-up duration. Specifically looking at first DVIU, laser and “cold knife” DVIU obtained a stricture-free rate of 58.6% and 42.7%, respectively and the difference was no longer statistically significant (p=0.09). At the bulbar urethra, laser and “cold knife” DVIU yielded a stricture-free rate of 52.9% and 60%, respectively (p=0.66) [211]. After publication of this SR, the EAU Guideline Panel scope search identified three additional RCTs [212-214]. In the RCT of Yenice et al., patients with a primary, bulbar stricture were randomised either to “cold knife” DVIU (n=29) or holmium:YAG laser urethrotomy (n=34). After twelve months follow-up, no significant difference in patency rate was identified (79% for “cold knife” DVIU vs. 68% for laser urethrotomy, p=0.3) [213]. In their RCT, Chen et al., reported a better patency rate after one year with laser (n=24) compared to “cold knife” (n=22) DVIU (respectively 88% vs. 18%; p < 0.05). However, after two years the benefit for laser disappeared and after five years both techniques showed a low patency rate: 9% for “cold knife” DVIU vs. 12% for laser DVIU (p > 0.05) [212]. Gamal et al., randomized patients between “cold knife” DVIU (n=40) and Holmium:Yag laser DVIU (n=40). At one year, they found an equally effective improvement of maximum urinary flow in both groups. 6.2.1.2.2. Plasmakinetic (bipolar) urethrotomy Cecen et al., conducted an RCT comparing plasmakinetic with “cold knife” DVIU (n=136) [215]. They reported patency rates for plasmakinetic and “cold knife” urethrotomy at nine months in respectively 86% and 70% of cases (p=0.025). At eighteen months, patency rates for plasmakinetic and “cold knife” urethrotomy were 63% and 67%, respectively (p=0.643) [215]. A prospective cohort study on primary strictures < 2 cm reported a patency rate at twelve months in 23/30 (77%) cases for plasmakinetic DVIU vs. 19/30 (63%) cases with “cold knife” DVIU (p=0.04) [216]. A retrospective case series (n=27) reported a 74% patency rate for short (1-2.5 cm) strictures after a mean follow-up of fourteen months [217]. They reported negligible blood loss during the procedure and no post-operative incontinence. Based on the conflicting results described above and considering the heterogeneity of series and absence of long-term follow-up, overall, the available studies do not support the efficacy of one technique of DVIU over another. Given the similar complication rates between techniques (see section 6.2.1.3), no recommendation can be made in favour of one technique over another.
