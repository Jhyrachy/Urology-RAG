8.3.1. Long-term (> twelve months) quality of life outcomes in men with localised disease. 8.3.1.1. Men undergoing local treatments In the updated results of the ProtecT trial [1444] treatment-received analyses revealed different impacts of treatments over six1398042195years. Men remaining on AM experienced gradual declines in sexual and urinary function with age with increases in ED from 35% at baseline to 53% at six1398042195years and nocturia from 20% to 38%. Radical treatment impacts were immediate and continued over six1398042195years. After RP, 95% reported ED persisting for 85% at six1398042195years, after EBRT this was 69% and 74%, respectively (p1398042195<13980421950.001 compared with AM). After RP, 36% reported urinary leakage requiring at least one1398042195pad/day, persisting for 20% at six1398042195years, compared with no change in men receiving EBRT or AM (p1398042195<13980421950.001). Worse bowel function and bother such as bloody stools 6% at six1398042195years and faecal incontinence 10%, was experienced by more men after EBRT than after RP or AM (p1398042195<13980421950.001) with lesser effects after BT. No treatment affected mental or physical QoL. In another paper on the twelve years outcome this trial [1364], it was seen that the generic quality-of-life scores were similar in randomised groups over seven to twelve years, urinary leakage requiring pads occurred in 18-24% of patients In the prostatectomy group over seven to twelve years, compared with 9-11% in the AM group and 3-8% in the radiotherapy group. Erections sufficient for intercourse were reported in 18% at seven years in the prostatectomy group, compared with 30% in the AM and 27% in the radiotherapy groups; all converged to low levels of potency by year twelve. Nocturia (voiding at least twice per night) occurred in 34% in the prostatectomy group compared with 48% in the radiotherapy group and 47% in the AM group at twelve years. Faecal leakage affected 12% in the radiotherapy group compared with 6% in the other groups by year twelve. The AM group experienced gradual age-related declines in sexual and urinary function, avoiding radical treatment effects unless they changed management. Other observational studies [668,1243,1354,1445-1448] also report findings regarding RP and RT. The Prostate Cancer Outcomes Study (PCOS) studied a cohort of 1,655 men, of whom 1,164 had undergone RP and 491 RT [1354]. The study reported that at five years of follow-up, men who underwent RP had a higher prevalence of urinary incontinence and ED, while men treated with RT had a higher prevalence of bowel dysfunction. However, despite these differences detected at five years, there were no significant differences in the adjusted odds of urinary incontinence, bowel dysfunction or ED between RP and RT at fifteen years. Investigators have reported that although EBRT was associated with a negative effect in bowel function, the difference in bowel domain score was below the threshold for clinical significance twelve months after treatment [1365]. As 81% of patients in the EBRT arm of the study received IMRT, these data suggest that the risk of side effects is reduced with IMRT compared to older 3D-CRT techniques. This is supported by five-year prospective, population-based cohort study where PROMs were compared in men with favourable- and unfavourable-risk localised disease [1447]. In the 1,386 men with favourable risk, comparison between AS and nerve-sparing prostatectomy, EBRT or LDR BT demonstrates that surgery is associated with worse urinary incontinence at five years and sexual dysfunction at three years when compared to AS. External beam RT is associated with changes not clinically different from AS, and LDR BT is associated with worse irritative urinary-, bowel- and sexual symptoms at one year. In 619 men with high-risk localised disease, comparison between non-nerve sparing RP and EBRT with ADT demonstrates that surgery is associated with worse urinary incontinence and sexual function through five years. A SR demonstrates that the risk of post-radiotherapy ED has reduced to a median of 25% at two years with utilisation of IMRT and is now similar to that noted after LDR BT [1449]. A few prospective studies have reported specific long-term urinary functional outcomes after RP and RT even if the studies are not comparative between the two treatment modalities. Considering incontinence and ED after RP the prospective randomised PIVOT trial, comparing RP to observation, reported that 40% of men wore pads, of which 20% wore more than > one pad/day, and an increased rate of ED in the RP group as compared to observation from 70% to approximately 87%, after a median follow-up of 12.7 years [1243]. The corresponding figures from the prospective non-randomised LAPPRO-trial, comparing open- to robot-assisted RP, were 27–29% of the patients reporting urinary incontinence of some degree after eight years and 66–70% reporting ED [1448]. Data on urinary, sexual and bowel function after RT has been reported from the HYPO-RT-PC-trial, a prospective randomised non-inferiority trial comparing ultra-HFX to conventional fractionation RT. In this trial 52–55% of the patients reported urinary problems (RTOG toxicity grade ≥ 1) at five years, of which 4.2–4.7% reported a RTOG grade ≥ 3 urinary morbidity and 7–8% reported moderate-to-severe incontinence at six years. Bowel toxicity of any level (RTOG toxicity grade ≥ 1) was reported in 53–54% of the patients at five years, of which 1.5–1.9% reported a RTOG grade ≥ 3 bowel morbidity, and 66–71% reported to have little or no erection without aids after six years follow-up [668,1446]. 8.3.1.2.
