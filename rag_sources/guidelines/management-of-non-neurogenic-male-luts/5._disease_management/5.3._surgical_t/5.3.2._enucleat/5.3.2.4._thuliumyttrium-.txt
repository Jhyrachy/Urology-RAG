5.3.2.4. thulium:yttrium-aluminium-garnet laser enucleation prostate. mechanism action: tm:yag laser described section 5.3.1.3. enucleation using tm:yag laser includes thulium vapoenucleation prostate (thuvep) thulium laser enucleation prostate (thulep) (blunt enucleation). (super) pulsed continuous wave (cw) thulium:yttrium-aluminium garnet (wavelength 2,013 nm) thulium fibre lasers (wavelength 1,940 nm) used laser enucleation prostate well absorbed water water-containing tissues. efficacy: two meta-analyses evaluating thulep vs. m-turp b-turp reported clinically relevant differences short-term efficacy (qmax, ipss qol score) . rct five years follow-up comparing thulep b-turp found difference two procedures qmax, ipss, pvr, qol . meta-analysis evaluating thulep vs. holep showed clinically relevant differences ipss, qol score qmax twelve months accordance one rct showing similar results eighteen months . furthermore, thulep pkep compared one rct twelve months follow-up difference regard efficacy . mainly prospective case studies thuvep showing significant improvement ipss, qmax, pvr treatment [429-432]. retrospective comparative series, differences (super)pulsed cw thulep regard intra-operative, peri-operative data clinical efficacy (qmax, ipss, qol) . tolerability safety: two meta-analyses evaluating thulep vs. m-turp b-turp reported longer operation time shorter catheterisation time thulep compared m-turp shorter hospitalisation time thulep compared b-turp . lower blood transfusion rates compared m-turp, lower clot retention rates compared b-turp, difference complication rates also reported thulep . one meta-analysis evaluating thulep vs. holep showed significant difference enucleation time favouring thulep, significant differences operation, catheterisation hospitalisation times, short-term complication rates. one rct showed urethral bladder neck strictures eighteen months thulep holep, respectively . thulep pkep compared one rct twelve months follow-up . significant difference complication rates detected, haemoglobin level decrease catheterisation time significantly lower thulep. rct comparing thulep b-turp reported significant difference iief-5 score favouring thulep twelve months . comparative studies thuvep shows high intra-operative safety , also case series patients large prostates anticoagulation bleeding disorders . study focusing post-operative complications thuvep reported adverse events 31% cases, 6.6% complications greater clavien grade 2 . one case control study thuvep 48 month follow-up reported long-term durability voiding improvements overall re-operation rates 2.4% . practical considerations: thulep seems offer similar efficacy safety compared turp, bipolar enucleation holep; whereas, thuvep supported rcts. based limited number rcts need ongoing investigation techniques . summary evidenceleenucleation prostate using tm:yag laser demonstrates similar efficacy compared m-turp/bipolar transurethral (plasmakinetic) enucleation, holep b-turp short-, mid-, long-term, respectively.1benucleation prostate using tm:yag laser (thulep) demonstrates similar safety compared turp/bipolar transurethral (plasmakinetic) enucleation, holep short- mid-term, respectively.1bvapoenucleation prostate using tm:yag laser (thuvep) seems safe patients large prostates receiving anticoagulant antiplatelet therapy.2b recommendationsstrength ratingoffer enucleation prostate using tm:yag laser (thulep, thuvep) men moderate-to-severe luts alternative transurethral resection prostate, holmium laser enucleation bipolar transurethral (plasmakinetic) enucleation.weakoffer tm:yag laser enucleation prostate patients receiving anticoagulant antiplatelet therapy.weak
