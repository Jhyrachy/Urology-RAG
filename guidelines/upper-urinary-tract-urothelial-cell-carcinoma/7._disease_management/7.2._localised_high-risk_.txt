7.2. Localised high-risk disease. 7.2.1. Radical nephroureterectomy 7.2.1.1. Surgical approach 7.2.1.1.1. Open radical nephroureterectomy Open RNU with bladder cuff excision is the standard treatment of high-risk UTUC, regardless of tumour location [13]. Radical nephroureterectomy must be performed according to oncological principles preventing tumour seeding [13]. Section 7.2.5 lists the recommendations for RNU. 7.2.1.1.2. Minimal invasive radical nephroureterectomy Retroperitoneal metastatic dissemination and metastasis along the trocar pathway following manipulation of large tumours in a pneumoperitoneal environment may occur [229,230]. Several precautions may lower the risk of tumour spillage: avoid entering the urinary tract, except when performing a bladder cuff excision and only after prior clipping of the ureter and complete drainage of the bladder;avoid direct contact between instruments and the tumour;perform the procedure in a closed system. Avoid morcellation of the tumour and use an endobag for tumour extraction;the kidney and ureter must be removed en bloc with the bladder cuff;in invasive or large (T3/T4 and/or N+/M+) tumours an open approach is favoured, as the oncological outcomes may be better compared to minimally-invasive RNU [231,232]. Laparoscopic RNU is safe in experienced hands when adhering to strict oncological principles. There is a tendency towards equivalent oncological outcomes after laparoscopic vs. open RNU [230,233-236]. One prospective randomised study has shown that laparoscopic RNU is inferior to open RNU for non-organ- confined UTUC. However, this was a small trial (n = 80) [232]. Oncological outcomes after RNU have not changed significantly over the past three decades despite staging and surgical refinements [237]. In a population-based data set, a hospital volume of > 6 patients per year treated with RNU showed improvement of short-term outcomes (30- and 90-day mortality) and overall long-term survival [238]. A robot-assisted laparoscopic approach can be considered allowing comparable peri operative benefit as standard laparoscopic surgery [239-241], with data suggesting oncologic equivalence with the other approaches [242-244]; however, the risk of intravesical recurrence may be increased with both laparoscopic and robotic RNU compared to the open approach [245]. 7.2.1.1.3. Bladder cuff management Resection of the distal ureter and its orifice is performed because there is a considerable risk of tumour recurrence in this area and in the bladder [22,216,246-248]. Several techniques have been considered to simplify distal ureter resection, including the pluck technique, stripping, transurethral resection of the intramural ureter, and intussusception. None of these techniques has convincingly been shown to be equal to complete bladder cuff excision [23,246]. 7.2.1.1.4. Lymph node dissection The use of a LND template is likely to have a greater impact on patient survival than the number of removed LNs [249]. Template-based and completeness of LND improves CSS in patients with muscle-invasive disease and reduces the risk of local recurrence [250]. Even in clinically [251] and pathologically [252] node-negative patients, LND improves survival. The risk of LN metastasis increases with advancing tumour stage [170]. Lymph node dissection appears to be unnecessary in cases of TaT1 UTUC because of the low risk of LN metastasis [253-256], however, tumour staging is inaccurate pre-operatively; therefore a template-based LND should be offered to all patients who are scheduled for RNU for high-risk UTUC. The templates for LND have been described [250,257,258]. 7.2.2. Distal ureterectomy Distal ureterectomy for high-risk UTUC in the distal ureter only seems to be associated with similar oncological outcomes as RNU [208,259]. This procedure can be performed with concomitant LN dissection. However, given the low level of evidence, this approach should only be currently used in highly selected cases where the benefits may be greater than the potential risks. 7.2.3. Kidney-sparing surgery for imperative indications Kidney-sparing surgery, including ureteroscopy or segmental ureterectomy, can be considered on a case-by- case basis for patients with high-risk UTUC with imperative indications such as solitary kidney, bilateral UTUC, severe chronic kidney disease or any other comorbidity compromising the use of RNU. However, there is a greater risk of progression after kidney-sparing surgery for high- vs. low-risk UTUC with a direct impact on survival [208]. 7.2.4. Peri-operative chemotherapy 7.2.4.1. Neoadjuvant treatments 7.2.4.1.1. Chemotherapy The primary advantage of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is the ability to give cisplatin-based regimens when patients still have maximal renal function. Several retrospective studies evaluating the role of NAC have shown evidence of pathological downstaging and complete response rates at RNU [180,260-263] with a direct impact on OS [194]. Furthermore, NAC has been shown to result in lower disease recurrence- and mortality rates compared to RNU alone, without compromising the use of definitive surgical treatment with a potential OS benefit [262,264-266]. No RCTs have been published yet but prospective data from phase II trials showed that NAC based on cisplatin combination therapy was associated with a 14 - 19% pathological complete response rate in high-grade and/or cT2-T4N0M0 UTUC [267,268]. In addition, final pathological stage was < ypT1 in more than 60% of included patients with acceptable toxicity profile. In a systematic review and meta-analysis comprising more than 800 patients, NAC has shown a pathologic partial response of 43% and a downstaging in 33% of patients, resulting in an OS and CSS survival benefit compared with RNU alone [269]. However, it is important to note that the evidence in the meta-analysis is not conclusive, given the significant bias and heterogeneity of the available data and the lack of distinction between truly neoadjuvant and downstaging chemotherapy. 7.2.4.1.2. Immunotherapy Only a small phase II study including 10 patients with high-risk UTUC evaluated the efficacy of pembrolizumab in the neoadjuvant setting [270]. However, no pathological response was observed and one treatment-related death was reported. Thus, there is currently no evidence to support the use of neoadjuvant immunotherapy for high-risk UTUC. 7.2.4.2. Adjuvant treatments 7.2.4.2.1. Bladder instillations The rate of bladder recurrence after RNU for UTUC is 22–47% [189,246]. Two prospective randomised trials [271,272] and two meta-analyses [273,274] have demonstrated that a single post-operative dose of intravesical chemotherapy (mitomycin C, pirarubicin) 2–10 days after surgery reduces the risk of bladder tumour recurrence within the first years post-RNU in patients without a history of BC. Prior to instillation, a cystogram can be considered in case of concerns about drug extravasation. All studies showed a very low risk of adverse events. Intravesical chemotherapy has also been safely given at the time of RNU prior to bladder cuff opening, removing the need for a post- operative cystogram, but with low level data for efficacy [275]. Based on current evidence it is unlikely that additional instillations beyond one peri-operative instillation of chemotherapy further substantially reduce the risk of intravesical recurrence [276]. Whilst there is no direct evidence supporting the use of intravesical chemotherapy instillation of chemotherapy after kidney-sparing surgery, single- dose chemotherapy might also be effective in that setting as well. Management is outlined in Figures 7.1 and 7.2. One low-level evidence study suggested that bladder irrigation might reduce the risk of bladder recurrence after RNU [277]. 7.2.4.2.2. Systemic Chemotherapy A phase III multicentre prospective RCT (n = 261) evaluating the benefit of four cycles of adjuvant gemcitabine-platinum combination chemotherapy initiated within 90 days after RNU vs. surveillance has reported a significant improvement in disease-free survival (DFS) in patients with pT2–pT4, N (any) or positive (pT any, N1–3) M0 UTUC (3 year DFS 71% vs 50%; 5 year DFS 63% vs 46%. HR 0.54 ; CI 0.36-0.79; 3 & 5 year MFS 19 % improvement HR 0.55 CI 0.0.36-0.77) [278]. Patients were stratified to gemcitabine/cisplatin or gemcitabine/carboplatin chemotherapy based on GFR alone with benefit seen irrespective of chemotherapy type. There was a non-significant trend towards improved OS (12% at 3 years) but as the study had met its primary endpoint of 3 year DFS, it closed early, leaving it underpowered for the secondary endpoint of OS. The main potential limitation of using adjuvant chemotherapy is the concern that renal function may deteriorate after RNU precluding cisplatin use in patients who could benefit from this [279,280]. A review of peri-operative predictors of decline in renal function after RNU showed three month GFR levels of around 50 mls/min [281]. With split dose and hydration cisplatin may be considered in patients with a GFR down to 45 mL/min. Table 2 outlines the eligibility criteria for platinum chemotherapy. In a retrospective study histological subtypes of UTUC exhibit different survival rates and adjuvant chemotherapy was only associated with an OS benefit in patients with pure UC [282]. However, whilst histological subtypes of UTUC exhibit different survival rates in retrospective studies, adjuvant chemotherapy should be considered where UC is the dominant pathology.

Immunotherapy In a phase III, multicentre, double-blind RCT involving patients with high-risk muscle-invasive UC who had undergone radical surgery (pT3, pT4a, or pN+), adjuvant nivolumab improved DFS compared to placebo in the intention-to-treat population (20.8 vs. 10.8 months) and among patients with a programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression level of 1% or more [283]. The patient population predominantly consisted of BC patients post- radical cystectomy, with an additional smaller cohort of patients with UTUC post-RNU. The median recurrence-free survival outside the urothelial tract in the entire intention-to-treat population was 22.9 months for nivolumab and 13.7 months for placebo. Treatment-related adverse events > grade 3 occurred in 17.9% of the nivolumab group and 7.2% of the placebo group. On subgroup analysis, patients with UTUC included in this study did not seem to benefit from adjuvant nivolumab, which requires further follow-up and analysis. Nonetheless, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved nivolumab as monotherapy for the adjuvant treatment of patients with muscle-invasive UC with tumour cell PD-L1 expression > 1%, who are at high risk of recurrence after radical surgery and who decline or are unfit for adjuvant chemotherapy [284]. A network meta-analysis suggests superior oncological benefit for adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy over immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients treated with radical surgery for UTUC [285]. 7.2.4.2.4. Radiotherapy Adjuvant radiation therapy has been suggested to control loco-regional disease after surgical removal. The data remains controversial and insufficient for conclusions [286-289]. Moreover, its added value to chemotherapy remains questionable [288]. 7.2.5.
