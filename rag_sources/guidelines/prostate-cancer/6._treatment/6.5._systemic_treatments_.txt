6.5. systemic treatments prostate cancer. 6.5.1. hormonal therapy 6.5.1.1. different types hormonal therapy androgen deprivation achieved suppressing secretion testicular androgens different ways. combined inhibiting action circulating androgens level receptor known complete (or maximal total) androgen blockade (cab) using old-fashioned antiandrogens . 6.5.1.2. castration level castration level testosterone < 50 ng/dl (1.7 nmol/l), defined 40 years ago testosterone testing less sensitive. current methods shown mean value surgical castration 15 ng/dl . therefore, appropriate level defined < 20 ng/dl ( < 0.7 nmol/l). definition important better results repeatedly observed lower testosterone levels compared 50 ng/dl [1036-1038]. however, castrate level considered regulatory authorities clinical trials addressing castration pca still historical < 50 ng/dl (1.7 nmol/l). 6.5.1.3. bilateral orchiectomy bilateral orchiectomy subcapsular pulpectomy still considered primary treatment modality adt. simple, cheap virtually complication-free surgical procedure. easily performed local anaesthesia, quickest way achieve castration level usually reached within less twelve hours. irreversible therefore allow intermittent treatment . 6.5.1.4. oestrogens treatment oestrogens results testosterone suppression associated bone loss . early studies tested oral diethylstilboestrol (des) several doses. due severe side effects, especially thromboembolic complications, even lower doses drugs considered standard first-line treatment . oestrogen patches investigation . 6.5.1.5. luteinising-hormone-releasing hormone agonists long-acting lhrh agonists currently main forms adt. synthetic analogues lhrh delivered depot injections 1-, 2-, 3-, 6-monthly, yearly basis. first injection induces transient rise luteinising hormone (lh) follicle-stimulating hormone (fsh) leading ‘testosterone surge’ ‘flare-up’ phenomenon starts two three days administration lasts one week. may lead detrimental clinical effects (the clinical flare) increased bone pain, acute bladder outlet obstruction, obstructive renal failure, spinal cord compression, cardiovascular death due hypercoagulation status . patients risk usually high-volume symptomatic bony disease. concomitant therapy anti-androgen decreases incidence clinical flare completely remove risk. anti-androgen therapy usually continued four weeks neither timing duration anti-androgen therapy based strong evidence. addition, long-term impact preventing ‘flare up’ unknown . chronic exposure lhrh agonists results down-regulation lhrh-receptors, suppressing lh fsh secretion therefore testosterone production. castration level usually obtained within two four weeks . although formal direct comparison various compounds, considered equally effective . far, survival difference lhrh agonists orchiectomy reported due lack high-quality trials .the different products practical differences need considered everyday practice, including storage temperature, whether drug ready immediate use requires reconstitution, whether drug given subcutaneous intramuscular injection. 6.5.1.6. luteinising-hormone-releasing hormone antagonists luteinising-hormone-releasing hormone antagonists immediately bind lhrh receptors, leading rapid decrease lh, fsh testosterone levels without flare. practical shortcoming compounds lack long-acting depot formulation with, far, monthly formulations available. degarelix lhrh antagonist. standard dosage 240 mg first month followed monthly injections

short-term follow-up data meta-analysis indicate use lhrh antagonist associated significantly lower overall mortality cardiovascular events compared agonists. hand, adverse effects decreased libido,

cardiovascular events significantly lower relugolix (prespecified safety analysis). relugolix approved fda ema hormone sensitive pca. 6.5.1.7. anti-androgens oral compounds classified according chemical structure as: steroidal, e.g., cyproterone acetate (cpa), megestrol acetate medroxyprogesteroneacetate;non-steroidal pure, e.g., nilutamide, flutamide bicalutamide. classes compete androgens receptor level. leads unchanged slightly elevated testosterone level. conversely, steroidal anti-androgens progestational properties leading central inhibition crossing blood-brain barrier. 6.5.1.7.1. steroidal anti-androgens compounds synthetic derivatives hydroxyprogesterone. main pharmacological side effects secondary castration (gynaecomastia quite rare) whilst non-pharmacological side effects cardiovascular toxicity (4–40% cpa) hepatotoxicity. cyproterone acetate first licensed anti-androgen least studied. effective dose monotherapy still unknown. although cpa relatively long half-life (31–41 hours), usually administered two three fractionated doses 100 mg each. one rct cpa showed poorer os compared lhrh analogues . underpowered rct comparing cpa monotherapy flutamide m1b pca show difference dss os median follow-up 8.6 years . cpa monotherapy studies suffer methodological limitations preventing firm conclusions. 6.5.1.7.2. non-steroidal anti-androgens non-steroidal anti-androgen monotherapy e.g. nilutamide, flutamide bicalutamide suppress testosterone secretion claimed libido, overall physical performance bone mineral density (bmd) frequently preserved . non-androgen-related pharmacological side effects differ agents. bicalutamide shows favourable safety tolerability profile flutamide nilutamide . dosage licensed use cab 50 mg/day, 150 mg/day monotherapy. androgen pharmacological side effects mainly gynaecomastia (70%) breast pain (68%). however, non-steroidal anti-androgen monotherapy offers clear bone protection compared lhrh analogues probably lhrh antagonists . three agents share potential liver toxicity (occasionally fatal), requiring regular monitoring patients’ liver enzymes. 6.5.1.7.3. new androgen receptor pathway inhibitors (arpis) adt development castration-resistance (crpc) matter time. considered mediated two main overlapping mechanisms: androgen-receptor (ar)-independent ar-dependent mechanisms (see section 6.5 - castrate-resistant pca). crpc, intracellular androgen level increased compared androgen sensitive cells over-expression ar observed, suggesting adaptive mechanism . led development several new compounds targeting androgen axis. mcrpc, abiraterone acetate enzalutamide approved. addition adt (sustained castration), abiraterone acetate, apalutamide enzalutamide approved treatment metastatic

decreases intracellular testosterone level suppressing synthesis adrenal level inside cancer cells (intracrine mechanism). compound must used together prednisone/prednisolone prevent drug-induced hyperaldosteronism . 6.5.1.7.3.2. apalutamide, darolutamide, enzalutamide (alphabetical order) agents novel non-steroidal anti-androgens higher affinity ar receptor traditional non-steroidal anti-androgens. addition, previous non-steroidal anti-androgens still allow transfer ars nucleus would act partial agonists, three agents also block ar transfer therefore suppress possible agonist-like activity [1065-1067]. darolutamide structurally unique properties particular, preclinical studies, shown cross blood-brain barrier . 6.5.2. cytotoxic drug treatment 6.5.2.1. taxanes paclitaxel derivatives promote assembly microtubules inhibit subsequent depolymeization, impairing tubulin dynamics foster mitotic spindle assembly interphase mitosis . docetaxel binds ss-tubulin dimers 1:1 stoichiometric ratio, exhibiting stronger dynamic instability using inhibitory effect tubulin depolymerization . also activates nf-kb causing apoptosis via mitochondria-dependent pathway . docetaxel shows significant activity prostatetumours. cabazitaxel also works binding microtubules. prevents cellular mitosis stabilises tumour cells. result, cells divide. addition, inhibits androgen receptors binding microtubules microtubule-associated motor protein dynein. consequence, androgen receptor nuclear translocation prevented . common side-effects include peripheral neuropathy, myalgias, neutropenia arthralgia. 6.5.3. non-hormonal non-cytotoxic drug treatments 6.5.3.1. poly (adp-ribose) polymerase inhibitirs (parpi) poly (adp-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (parpi) block
