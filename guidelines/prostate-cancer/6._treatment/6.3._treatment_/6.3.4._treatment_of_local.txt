6.3.4. Treatment of locally-advanced PCa. In the absence of high-level evidence, a SR could not define the most optimal treatment option [794]. Randomised controlled trials are only available for EBRT. A local treatment combined with a systemic treatment provides the best outcome, provided the patient is fit enough to receive both. The initial results of the SCPG-15 trials suggested that randomisation between surgery and EBRT is feasible, but oncologic outcomes are awaited [795]. 6.3.4.1. Radical prostatectomy Surgery for locally-advanced disease as part of a multi-modal therapy has been reported [781,796,797]. However, the comparative oncological effectiveness of RP as part of a multi-modal treatment strategy vs. upfront EBRT with ADT for locally-advanced PCa remains unknown, although a prospective phase III RCT (SPCG-15) comparing RP (with or without adjuvant or salvage EBRT) against primary EBRT and ADT among patients with locally-advanced (T3) disease is currently recruiting [798]. Data from retrospective case series demonstrated over 60% CSS at 15 years and over 75% OS at ten years [781,796,797,799-802]. For cT3b–T4 disease, PCa cohort studies showed 10-year CSS of over 87% and OS of 65% [803,804]. The indication for RP in all previously described stages assumes the absence of clinically detectable nodal involvement (cN0), based on conventional imaging. In case of suspected positive LNs during RP (initially considered cN0) the procedure should not be abandoned since RP may have a survival benefit in these patients. Intra-operative frozen section analysis is not justified in this case [541]. 6.3.4.2. Treatment of cN1 M0 PCa Lymph-node metastasised PCa is an entity where options for local therapy and systemic therapies overlap. Approximately 5% to 10% of newly diagnosed PCa patients have synchronous suspected pelvic nodal metastases on conventional imaging (CT/bone scan) without bone or visceral metastases (cN1 M0 stage). Meta-analyses have shown that PSMA-PET/CT prior to primary treatment in advanced PCa detected disease outside the prostate in 32% of cases despite prior negative conventional imaging using bone scan and pelvic CT/MRI [412]. A RCT assessing PSMA-PET/CT as staging tool in high-risk PCa confirmed these findings and showed a 32% increase in accuracy compared with conventional imaging for the detection of pelvic nodal metastases [429]. Notably, more sensitive imaging also caused a stage shift with more cases classified as miN1, but with, on average, lower nodal disease burden. The management of cN1M0 PCa is historically based on long-term ADT combined with a local treatment. The benefit of adding local treatment has been assessed in various retrospective studies, summarised in one SR [805] including five studies only [806-810]. The results of this SR were confirmed [811]. The findings of this retrospective analysis suggested an advantage in both OS and CSS after local treatment (RT or RP) combined with ADT as compared to ADT alone. Only limited evidence exists supporting RP for cN1 patients. Moschini et al., compared the outcomes of 50 patients with cN+ with those of 252 patients with pN1, but cN0 at pre-operative staging. cN+ was not a significant predictor of CSS [812]. The addition of a brachytherapy boost to ADT plus EBRT was not associated with improved OS in a retrospective study of 1,650 cN1 patients after multivariable adjustment and propensity score matching [813]. The intensification of systemic treatment (abiraterone acetate, docetaxel, zoledronic acid) has been assessed in unplanned sub-group analyses from the STAMPEDE multi-arm RCT by stratifying for cN1 and M1 status [809,814]. The analyses were balanced for nodal involvement and for planned RT use in STAMPEDE at randomisation and at analysis. Abiraterone acetate was associated with a non-significant OS improvement (HR: 0.75, 95% CI: 0.48–1.18) in non-metastatic patients (N0/N+M0), but OS data were still immature with a low number of events. Furthermore, this was an underpowered subgroup analysis and hypothesis generating at best. Moreover, subgroup analyses were performed according to the metastatic/non-metastatic status and to the nodal status (any M) without specific data for the N1M0 population (n = 369; 20% of the overall cohort). The same would apply for the docetaxel arm in the STAMPEDE trial for which no specific subgroup analysis of newly diagnosed N1M0 PCa (n = 171, 14% of the overall cohort) was performed. However, the addition of docetaxel, zoledronic acid, or their combination, did not provide any OS benefit when stratifying by M0 and N+ status. In the AFU-GETUG 12 trial comparing the impact of docetaxel plus estramustine in addition to ADT, 29% of included high-risk non-metastatic PCa patients had a nodal involvement (pN1) at randomisation [815]. A non-significant trend towards better relapse-free survival rates was reported in the treatment arm (HR 0.66; 86 0.43–1.01) without OS benefit. A meta-analysis of docetaxel trials in N0/N1-M0 patients concluded to an 8% 4-year survival advantage for docetaxel compared with ADT alone in terms of failure-free survival without OS benefit [816]. Two RCTs from the STAMPEDE platform protocol reported on men with de novo high-risk/locally-advanced M0 disease, or relapse after primary curative therapy with high-risk features. Thirty-nine percent of patients (n = 774) were N1 on conventional imaging [817]. Radiotherapy in addition to long-term ADT was administered in 71% of these patients. Given the MFS and OS benefits observed in the overall population (see Section 6.3.4.2), combined ADT (for 3 years) and additional abiraterone (for 2 years) should be a SOC in cN1 patients in addition to prostate- and WPRT.

Options other than surgery or radiotherapy for primary treatment 6.3.4.3.1. Investigational therapies Currently cryotherapy, HIFU or focal therapies have no place in the management of locally-advanced PCa. 6.3.4.3.2. Androgen deprivation therapy monotherapy The deferred use of ADT as single treatment modality has been answered by the EORTC 30891 trial [773]. Nine hundred and eighty-five patients with T0–4 N0–2 M0 PCa received ADT alone, either immediately or after symptomatic progression or occurrence of serious complications. After a median follow-up of 12.8 years, the OS favoured immediate treatment (HR: 1.21, 95% CI: 1.05–1.39). Surprisingly, no different disease-free or symptom-free survival was observed, raising the question of survival benefit. In locally-advanced T3–T4 M0 HSPC unsuitable for surgery or RT, immediate ADT may only benefit patients with a PSA > 50 ng/mL and a PSA-DT < twelve months or those that are symptomatic [773,793]. The median time to start deferred treatment was 7 years. In the deferred treatment arm 25.6% of patients died without needing treatment. 6.3.4.4.
