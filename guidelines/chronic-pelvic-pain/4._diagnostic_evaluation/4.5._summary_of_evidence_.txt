4.5. Summary of evidence and recommendations: diagnostic evaluation. 4.5.1. Diagnostic evaluation - general Summary of evidenceLEClinical history and examination are mandatory when making a diagnosis.2a RecommendationStrength ratingTake a full history and evaluate to rule out a treatable cause in all patients with chronic pelvic pain.Strong 4.5.2. Diagnostic evaluation of primary prostate pain syndrome Summary of evidenceLEPrimary prostate pain syndrome is associated with negative cognitive, behavioural, sexual, or emotional consequences, as well as with symptoms suggestive of LUT and sexual dysfunction.2bPrimary prostate pain syndrome has no known single aetiology.3Pain in PPPS involves mechanisms of neuroplasticity and neuropathic pain.2aPrimary prostate pain syndrome has a high impact on QoL.2bDepression and catastrophic thinking are associated with more pain and poorer adjustment.3The prevalence of PPPS-like symptoms is high in population-based studies (> 2%).2bReliable instruments assessing symptom severity as well as phenotypic differences exist.2b RecommendationsStrength ratingAdapt diagnostic procedures to the patient. Exclude specific diseases with similar symptoms.StrongUse a validated symptom and quality of life scoring instrument, such as the National Institutes of Health Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index, for initial assessment and follow-up.StrongAssess primary prostate pain syndrome-associated negative cognitive, behavioural, sexual, or emotional consequences, as well as symptoms of lower urinary tract and sexual dysfunctions.Strong 4.5.3. Diagnostic evaluation of primary bladder pain syndrome Summary of evidenceLEPrimary bladder pain syndrome has no known single aetiology.3Pain in PBPS does not correlate with bladder cystoscopic or histologic findings.2aPrimary bladder pain syndrome Type 3 C can only be confirmed by cystoscopy and histology.2aLesion/non-lesion disease ratios of PBPS are highly variable between studies.2aThe prevalence of PBPS-like symptoms is high in population-based studies.2aPrimary bladder pain syndrome occurs at a level higher than chance with other pain syndromes.2aPrimary bladder pain syndrome has an adverse impact on QoL.2aReliable instruments assessing symptom severity as well as phenotypical differences exist.2a RecommendationsStrength ratingPerform general anaesthetic rigid cystoscopy in patients with bladder pain to subtype and rule out confusable disease.StrongDiagnose patients with symptoms according to the EAU definition, after primary exclusion of specific diseases, with primary bladder pain syndrome (PBPS) by subtype and phenotype.StrongAssess PBPS-associated non-bladder diseases systematically.StrongAssess PBPS-associated negative cognitive, behavioural, sexual, or emotional consequences.StrongUse a validated symptom and quality of life scoring instrument for initial assessment and follow-up.Strong 4.5.4. Diagnostic evaluation of scrotal pain syndrome Summary of evidenceLEThe nerves in the spermatic cord play an important role in scrotal pain.2bUltrasound of the scrotal contents does not aid in diagnosis or treatment of scrotal pain.2bPost-vasectomy pain is seen in a substantial number of men undergoing vasectomy.2bScrotal pain is more often noticed after laparoscopic than after open inguinal hernia repair.1b 4.5.5. Diagnostic evaluation of urethral pain syndrome Summary of evidenceLEPrimary urethral pain syndrome may be a part of BPS.2aUrethral pain involves mechanisms of neuroplasticity and neuropathic pain.2b 4.5.6. Diagnostic evaluation of gynaecological aspects chronic pelvic pain Summary of evidenceLELaparoscopy is well-tolerated and does not appear to have negative psychological effects.1b RecommendationsStrength ratingTake a full uro-gynaecological history in those who have had a continence or prolapsenon-absorbable mesh inserted and consider specialised imaging of the mesh.StrongRefer to a gynaecologist following complete urological evaluation if there is a clinical suspicion of a gynaecological cause for pain. Laparoscopy should be undertaken in accordance with gynaecological guidelines.Strong 4.5.7. Diagnostic evaluation of anorectal pain syndrome Summary of evidenceLETenderness on traction is the main criterion of the chronic anal pain syndrome.1a RecommendationStrength ratingAnorectal function tests are recommended in patients with anorectal pain.Strong 4.5.8. Diagnostic evaluation of nerves to the pelvis Summary of evidenceLEMultiple sensory and functional disorders within the region of the pelvis/urogenital system may occur as a result of injury to one or more of many nerves. The anatomy is complex.2There is no single aetiology for the nerve damage and the symptoms and signs may be few or multiple.1Investigations are often normal.2The peripheral nerve pain syndromes are frequently associated with negative cognitive, behavioural, sexual, or emotional consequences.1 RecommendationsStrength ratingRule out confusable diseases, such as neoplastic disease, infection, trauma and spinal pathology.StrongIf a peripheral nerve pain syndrome is suspected, refer early to an expert in the field, working within a multidisciplinary team environment.WeakImaging and neurophysiology help diagnosis but image and nerve locator guided local anaesthetic injection is preferable.Weak 4.5.9. Diagnostic evaluation of sexological aspects in chronic pelvic pain Summary of evidenceLEChronic pain can lead to decline in sexual activity and satisfaction and may reduce relationship satisfaction.2aMen who reported having sexual, physical or emotional abuse show a higher rate of reporting symptoms of CPPPS.2bSexual dysfunctions are prevalent in men with PPPS.2bIn men with PPPS the most prevalent sexual complaints are ED and ejaculatory dysfunction.3In females with CPPPS all sexual function domains are lower. The most reported dysfunctions are sexual avoidance, dyspareunia and “vaginismus”.2aVulvar pain syndrome is associated with PBPS.2aWomen with PBPS suffer significantly more from fear of pain, dyspareunia and decreased desire.2aPelvic floor muscle function is involved in the excitement and orgasm phases of sexual response.3Chronic pain can cause disturbances in each of the sexual response cycle phases.2b RecommendationStrength ratingScreen patients presenting with symptoms suggestive for chronic primary pelvic pain syndrome for abuse, without suggesting a causal relation with the pain.Weak 4.5.10. Diagnostic evaluation of psychological aspects of chronic pelvic pain Summary of evidenceLEThere is no evidence that distress generates complaints of pelvic pain, or that multiple symptoms suggest unreality of pain.2bCurrent or recent sexual abuse are possible contributory factors in pelvic pain.2a RecommendationsStrength ratingAssess patient psychological factors related to the pain, e.g. pain-related fear, anxiety and depressive symptoms.StrongAsk patients what they think is the cause of their pain and other symptoms to allow the opportunity to inform and reassure.Strong 4.5.11. Diagnostic evaluation of pelvic floor function Summary of evidenceLEThe ICS classification is suitable for clinical practice.2aOver-activity of the pelvic floor muscles is related to chronic pelvic pain, prostate, bladder and vulvar pain.2aOver-activity of the pelvic floor muscles is an input to the CNS causing central sensitisation.2bThere is no accepted standard for diagnosing myofascial trigger points.2aThere is a relation between the location of trigger point and the region where the pain is perceived.3 RecommendationsStrength ratingUse the International Continence Society classification on pelvic floor muscle function and dysfunction.StrongIn patients with Chronic Primary Pelvic Pain Syndrome it is recommended to actively look for the presence of myofascial trigger points.Weak
