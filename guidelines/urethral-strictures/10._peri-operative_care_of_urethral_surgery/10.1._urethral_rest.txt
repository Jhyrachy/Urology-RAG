10.1. Urethral rest. After any form of urethral manipulation (urethral catheter, ISD, dilatation, DVIU), a period of urethral rest is necessary in order to allow tissue recovery and stricture “maturation” before considering urethroplasty. This improves the ability to identify the true extent of the fibrotic segments during subsequent surgery. If the patient develops incapacitating obstructive symptoms or urinary retention, a suprapubic catheter should be inserted. Terlecki et al., propose diagnostic evaluation after two months and urethroplasty after three months of urethral rest. These timings are based on the general principles of wound healing [541]. In their study, it has been shown that these periods allow for reliable stricture evaluation during urethrography which is, in turn, important to ensure selection of the most appropriate urethroplasty technique [541]. Utilising this strategy, similar outcomes were obtained compared to patients with stable previously unmanipulated strictures [541]. However, the optimal duration of urethral rest for all patients is not known and the degree of associated infection and inflammation should be taken into account as well, with longer periods of rest in those with greater degrees of infection and inflammation. Summary of evidenceLEAfter any form of urethral manipulation, a minimum period of three months urethral rest is necessary to allow for tissue healing before performing urethroplasty.3 RecommendationStrength ratingDo not perform urethroplasty within three months of any form of urethral manipulation.Weak
