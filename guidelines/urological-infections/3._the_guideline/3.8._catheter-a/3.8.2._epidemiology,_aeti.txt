3.8.2. Epidemiology, aetiology and pathophysiology. Catheter-associated UTIs are the leading cause of secondary healthcare-associated bacteraemia. Approximately 20% of hospital-acquired bacteraemias arise from the urinary tract, and the mortality associated with this condition is approximately 10% [245]. A multistate point-prevalence survey of 11,282 patients across 183 hospitals reported that UTI accounted for 12.9% of healthcare acquired infections [246]. The incidence of bacteriuria associated with indwelling catheterisation is 3-8% per day [247-251]. The duration of catheterisation is the most important risk factor for the development of a CA-UTI [252,253]. A systematic review and meta-analysis reported an average CA-UTI incidence of 13.79/1000 hospitalised patients with a prevalence of 9.33% [254]. This study also demonstrated that patients at high risk for CA-UTI were female, had a prolonged duration of catheterisation, had diabetes and had longer hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) stays [254]. Urinary catheterisation perturbs host defence mechanisms and provides easier access of uropathogens to the bladder. Indwelling urinary catheters facilitate colonisation with uropathogens by providing a surface for the attachment of host cell binding receptors recognised by bacterial adhesins, thus enhancing microbial adhesion. In addition, the uroepithelial mucosa is damaged, exposing new binding sites for bacterial adhesins, and residual urine in the bladder is increased through pooling below the catheter bulb [255]. Catheter-associated UTIs are often polymicrobial and caused by multiple-drug resistant uropathogens.
