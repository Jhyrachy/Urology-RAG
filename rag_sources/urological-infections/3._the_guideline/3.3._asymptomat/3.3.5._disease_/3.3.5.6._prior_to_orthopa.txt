3.3.5.6. prior orthopaedic surgery. one rct (n=471) one multicentre cohort study (n=303) comparing treatment abu treatment prior orthopaedic surgery (hip arthroplasty/hemiarthroplasty total knee arthroplasty) identified . neither studies showed beneficial effect antibiotic treatment terms prosthetic joint infection (3.8% vs. 0% 3.9% vs. 4.7%, respectively). cohort study reported significant difference rate post-operative symptomatic uti (0.65% vs. 2.7%) . one rct investigated efficacy pre-operative abu treatment fosfomycin-trometamol prevention early-periprosthetic joint infections (pji) hip hemiarthroplasty fractures. asymptomatic bacteriuria predictive early-pji (or: 1.06, 95% ci 0.33 - 3.38), treatment modify early-pji incidence (or: 1.03, 95% ci 0.15 - 7.10) . furthermore, four additional meta-analyses find benefit pre-operative screening treatment abu prior orthopaedic surgery [109-112]. therefore, treatment bacteriuria recommended prior arthroplasty surgery.
