5.13. second resection (second turb). 5.13.1. detection residual disease tumour upstaging significant risk residual tumour initial turb tat1 lesions demonstrated . residual cancer potential worsen oncological outcomes therefore emphasises importance effective initial turb. patients initial incomplete turb (either extensive tumour intra-operative complications) require second completion resection, documentation resection completeness time initial turb essential. main purposes second turb to: (1) clear residual cancer; (2) re-resect previous resection site establish correct pathological staging; (3) obtain missing elements clinical information (e.g. extent cancer, involvement prostatic urethra). systematic review analysing data 8,409 patients ta t1 hg uc demonstrated 51% risk persistence 8% risk under-staging t1 tumours. analysis also showed high risk residual disease ta tumours, observation based limited number cases. residual lesions detected original tumour location . another systematic review meta-analysis 3,556 patients t1 tumours showed prevalence rate residual tumours upstaging invasive disease turb remained high even subgroup detrusor muscle sampled initial turb. subgroup 1,565 t1 tumours detrusor muscle present, persistent tumour found 58% under-staging occurred 11% cases . prospective trials suggest post-operative positive urine cytology xpert bladder® (urine mrna test) independently associated residual disease second resection risk future recurrences, respectively. data, however, need confirmed studies. 5.13.2. impact second resection treatment outcomes second turb increase recurrence-free survival (rfs) [207-209], improve outcomes bcg treatment provide prognostic information [211-214]. retrospective evaluation large multi-institutional cohort 2,451 patients bcg-treated t1 g3/hg tumours (a second resection performed 935 patients), second resection improved rfs, progression-free survival (pfs) overall survival (os) patients without detrusor muscle initial resection specimen . retrospective analysis 7,666 patients diagnosed t1 cancer ontario, 2,162 underwent second resection; adjusting effects confounding variables, os (and css) better patients underwent second resection . apparent improved survival could also result selection bias fitter patients undergoing second resections. whilst single centre retrospective review revealed survival benefit 209 hgta patients underwent second turb , evidence required identify specific sub-groups patients high-grade cancer likely benefit second resection. 5.13.3. timing second resection retrospective evaluation showed second resection performed 14–42 days initial resection provides longer rfs pfs compared second resection performed 43–90 days . based currently available evidence, second turb recommended selected cases 2 6 weeks initial resection (for recommendations patient selection, see section 5.14). 5.13.4. recording results results second resection (residual tumours under-staging) reflect quality effectiveness initial turb. goal improve quality initial turb, results second resection recorded.
