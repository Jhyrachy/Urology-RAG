5.3. Muscle-invasive and metastatic bladder cancer and health status. Complications from RC may be directly related to pre-existing comorbidity as well as the surgical procedure, bowel anastomosis, or urinary diversion. A significant body of literature has evaluated the usefulness of age as a prognostic factor for RC, although chronological age is less important than frailty [159-161]. Frailty is a syndrome of reduced ability to respond to stressors. Patients with frailty have a higher risk of mortality and negative side effects of cancer treatment [162]. Controversy remains regarding age, RC and the type of urinary diversion. Radical cystectomy is associated with the greatest risk reduction in disease-related and non-disease-related death in patients aged < 80 years [163]. The largest retrospective study on RC in septuagenarians and octogenarians based on data from the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database (n = 1,710) showed no significant difference for wound, cardiac, or pulmonary complications. However, the risk of mortality in octogenarians compared to septuagenarians is higher (4.3% vs. 2.3%) [164]. Although some octogenarians successfully underwent a neobladder procedure, most patients were treated with an ileal conduit diversion. It is important to evaluate functioning and quality of life (QoL) of older patients using a standardised geriatric assessment, as well as carrying out a standard medical evaluation [165]. Sarcopenia has been shown to be an independent predictor for OS and CSS in a large multi-centre study with patients undergoing RC for BC [166]. In order to predict CSM after RC in patients receiving NAC, sarcopenia should be assessed after completing chemotherapy [167]. Other risk factors for morbidity include prior abdominal surgery, extravesical disease, and prior RT [168]. Female gender, an increased BMI and lower pre-operative albumin levels are associated with a higher rate of parastomal hernias [169]. Low pre-operative serum albumin is also associated with impaired wound healing, gastrointestinal (GI) complications and a decrease of recurrence-free and OS after RC [170,171]. Therefore, it could be used as a prognostic biomarker for patients undergoing RC. Metformin has been suggested as having possibly anticancer activity in bladder cancer by inhibiting tumour growth as well as being synergistic with Cisplatin. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 4,006 patients suggests that Metformin use was associated with lower cancer specific and overall moratlity in patients with MIBC [172]. 5.3.1. Evaluation of comorbidity, frailty and cognition Rochon et al., have shown that evaluation of comorbidity provides a better indicator of life expectancy in MIBC than patient age [173]. Evaluation of comorbidity helps to identify factors likely to interfere with, or have an impact on, treatment and the evolution and prognosis of MIBC [174]. The value of assessing overall health before recommending and proceeding with surgery was emphasised by Zietman et al., who have demonstrated an association between comorbidity and adverse pathological and survival outcomes following RC [175]. Similar results were found for the impact of comorbidity on cancer-specific and other-cause mortality in a population-based competing risk analysis of > 11,260 patients from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registries. Age carried the highest risk for other-cause mortality but not for increased cancer-specific death, while the stage of locally-advanced tumour was the strongest predictor for decreased CSS [176]. Stratifying older patients according to frailty using a multidisciplinary approach will help select patients most likely to benefit from radical surgery and to optimise treatment outcomes [177]. There are many different screening tools available for frailty and local approaches can be used. Examples include the G8 and the Clinical Frailty Scale (See Table 5.2 and Figure 5.1 below). Cognitive impairment can be screened for by using a tool such as the mini-COG (https://mini-cog. com/), which consists of three-word recall and a clock-drawing test, and can be completed within 5 minutes. A score of ≤ 3/5 indicates the need to refer the patient for full cognitive assessment. Patients with any form of cognitive impairment (e.g., Alzheimer’s or vascular dementia) may need a capacity assessment of their ability to make an informed decision, which is an important factor in health status assessment. Cognitive impairment also predicts risk of delirium, which is important for patients undergoing surgery [178].

Comorbidity scales, anaesthetic risk classification and geriatric assessment A range of comorbidity scales has been developed [181], seven of which have been validated [182-188]. The Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) ranges from 0 to 30 according to the importance of comorbidity described at four levels and is calculated by healthcare practitioners based on patients’ medical records. The score has been widely studied in patients with BC and found to be an independent prognostic factor for peri-operative mortality [189,190], overall mortality [191], and CSM [163,92-194]. Only the age-adjusted version of the CCI was correlated with both cancer-specific and other-cause mortality [195]. The age-adjusted CCI (Table 5.3) is the most widely used comorbidity index in cancer for estimating long-term survival and is easily calculated [196]. Health assessment of oncology patients must be supplemented by measuring their activity level. Extermann et al., have shown that there is no correlation between morbidity and competitive activity level [197]. The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) scores and Karnofsky index have been validated to measure patient activity [198]. Performance score is correlated with patient OS after RC [193] and palliative chemotherapy [199-201]. Patients who have screened positive for frailty or cognitive impairment benefit from an assessment by a geriatrician. This allows identification of geriatric syndromes and any scope for optimisation. The most complete protocol is the Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) [202] which is useful in the care of cancer patients [203]. In BC, the CGA has been used to adapt gemcitabine chemotherapy in previously untreated older patients with advanced BC [204].
