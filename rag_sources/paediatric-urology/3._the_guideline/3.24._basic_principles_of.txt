3.24. basic principles laparoscopic surgery children. 3.24.1. epidemiology, aetiology pathophysiology use laparoscopy robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery rapidly increasing gained widespread acceptance many urological surgeries children . laparoscopy commonly performed non-palpable testis, nephrectomy, heminephrectomy, varicocelectomy, pyeloplasty, ureteral reimplantation. expanding scope related technological advancements allows surgeons perform complex procedures minimally invasive fashion even infants younger children. generally, well established benefits minimally invasive surgery decreased pain, shorter convalescence better cosmetics compared traditional open surgery . comparing transperitoneal retroperitoneal approach, difference recovery bowel function . additional advantages robotic surgery conventional laparoscopy include ergonomics, 3d vision, better manoeuvrability, decreased tremor easy learning curve. limitations considered increased operative time, smaller working space young age, cost experience surgeon anaesthesiologist. success complication rates comparable nephrectomy pyeloplasty advantages laparoscopy robotic surgery ureteral reimplantation proven recommended experienced centres. worldwide experience increases, accumulating awareness physiological consequences related intra- retroperitoneal co2 insufflation children. contrast traditional open surgery pneumoperitoneum may physiological responses require close monitoring surgery taken seriously. 3.24.2. technical considerations physiological consequences 3.24.2.1. pre-operative evaluation laparoscopy children requires specific anaesthetic precautions. physiological effects co2 pneumoperitoneum, positioning patient potentially increased operative time need considered anaesthesiology team. therefore, detailed medical examination risk assessment mandatory pre-operatively. especially cardiac pulmonary system assessed since increased intra-abdominal pressure may lead decreased ventricular preload . 3.24.2.2. abdominal insufflation abdominal insufflation main principle laparoscopic surgery create working space surgeon. carbon dioxide commonly used insufflation laparoscopic centres throughout world. alternatives reported nitrous oxide, helium, argon air. however, co2 considered best available gas colourless, cheap, high solubility vascular system excreted pulmonary system making safest option. smaller children infants absorb co2 older children , suggesting need attention early laparoscopic surgery children. complications laparoscopy attributable gaining access abdominal cavity. one study reporting complications > 5,400 paediatric laparoscopic surgeries showed overall complication rate 5.3% 4.2% related problematic insufflation (subcutaneous emphysema, gas embolism, injury organs vascular structures, mis-insufflation etc.) . two main well-established techniques initial access abdomen retroperitoneum: open technique (hasson) veress needle. studies comparing two different access techniques paediatric laparoscopic urological procedures showed similar complication rates . vast majority complications minor related lack surgical experience. particularly infants smaller children, open access technique recommended panel reduce chance complications. elasticity abdominal wall age-related higher infants small children compared older children . pneumoperitoneal pressure (pnp mmhg) one critical points needs carefully considered laparoscopic surgeons. rct compared two different pneumoperitoneal pressure groups (6-8 mmhg vs. 9-10 mmhg) infants less 10 kg . demonstrated higher pressures associated pronounced respiratory haemodynamic changes well increased post-operative pain scores prolonged time resume feeding. 3.24.2.3. pulmonary effects intra-abdominal insufflation diaphragm pushed upwards due increased abdominal pressure. leads decreased total pulmonary compliance. combined co2 absorption may lead hypercarbia acidosis, particularly case prolonged operative time low pulmonary reserve infants. trendelenburg position may also aggravate situation operations pelvic region, anti-reflux bladder neck surgeries. several studies revealed increased end tidal co2 (et co2) related co2 absorption . one study showed 33% increase et co2 majority neonatal laparoscopic thoracoscopic procedures . shorter operative time lower intra-abdominal pressures decrease risk increased et co2. hypoxemia rarely seen, even neonates easily adjusted increasing minute ventilation. findings highlight importance close monitoring children. 3.24.2.4. cardiovascular effects intra-abdominal pressure, co2 absorption positioning may also affect cardiovascular system. shown adults initiation pneumoperitoneum, cardiac output stroke volume decrease mean arterial pressure, central venous pressure systemic vascular resistance increase . similar outcomes reported paediatric laparoscopy nuances. cardiac output 30% decreased blood pressure remained stable laparoscopic orchidopexy pnp 10 mmhg children aged 6-30 months . pnp lowered 12 mmhg 6 mmhg, cardiac index vascular parameters normalised . using high intra-abdominal pressures infants congenital cardiac abnormalities may result re-opening cardiac shunts foramen ovale ductus arteriosus . although cardiovascular effects using high pnp clinically measurable, may significant clinical impact healthy children. however, clear using lower pressures safer especially smaller children. 3.24.2.5. effects renal function study measuring renal oxygenation nirs (near-infrared spectroscopy) laparoscopy showed pneumoperitoneum might negative effect renal oxygenation . however, effect reversible desufflation. studies showed pneumoperitoneum may also adverse effects renal blood flow . high intra-abdominal pressures reverse trendelenburg position may cause decreased glomerular filtration rate decreased urine output. one study shown 88% infants 14% children one year old develop anuria within 45 minutes initiation pnp 8 mmhg . however, urine output recovers temporary polyuria operation. although clinical relevance decreased urine output seems insignificant, important monitor fluid electrolyte balance children laparoscopic surgery. 3.24.2.6. effects neurological system another effect pneumoperitoneum increased intracranial pressure (icp) normalises desufflation abdomen . trendelenburg position, high pnp hypoventilation additional risk factors increased icp. laparoscopy therefore contraindicated patients intracranial space occupying lesions . children ventriculo-peritoneal shunts require precautions regards shunt drainage, however laparoscopy contraindicated . 3.24.2.7. comparison robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery versus laparoscopic surgery physiological differences expected two approaches since pneumoperitoneum needs achieved manner. however, systematic review comparing robot-assisted laparoscopic pyeloplasty conventional laparoscopy infants children showed differences terms operative success redo rates two techniques . operative time, hospital length stay complication rates, robotic approach appears slightly superior children . however, infant population, operative time longer robot-assisted approach compared conventional laparoscopy higher complication rate, mainly due higher rate port-site hernias . robot-assisted approach might aid filling gap minimally invasive surgery paediatric urologists shorter learning curve necessarily require prior laparoscopic experience. downsides robotic approach size instruments, accessibility costs . 3.24.3. summary evidence recommendations laparoscopy children summary evidencelelaparoscopy robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery safely performed children1the general benefits
