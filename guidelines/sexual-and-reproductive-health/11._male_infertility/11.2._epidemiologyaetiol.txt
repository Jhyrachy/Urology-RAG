11.2. Epidemiology/aetiology/pathophysiology/risk factors. 11.2.1. Introduction About 15% of couples do not achieve pregnancy within one year and seek medical treatment for infertility [1524]. One in eight couples encounter problems when attempting to conceive a first child and one in six when attempting to conceive a subsequent child [1525]. In 50% of involuntarily childless couples, a male-infertility-associated factor is found, usually together with abnormal semen parameters [1522]. For this reason, in all infertile couples the male should undergo medical evaluation by a urologist trained in male reproduction. Male fertility can be impaired as a result of many different conditions (Table 39), thus including [1522]: congenital or acquired urogenital abnormalities;genetic abnormalities;varicocele;urogenital tract infections;increased scrotal temperature (e.g., as a consequence of varicocele);endocrine disturbances;immunological factors;iatrogenic factors (e.g., previous scrotal surgery);malignancy;gonadotoxic exposure (e.g., radiotherapy or chemotherapy); Advanced paternal age has emerged as one of the main risk factors associated with the progressive increase in the prevalence of male factor infertility [1526-1533]. Advanced maternal age must be considered in the management of every infertile couple, and in the subsequent decisions throughout the diagnostic and therapeutic strategy of the male partner [1534,1535]. This should include the age and ovarian reserve of the female partner, since these parameters might determine decision-making in terms of timing and therapeutic strategies (e.g., assisted reproductive technology [ART] vs. surgical intervention) [1526-1529]. Earlier evaluation is still a matter of debate in couples in with female partners older than 35 years who have not conceived for 6 months as ovarian reserve may fall [1536-1538]. Table 39 summarises the main male-infertility-associated factors.

Summary of evidence and recommendations on epidemiology and aetiology of male infertility Summary of evidenceLEInfertility affects 15% of couples of reproductive age.3A male factor infertility can be identified in about 50% of infertile couples.2aA pure male factor infertility can be identified in about 20% of infertile couples.2aSeveral risk factors such as genetic factors, urogenital abnormalities, endocrine disorders, malignant diseases and gonadotoxic treatments can cause male infertility.2a RecommendationsStrength ratingPerform infertility evaluation in couples who have not conceived after twelve months of regular, unprotected intercourse.StrongInvestigate both partners simultaneously to categorise the cause of infertility.StrongInvestigate all men belonging to couples seeking medical help for fertility problems.Strong
