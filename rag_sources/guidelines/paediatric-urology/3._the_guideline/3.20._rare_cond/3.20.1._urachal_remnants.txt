3.20.1. urachal remnants. 3.20.1.1. introduction urachus embryonic structure arising result separation allantois ventral cloaca. allantois appears day sixteen tiny, fingerlike outpouching caudal wall yolk sac, contiguous ventral cloaca one end umbilicus other. ventral portion cloaca develops bladder cloacal division urogenital septum. thus, bladder initially extends way umbilicus . progressive foetal development, bladder descends pelvis, attachment umbilicus urachus becomes looser apical portion progressively narrows small, epithelialised, fibromuscular strand fourth fifth month gestation. urachus obliterates completely birth, forming median umbilical ligament [1387-1389]. urachus varies 3 10 cm length 8 10 mm diameter. three-layered tubular structure, innermost layer lined transitional epithelium, middle layer composed connective tissue, outermost muscular layer continuity detrusor muscle . urachal remnants (urs) originate failure obliteration allantois, resulting urachal anomaly (1) urachal sinus, (2) urachal cyst, (3) vesico-urachal diverticulum, (4) patent urachus . often urachal anomaly asymptomatic, occasionally may become infected, may cause urinary symptoms, develop urachal carcinoma later life . 3.20.1.2. epidemiology reports occurrence rates literature vary broadly rare disease older literature fairly common problem. robert et al. found urs present 61.7% patients younger 16 years . also noted frequency urs decreased increasing age. supports physiological regression urs age. stopak et al. attributed upsurge increased awareness among community paediatricians improvements us made visualisation urachal remnants easier . clinical studies paediatric autopsy studies past shown much lower incidence. rubin found incidence 1 7,610 cases patent urachus 1 5,000 cases urachal cysts . nix et al. noted three anomalies 1,168,760 hospital admissions, blichert-toft et al. reported five ur cases 40,000 patients . incidence rate males little higher females . range various urs reported literature 10% 48% patent urachus, 31% 43% urachal cyst, 18% 43% urachal sinus 3% 4% urachal diverticulum . 3.20.1.3. symptoms patent urachus causes continuous intermittent urine leakage umbilicus causing umbilical granulation erythema infants . urachal cyst usually diagnosed (1) incidentally, (2) becomes infected causing abdominal pain discharge pus umbilicus recurrent utis drains bladder. common symptom umbilical granulation, discharge erythema infants abdominal pain older children . symptoms infected urachal anomalies vary high fever, abdominal pain, urinary tract infections, luts and/or abdominal mass [1401-1405]. urachal diverticulum often asymptomatic usually found incidentally investigations problems. alternating sinus empty either bladder umbilicus characteristic responsible various presentations . infection reported common complication urachal anomalies . severe infection may develop peritonitis sepsis. cultures umbilical discharge usually show staphylococcus, streptococcus e. coli . congenital anomalies: ashley found simultaneous anomaly 17 46 children, vur common anomaly (6 patients) . investigators reported associated anomalies cases persistent urs including meatal stenosis, hypospadias, umbilical inguinal hernias, cryptorchidism, anal atresia, omphalocele, ureteropelvic obstruction frequently, vur [1399,1410-1412]. 3.20.1.4. diagnosis majority cases complaints ur, careful history physical examination confirm suspicion ur. many patients confirmed us studies . mri ct scan may necessary minority children . association congenital abnormalities, studies vcug cystoscopy may undertaken well. general, vcug undertaken child also presents uti us shows signs upper tract abnormalities. diagnosis per se necessary ;
