5.6.4. Pharmacological management. 5.6.4.1. Drugs for urgency urinary incontinence Muscarinic receptor antagonists [654-657] and beta-3 agonist [308-310,658-661] are currently the first-line pharmacological treatments for UUI. The mechanism of action, efficacy, and safety and tolerability profiles of both classes of drugs are discussed in detail in sections 5.2.3 and 5.2.4, respectively. 5.6.4.2. Drugs for stress urinary incontinence A SR of eight studies evaluating the efficacy of duloxetine in postprostatectomy SUI reported that duloxetine resulted in a mean dry rate of 58% (25–89%), mean improvement in pad number of 61% (12–100%), and mean improvement in one-hour pad weight of 68% (53–90%), at short-term follow-up (mean one to nine months) [662]. However, mean adverse event rates were high, and treatment was discontinued in 38% of cases. The most common adverse events included: fatigue, somnolence and nausea and were reported in 18% of patients [662]. The overall certainty of the evidence was low due to study heterogeneity and methodological limitations. Further RCTs with long-term follow-up are required. Duloxetine is currently prescribed in an off-label setting. Summary of evidenceLEAntimuscarinic monotherapy can significantly improve urgency, UUI, and increased daytime frequency.1bMirabegron is superior to placebo and as efficacious as antimuscarinics for improvement of UUI.1bDuloxetine led to a short-term improvement in post-prostatectomy SUI symptoms and QoL improvement; however, a significant proportion of men discontinued treatment.1b RecommendationsStrength ratingOffer antimuscarinic drugs or mirabegron to adults with urgency urinary incontinence who failed conservative treatment.StrongOffer duloxetine to men with stress urinary incontinence.WeakInform patients about the possible adverse events of duloxetine and that its use is off label for this indication in Europe.Strong
