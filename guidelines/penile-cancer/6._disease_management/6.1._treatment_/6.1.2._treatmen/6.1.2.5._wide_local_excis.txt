6.1.2.5. Wide local excision and circumcision. In addition to treating preputial penile cancer, circumcision combined with topical treatment, laser therapy or brachytherapy, facilitates follow-up examinations [153]. For small, distal preputial penile cancer, circumcision alone usually presents adequate treatment. However, lesions located on the corona or glans, limited in size, may be treated with wide local excision which should include a margin of clinically normal-appearing skin around the tumour and surrounding erythema (see Section 6.1.2.1). Few data on wide local excision are available, the technique has, so far, only been described in retrospective series combining various types of organ-sparing treatments.
