3.4.1. Indications and contraindications for treatment of hypogonadism. Patients with symptomatic hypogonadism (total testosterone < 12 nmol/L) without specific contraindications are suitable candidates to receive testosterone therapy (Table 4). Absolute contraindications are untreated breast and prostate cancer (PCa). Similarly, conditions such as cardiovascular events as well as uncontrolled or poorly controlled congestive heart failure should be considered when prescribing testosterone therapy [77]. Conversely, severe lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) [International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) score > 19] represent a relative contraindication, as there is insufficient data on the long-term effects of testosterone therapy in these patients [66]. A positive family history for venous thromboembolism requires further analysis to exclude a condition of undiagnosed thrombophilia-hypofibrinolysis [78]. These patients need to be carefully counselled prior to testosterone therapy initiation. A haematocrit (HCT) > 54% should require testosterone therapy withdrawal, reduction in dose, change of formulation and venesection depending on the clinical situation to avoid any potential cardio-vascular complications. Lower baseline HTC (48-50%) should be carefully evaluated before testosterone therapy initiation, to avoid pathological increases during treatment, especially in high-risk men such as those with COPD or Obstructive Sleep Apnoea Syndrome (OSAS). Accordingly, the Framingham Heart Study showed that HCT > 48% represented a condition associated with increased risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) and mortality and was associated with cardiovascular disorders [79]. Testosterone therapy suppresses gonadotropin and endogenous testosterone secretion as well as spermatogenesis [80]; therefore, testosterone therapy is contraindicated in individuals who desire fertility [81]. Secondary hypogonadism is characterised by low or inappropriately normal gonadotropin levels; therefore, the rationale is to substitute the gonadotropin deficiency with simultaneously FSH and LH analogues, if fertility is desired [82].
