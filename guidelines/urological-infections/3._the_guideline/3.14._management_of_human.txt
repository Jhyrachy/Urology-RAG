3.14. Management of Human papillomavirus in men. 3.14.1. Epidemiology Human papilloma virus (HPV) is one of the most frequently sexually transmitted viruses encompassing both oncogenic (low- and high-risk variants) and non-oncogenic viruses. HPV 16 is the most common oncogenic variant, detected in 20% of all HPV cases [424]. A recent meta-analysis revealed a prevalence of 49% of any type of HPV and 35% of high-risk HPV in men [425]. Similar to the female genital tract, half of all HPV infections in the male genital tract are co-infections (≥ 2 HPV strains) [426]. HPV presence is dependent on study setting. In men attending urological clinics HPV was detected in 6% of urine samples [427]. A meta-analysis reported seminal HPV in 4.5-15.2% of patients resulting in seminal HPV being associated with decreased male fertility [424]. A cross sectional study of 430 men presenting for fertility treatment detected HPV in 14.9% of semen samples [428]. The presence of HPV in semen was not associated with impaired semen quality [428]. However, another systematic review reported a possible association between HPV and altered semen parameters, and in women possible miscarriage or premature rupture of the membrane during pregnancy [429]. HPV6 and/or 11 were the most common genotypes detected in an observational study of anogenital warts, whilst HPV16 is correlated with severity of anal cytology [430]. The incidence of non-oncogenic HPV infection has been shown to be higher in men than women [431]. In males, approximately 33% of penile cancers and up to 90% of anal cancers are attributed to high-risk HPV infections, primarily with HPV16 [432]. The EAU Penial Cancer Guidelines will publish a comprehensive update in March 2022 including the results of two systematic reviews on HPV and penile cancer. Oral HPV is associated with oropharyngeal carcinomas approximately 22.4%, 4.4% and 3.5% of oral cavity, oropharynx and larynx cancers, respectively are attributed to HPV [432]. Systematic reviews have reported prevalence rates of oral HPV from 5.5-7.7%, with HPV16 present in 1-1.4% of patients [433,434]. 3.14.2. Risk factors Risk factors for HPV infection include early age of first sexual intercourse, sexual promiscuity, higher frequency of sexual intercourse, smoking and poor immune function [435-439]. Incidence and prevalence of overall HPV was considerably higher in MSM compared to heterosexuals [433,436]. Overall, the prevalence of HPV in different sites seems to be higher in young, sexual-active adults compared to other population groups [435]. Stable sexual habits, circumcision and condom use are protective factors against HPV [425,439-443]. Added risk factors of oral HPV infection are alcohol consumption, poor oral hygiene and sexual behaviours (oral and vaginal) [433,435]. Positive HIV status, phimosis, and HPV status of the partner have also been associated with anogenital HPV status and decreased clearance in a number of studies [440]. 3.14.3. Transmission HPV typically spreads by sustained direct skin-to-skin or mucosal contact, with vaginal, oral and anal sex being the most common transmission route [437]. In addition, HPV has been found on surfaces in medical settings and public environments raising the possibility of object-to-skin/mucosa transmission [444]. Further studies on non-sexual and non-penetrative sexual transmission are needed to understand the complexity of HPV transmission. HPV transmission may also be influenced by genotype, with a higher incidence of HPV51 and HPV52 and a high prevalence of HPV16 and HPV18 in the general and high-risk male population [437]. 3.14.4. Clearance HPV time-to-clearance ranges from 1.3 to 42.1 months [445]. Clearance may be influenced by HPV genotype, patients’ characteristics and affected body site [436,440,445]. HPV 16 has the highest incidence of high-risk HPV variants and has the lowest clearance across sites [440]. 3.14.5. Diagnosis There is currently no approved test for HPV in men. Routine testing to check for HPV or HPV-related disease in men is not recommended. A physical examination to identify HPV lesions should be carried out. An acetic acid test to diagnose sub-clinical HPV lesions may be performed. If the diagnosis is uncertain or there is a suspicion of cancer a biopsy should be carried out. Intra-urethral condylomas are relatively uncommon and are usually limited to the distal urethral meatus [446,447]. Urethrocystoscopy may be used to diagnose the presence of intra-urethral or bladder warts [447]; however, there is no high-level evidence for the use of invasive diagnostic tools for localisation of intra-urethral HPV. For detailed recommendations on the diagnosis of anogenital warts please refer to the IUSTI‐European guideline for the management of anogenital warts [448]. 3.14.6. Treatment of HPV related diseases Approximately 90% of HPV infections do not cause any problems and are cleared by the body within 2 years. However, treatment is required when HPV infection manifests as anogenital warts to prevent the transmission of HPV-associated anogenital infection and to minimise the discomfort caused to patients [448]. Of the treatment options available only surgical treatment has a primary clearance rate approaching 100%. 3.14.6.1. Treatments suitable for self-application Patient-applied treatments include podophyllotoxin, salicylic acid, imiquimod, polyphenon E, 5-fluoracil and potassium hydroxide [448]. Imiquimod 5% cream showed a total clearance of external genital or perianal warts in 50% of immunocompetent patients [449] as well as in HIV positive patients successfully treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy [450]. A Cochrane review of published RCTs found imiquimod to be superior to placebo in achieving complete clearance of warts (RR: 4.03, 95% CI: 2.03–7.99) [451]. The recommended treatment schedule is imiquimod 5% cream applied to all external warts overnight 3 times each week for 16 weeks [448]. In an RCT involving 502 patients with genital and/or perianal warts sinecatechins 15% and 10% showed a complete clearance of all baseline and newly occurring warts in 57.2% and 56.3% of patients, respectively vs. 33.7% for placebo [452]. In addition, sinecatechins 10% has been shown to be associated with lower short-term recurrence rates when used as sequential therapy after laser CO2 ablative therapy [453]. Sinecatechins is applied three times daily until complete clearance, or for up to 16 weeks. Clearance rates of 36–83% for podophyllotoxin solution and 43–70% for podophyllotoxin cream have been reported [448]. A systematic review and meta‐analysis confirmed the effectiveness of podophyllotoxin 0.5% solution relative to placebo (RR: 19.86, 95% CI: 3.88–101.65) [454]. Podophyllotoxin is self‐applied to lesions twice daily for 3 days, followed by four rest days, for up to 4 or 5 weeks. An RCT has also shown potassium hydroxide 5% to be an effective, safe, and low-cost treatment modality for genital warts in men [455]. 3.14.6.2. Physician-administered treatment 3.14.6.2 Physician-administered treatment Physician-administered treatments included cryotherapy (79-88% clearance rate; 25-39% recurrence rate), surgical treatment (61-94% clearance rate), including excision, electrosurgery, electrocautery and laser therapy (75% clearance rate) [456,457]. Physician-administered therapies are associated with close to 100% clearance rates, but they are also associated with high rates of recurrence as they often fail to eliminate invisible HPV-infected lesions [456,457]. No data about the superiority of one treatment over another are available. However, among all interventions evaluated in a recent systematic review and network meta-analysis, surgical excision appeared to be the most effective treatment at minimising risk of recurrence [458]. 3.14.6.3.

Circumcision for reduction of HPV prevalence Male circumcision is a simple surgical procedure which has been shown to reduce the incidence of sexually transmitted infections including HIV, syphilis and HSV-2 [459]. Two systematic reviews and meta-analyses, showed an inverse association between male circumcision and genital HPV prevalence in men [443,445]. It has been suggested that male circumcision could be considered as an additional one-time preventative intervention likely to reduce the burden of HPV-related diseases in both men and women, particularly among those countries in which HPV vaccination programs and cervical screening are not available [445]. Summary of evidenceLETwo systematic reviews and meta-analyses, showed an inverse association between male circumcision and genital HPV prevalence in men1a RecommendationStrength ratingDiscuss male circumcision with patients as an additional one-time preventative intervention for HPV-related diseases.Strong 3.14.8. Therapeutic vaccination Three different vaccines against HPV have been licensed to date, but routine vaccination of males is currently implemented in only a few countries including Australia, Canada, the USA and Austria16. The aim of male vaccination is to reduce the rate of anal and penile cancers as well as head and neck cancers [432,460]. A systematic review including a total of 5,294 patients reported vaccine efficacy against persisting (at least six months) anogenital HPV16 infections of 46.9% (28.6-60.8%) and against persisting oral infections of 88% (2–98%). A vaccine efficacy of 61.9% (21.4–82.8%) and 46.8% (20-77.9%) was observed against anal intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 and 3 lesions, respectively [432]. The systematic review reported no meaningful estimates on vaccine efficacy against penile intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or 3, and no data were identified for anal, penile or head and neck squamous cell cancers [432]. A phase III clinical trial including 180 male patients evaluated the potential of MVA E2 recombinant vaccinia virus to treat intraepithelial lesions associated with papillomavirus infection [461]. the study showed promising results in terms of immune system stimulation against HPV lesions as well as regression in intraepithelial lesions. Summary of evidenceLEThe role of therapeutic HPV vaccination in males in terms of effectiveness and safety is limited by the small number of relevant studies.2Therapeutic HPV vaccination in males is moderately effective against persistent anogenital HPV16 infection [(46.9% (28.6-60.8%)] and high-grade anal intraepithelial lesions [grade 2: 61.9% (21.4–82.8%); grade 3: 46.8% (20-77.9%)].1b RecommendationStrength ratingOffer HPV vaccine to males after surgical removal of high-grade anal intraepithelial neoplasia.Weak 3.14.9. Prophylactic vaccination A systematic review and meta-analysis reported that vaccination is moderately effective against genital HPV-related diseases irrespective of an individual’s HPV status; however, higher vaccine efficacy was observed in HPV-naïve males [432]. Supporting the early vaccination of boys with the goal of establishing optimal vaccine-induced protection before the onset of sexual activity [432]. An RCT including 1,124 demonstrated high efficacy of the quadrivalent HPV vaccine vs. placebo against HPV6/11/16/18-related persistent infections [462]. Furthermore, the vaccine elicited a robust immune response and was well tolerated with mild vaccination-related adverse events e.g. injection-site pain and swelling [462]. In addition, a Cochrane review, demonstrated that the quadrivalent HPV vaccine appears to be effective in the prevention of external genital lesions and genital warts in males [463]. Despite the fact quadrivalent HPV vaccines were approved for use in young adult males in 2010 vaccination rates have remained low at 10-15% [464]. Barriers to uptake in this patient group include lack of awareness about HPV vaccines and HPV-related diseases, concerns about vaccine safety and efficacy, economic/cost issues related to vaccine uptake, underestimation of HPV infection risks and sexual activity [464]. Health care professionals should provide easily understood and accessible communication resources regarding these issues, in order to educate young adult males and their families on the importance of HPV vaccination to reduce the incidence of certain cancers in the later life [464,465]. Summary of evidenceLEHPV vaccine is effective in the prevention of external genital lesions and genital warts in males.1aHPV vaccination is moderately effective against genital HPV-related diseases irrespective of a individual’s HPV status; however, higher vaccine efficacy was observed in HPV-naïve males.1aA systematic review of HPV vaccination barriers among adolescent and young adult males identified a number of barriers to vaccine uptake including fear of side-effects, limited HPV awareness, financial costs and changes in sexual activity.1bAn intervention study to evaluate whether electronic messaging can increase human papillomavirus vaccine completion and knowledge among college students concluded that intervention increased knowledge but not vaccine completion.2b RecommendationsStrength ratingOffer early HPV vaccination to boys with the goal of establishing optimal vaccine-induced protection before the onset of sexual activity.StrongApply diverse communication strategies in order to improve HPV vaccination knowledge in young adult males.Strong Figure 3: Diagnostic and treatment algorithm for the management of HPV in men
