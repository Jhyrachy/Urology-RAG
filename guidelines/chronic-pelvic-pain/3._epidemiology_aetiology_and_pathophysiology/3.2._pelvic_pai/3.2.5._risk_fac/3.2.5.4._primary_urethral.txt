3.2.5.4. Primary urethral pain syndrome. Several mechanisms for the development of primary urethral pain syndrome have been proposed. The intimate relationship of the urethra with the bladder (both covered with urothelium) suggests that primary urethral pain syndrome may be a form of PBPS. Mechanisms thought to be basic for PBPS may also apply to the urethra. This means that the specific testing with potassium has been used to support the theory of epithelial leakage [156,157]. Another possible mechanism is neuropathic hypersensitivity following urinary tract infection. The relationship with gynaecological and obstetric aspects is unclear. In a small group of patients with urethral pain, it has been found that grand multi-parity and delivery without episiotomy were more often seen in patients with urethral syndrome, using univariate analysis [158].
