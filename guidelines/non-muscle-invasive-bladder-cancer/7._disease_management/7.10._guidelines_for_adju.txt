7.10. Guidelines for adjuvant therapy in TaT1 tumours and for therapy of carcinoma in situ. General recommendationsStrength ratingCounsel smokers to stop smoking.StrongThe type of further therapy after transurethral resection of the bladder (TURB) should be based on the risk groups shown in Section 6.3 and Table 6.1. For determination of a patient’s risk group use the 2021 EAU risk group calculator available at www.nmibc.net.StrongIn patients with tumours presumed to be at low risk and in those with small papillary recurrences (presumably Ta LG/G1) detected more than one year after previous TURB, offer one immediate single chemotherapy instillation.StrongOffer post-operative saline or water continuous irrigation of the bladder to patients who cannot receive a single instillation of chemotherapy.StrongPatients with small recurrent low-grade Ta tumours can be effectively and safely offered office fulguration.StrongOnly offer active surveillance to selected patients with presumed low-grade tumours not amendable to endoscopic ablation.WeakIn patients with intermediate-risk tumours (with or without immediate instillation), offer instillations of chemotherapy (the optimal schedule is not known) or one-year full-dose Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) treatment (induction plus 3-weekly instillations at 3, 6 and 12 months). Chemotherapy is a reasonable first option in the majority of cases; however, the final choice should be made in a shared decision-making process with the patient, reflecting his/her risk of recurrence and progression, as well as the efficacy and side effects of each treatment modality.StrongAdminister a full-dose intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) for one to three years in patients with high-risk tumours (a complete BCG schedule comprises an induction phase of six-weekly instillations, followed by a maintenance phase of three-weekly instillations at 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30 and 36 months, respectively). The additional beneficial effect of the second and third years of maintenance should be weighed against its added costs, side effects and access to BCG. Immediate radical cystectomy (RC) may also be discussed with the patient.StrongDiscuss immediate RC in patients with very high-risk tumours. Intravesical full-dose BCG instillations for one to three years remains an option for selected patients, particularly those who decline or are unfit for RC.StrongOffer transurethral resection of the prostate, followed by intravesical instillation of BCG to patients with CIS in the epithelial lining of the prostatic urethra if a bladder sparing strategy is considered.WeakCautiously offer quinolones to treat BCG-related side effects*.WeakThe definition of ‘BCG-unresponsive’ should be respected as it most precisely defines the patients who are unlikely to respond to further BCG instillations.StrongOffer a RC to patients with BCG-unresponsive tumours.StrongOffer patients with BCG-unresponsive tumours, who are not candidates for RC due to comorbidities, preservation strategies (intravesical chemotherapy, chemotherapy and microwave-induced hyperthermia, electromotive administration of chemotherapy, intravesical- or systemic immunotherapy; preferably within clinical trials).WeakDiscuss high-risk and very high-risk patients within a multidisciplinary board, when possible.WeakRecommendations - technical aspects for treatmentIntravesical chemotherapyIf given, administer a single immediate instillation of chemotherapy within 24 hours after TURB.WeakOmit a single immediate instillation of chemotherapy in any case of overt or suspected bladder perforation or bleeding requiring bladder irrigation.StrongThe optimal schedule and duration of further intravesical chemotherapy instillation is not defined; however, it should not exceed one year.WeakIf intravesical chemotherapy is given, use the drug at its optimal pH and maintain the concentration of the drug by reducing fluid intake before and during instillation.StrongThe length of individual instillation should be a minimum of one, and up to two hours.WeakBCG intravesical immunotherapyAbsolute contraindications of BCG intravesical instillation are:during the first two weeks after TURB;in patients with visible haematuria;after traumatic catheterisation;in patients with symptomatic urinary tract infection.Strong *The side-effect profile of quinolones and fluoroquinolones resulted in the adoption of European regulation restricting their use.
