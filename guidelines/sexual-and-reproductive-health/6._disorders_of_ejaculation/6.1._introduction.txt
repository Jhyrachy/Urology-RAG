6.1. Introduction. Ejaculation is a complex physiological process that comprises emission and expulsion processes and is mediated by interwoven neurological and hormonal pathways [531]. Any interference with those pathways may cause a wide range of ejaculatory disorders. The spectrum of ejaculation disorders includes premature ejaculation (PE), retarded or delayed ejaculation, anejaculation, painful ejaculation, retrograde ejaculation, anorgasmia and haemospermia.
