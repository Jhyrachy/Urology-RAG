4.9.1. Epidemiology, aetiology, pathophysiology. Urethral diverticulum is an uncommon condition with an estimated prevalence of 1â€“6%. A prevalence of up to 10% was reported among women with LUTS attending a tertiary referral centre [738]. However, as many patients are asymptomatic or misdiagnosed, the true incidence is unknown [739-741]. Given the rarity of the condition, most published series are small and single institutional. Urethral diverticulum is thought to arise from repeated obstruction, infection, and subsequent rupture of peri-urethral glands into the urethral lumen, resulting in an epithelialised cavity that communicates with the urethra [739]. Iatrogenic damage to the urethra may also play a role, as up to 20% of women with urethral diverticula are noted to have a history of urethral surgery, dilation, or traumatic delivery [739,742]. Iatrogenic urethral diverticula formation associated with synthetic sub-urethral sling has also been reported [743-745].
