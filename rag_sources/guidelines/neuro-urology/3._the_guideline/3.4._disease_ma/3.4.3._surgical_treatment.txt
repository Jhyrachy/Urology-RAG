3.4.3.2. denervation, deafferentation, sacral neuromodulation sacral anterior root stimulation (sars) aimed producing detrusor contraction. technique developed brindley applicable complete lesions

rhizotomy, also known sacral deafferentation, achieved success reducing ndo [348-350], nowadays, used mostly adjuvant sars [342,351-354]. alternatives rhizotomy sought treatment combination [355-357]. growing evidence, including one rct , use sacral neuromodulation treating neuro-urological symptoms, due paucity disease specific studies remains unclear neurological patients suitable [359-361]. ms patients ndo often reported good responders several types neuromodulations [361-363]. neuromodulation effect urodynamic parameters still unclear . development mri-compatible pulse generators leads,

however, lifelong follow-up essential patient group given significant morbidity associated procedure . 3.4.3.5. urinary diversion therapy successful, urinary diversion must considered protection uut . continent diversion: first choice urinary diversion. patients limited dexterity anatomical barriers (e.g., urethral strictures, women poor mobility and/or obesity) may prefer stoma instead using urethra catheterisation. cosmetic reasons, umbilicus often used stoma site [386-392]. sr literature concluded continent catheterisable tubes/stomas effective treatment option neuro-urological patients

complications related concomitant procedures (augmentation cystoplasty, pouch) included neovesicocutaneous fistulae (3.4%), bladder stones (20-25%), bladder perforations (up 40% one case series) .
