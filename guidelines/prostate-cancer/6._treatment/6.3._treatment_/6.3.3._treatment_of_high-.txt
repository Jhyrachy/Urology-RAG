6.3.3. Treatment of high-risk localised disease. Patients with high-risk PCa are at an increased risk of PSA failure, need for secondary therapy, metastatic progression and death from PCa. Nevertheless, not all high-risk PCa patients have a uniformly poor prognosis after RP [780]. When managed with non-curative intent, high-risk PCa is associated with 10-year and 15-year PCSM rates of 28.8 and 35.5%, respectively [781]. There is no consensus regarding the optimal treatment of men with high-risk PCa. Some evidence suggests that radical treatment for high-risk PCa can be delayed up to three months after the diagnosis without any oncological consequences [782,783]. Systematic reviews suggest that there is a higher risk of biochemical recurrence and worse pathological outcomes when definitive treatment is given beyond a 6 to 9 months delay. However, there is no conclusive data regarding stronger endpoints (CSS or OS). 6.3.3.1. Radical prostatectomy Provided that the tumour is not fixed to the pelvic wall or there is no invasion of the urethral sphincter, RP is a standard option in selected patients with a low tumour volume. ePLND provides accurate LN staging. Pre-operative PSMA-PET/CT is more accurate for staging generally, but can miss smaller LNs (especially LNs <5mm). ePLND may also miss LN metastasis [539,784]. Risks and benefits of pelvic LN dissection vs. PSMA PET/CT should be discussed with the patient pre-operatively. Patients should be aware pre-operatively that surgery may be part of multi-modal treatment, with adjuvant or SRT or ADT. Neoadjuvant therapy using ADT with or without new generation HT or docetaxel is not indicated. (See Section 6.1.2.2.4) [785,786]. Nerve sparing management is discussed in Section 6.1.2.3.5. At 15 years follow-up cN0 patients who undergo RP but who were found to have pN1 were reported to have an overall CSS and OS of 45% and 42%, respectively [787,788]. A SR has reported 10-year BCR-free, CSS, and OS rates ranging from 28% to 56%, 72% to 98%, and 60% to 87.6%, respectively, in pN1 patients [789]. These findings highlight that pN1 patients represent a very heterogeneous patient group and further treatment must be individualised based on risk factors (see Sections 6.2.5.2 and 6.2.5.6). 6.3.3.2. External beam radiation therapy For high-risk localised PCa, a combined modality approach should be used consisting of IMRT/VMAT plus long-term ADT. The duration of ADT has to take into account PS, comorbidities and the number of poor prognostic factors. It is important to recognise that in several studies EBRT plus short-term ADT did not improve OS in high-risk localised PCa and long-term ADT (at least 2 to 3 years) is currently recommended for these patients [677,678,689]. Moderate HFX is an option in selected high-risk patients with localised disease. The CHHiP study included 12% high-risk patients (n = 386) but limited entry to those with a PSA < 30 ng/mL and a Roach formula risk of SV involvement < 30% [661]. Patients were ineligible if they had both T3a tumours and ISUP grade group 4 or higher. 6.3.3.2.1. Lymph node irradiation in cN0 There is no clear evidence for prophylactic irradiation of the pelvic LNs in intermediate- and high-risk disease. The long-term results of the NRG/RTOG 9413-trial which randomised intermediate-risk and high-risk localised PCa patients (1,322 cN0 patients were enrolled), showed that neoadjuvant HT plus whole pelvic RT improved PFS only compared with neoadjuvant ADT plus prostate RT and whole pelvic RT plus adjuvant ADT [790]. However, at the increased risk of ≥ grade 3 GI-toxicity. A well-conducted single-centre RCT randomised 224 patients comparing prostate-only RT (PORT) vs. whole pelvic RT (WPRT) in localised high-risk- and locally-advanced tumours (cN0) with a risk of > 20% of positive nodes (Roach formula). With a median follow-up of 68 months there was a significant improvement of distant MFS (95.9% vs. 89.2%, HR: 0.35, p = 0.01) and DFS (89.5% vs.77.2%, p = 0.02). However, there was a significant higher rate of late GU ≥ 2 effects (17.7% vs. 7.5%, p = 0.02), the trial was relatively small in size with additional limitations and these findings are therefore insufficient to define a change in practice [791,792]. The benefits of pelvic nodal irradiation using IMRT/VMAT merit further investigation in large scale RCTs as conducted by the RTOG or the UK National Cancer Research Institute (NCRI). 6.3.3.2.2. Brachytherapy boost In men with NCCN unfavourable intermediate- or high-risk PCa, BT boost with supplemental EBRT and HT may be considered. See Sections 6.1.3.4.1 and 6.1.3.4.2 for details on RCTs comparing EBRT alone and EBRT with LDR or HDR boost, respectively. 6.3.3.3. Options other than surgery or radiotherapy for the primary treatment of localised PCa Currently there is a lack of evidence supporting any other treatment option apart from RP and radical RT in localised high-risk PCa. The use of ADT monotherapy was addressed by the EORTC 30891 trial [773] (see Section 6.2.4.4.2). Immediate ADT may only benefit patients with a PSA-DT < twelve months, and either a PSA > 50 ng/mL or a poorly-differentiated tumour [773,793]. 6.3.3.4.
