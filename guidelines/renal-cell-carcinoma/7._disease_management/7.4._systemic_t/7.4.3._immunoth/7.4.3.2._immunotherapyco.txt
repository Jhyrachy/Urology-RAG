7.4.3.2. Immunotherapy/combination therapy. The phase III trial CheckMate 214 (NCT 02231749) showed a superiority of nivolumab and ipilimumab over sunitinib. The primary endpoint population focused on the IMDC intermediate- and poor-risk population where the combination demonstrated an OS benefit (HR: 0.63, 95% CI: 0.44-0.89) which led to regulatory approval [499] and a paradigm shift in the treatment of mRCC [565]. Results from CheckMate 214 further established that the combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab was associated with higher response rates (RR) (39% in the ITT population), complete RR (8% in the ITT population [central radiology review]) and duration of response compared to sunitinib. Progression-free survival did not achieve the pre-defined endpoint. The exploratory analysis of OS data in the PD-L1-positive population was 0.45 (95% CI: 0.29-0.41). A recent update with 60-month data shows ongoing benefits for the immune combination with independently assessed complete response rates of 11% and a HR for OS in the IMDC intermediate- and poor-risk group of 0.68 (0.58-0.81) [520]. However, this complete response rate has not been consistent across trials for this combination (the Cosmic313 study showed complete response rates of 3% [566]). In CheckMate 214 the 60-months OS probability was 43% for ipilimumab plus nivolumab vs. 31% for sunitinib, respectively [567]. In this update the IMDC good-risk group did not continue to perform better with sunitinib although this effect occurs due to a late overlap of the Kaplan-Meier curves (HR for OS: 0.94 [95% CI: 0.65-1.37]) [567]. Nivolumab plus ipilimumab was associated with 46% grade III-IV toxicity and 1.5% treatment-related deaths. It should therefore be administered in centres with experience of immune combination therapy and appropriate supportive care within the context of a multidisciplinary team (LE: 4). PD-L1 biomarker is currently not used to select patients for therapy. The frequency of steroid use has generated controversy and further analysis, as well as real world data, are required. For these reasons the Panel continues to recommend ipilimumab and nivolumab in the intermediate- and poor-risk population. The KEYNOTE-426 trial (NCT02853331 reported results for the combination of axitinib plus pembrolizumab vs. sunitinib in 861 treatment-naive cc-mRCC patients [568]. Overall survival and PFS assessed by central independent review in the ITT population were the co-primary endpoints. Response rates and assessment in the PD-L1-positive patient population were secondary endpoints. With a minimum follow-up of 35.6 months (median 42.8 months) this trial demonstrated an ongoing OS benefit for axitinib plus pembrolizumab in the ITT population (HR: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.60-0.88, p < 0.001). Median OS for axitinib plus pembrolizumab was 45.7 months (95% CI: 43.6 - NR) vs. 40.1 month (95% CI: 34.3 - 44.2) for sunitinib with a PFS benefit (HR: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.58-0.80, p < 0.0001) which was shown across all IMDC subgroups for PFS, while OS was similar between axitinib plus pembrolizumab vs. sunitinib in the favourable subgroup with an OS benefit in the IMDC intermediate- and poor-risk groups. The complete response rate by independent review was 10% in the pembrolizumab plus axitinib arm and 4% in the sunitinib arm [569]. With an extended median follow-up of 67 months median OS was 47.2 months (43.6-54.8) vs. 40.8 months (34.3-47.5; HR 0.84 95%CI: 0.71-0.99)) for sunitib, median PFS was 15.7 (13.6-20.2) vs. 11.1 (8.9-12.5) HR 0.69 (95% CI: 0.59-0.81) and ORR was 60.6% (CR 11.6%) vs. 39.6% (CR 4.0%) [570]. Treatment-related adverse events (≥ grade III) occurred in 63% of patients receiving axitinib and pembrolizumab vs. 58% of patients receiving sunitinib. Treatment- related deaths occurred in approximately 1% in both arms [568]. The phase III CheckMate 9ER trial randomised 651 patients to nivolumab plus cabozantinib (n = 323) or vs. sunitinib (n = 328) in treatment-naive cc-mRCC patients [456]. The primary endpoint of PFS assessed by central independent review in the ITT population was significantly prolonged for nivolumab plus cabozantinib (16.6 months) vs. sunitinib (8.3 months, HR: 0.51, 95% CI: 0.41-0.64, p < 0.0001). The nivolumab/cabozantinib combination also demonstrated a significant OS benefit in the secondary endpoint compared with sunitinib (HR: 0.60, CI: 0.40-0.89, p = 0.0010) after a median follow-up of 18.1 months in the initial report [571]. The independently assessed ORR was 55.7% vs. 27.1% with a complete response rate of 8% for nivolumab plus cabozantinib vs. 4.6% with sunitinib. The efficacy was observed independent of IMDC group and PD-L1 status. Treatment-related adverse events (> grade III) occurred in 61% of patients receiving cabozantinib and nivolumab vs. 51% of patients receiving sunitinib. Treatment-related deaths occurred in one patient in the nivolumab/cabozantinib arm and in two patients in the sunitinib arm. With an extended follow-up with median 44 months the median OS was 49.5 months (40.3-not estimable) in the nivolumab plus cabozantinib patients vs. 35.5 months (29.2-42.3) in the sunitinib treated patients (HR: 0.70 [95% CI: 0.56-0.87, p = 0.0043). The updated median PFS was 16.6 months (12.8-19.5) vs. 8.4 months (7.0-9.7; HR 0.59 [95% CI: 0.49-0.71], p < 0·0001 [572]. The randomised phase III trial CLEAR (Lenvatinib/Everolimus or Lenvatinib/Pembrolizumab vs. Sunitinib Alone as Treatment of Advanced RCC) was published [573]. CLEAR randomised a total of 1,069 patients (in a 1:1:1 ratio) to lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab (n = 355) vs. lenvatinib plus everolimus (n = 357) vs. sunitinib (n = 357). The trial reached its primary endpoint of independently assessed PFS at a median of 23.9 vs. 9.2 months, for lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab vs. sunitinib, respectively (HR: 0.39, 95% CI: 0.32-0.49, p < 0.001). Overall survival significantly improved with lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab vs. sunitinib (HR: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.49-0.88, p = 0.005). Objective response for lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab was 71% with 16% of the patients having a complete remission. In the final analyis with a median follow-up of 49.8 months median OS was 53.7 months (48.7-not estimable) for lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab vs. 54.3 (40.9-not estimable; HR 0.79 95% CI: 0.63-0.99) for sunitinib [574]. Efficacy was observed across all IMDC risk groups, independently of PD-L1 status. Treatment-related adverse events (> grade III) with lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab were 72%. Treatment-related death occurred in four patients in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab arm and in one patient in the sunitinib arm. The JAVELIN trial investigated 886 patients in a phase III RCT of avelumab plus axitinib vs. sunitinib [501]. The trial met one of its co-primary endpoints (PFS in the PD-L1-positive population at first interim analysis [median follow up 11.5 months]). Hazard ratios for PFS and OS in the ITT population were 0.69 (95% CI: 0.56-0.84) and 0.78 (95% CI: 0.55-1.08), respectively, but with a missing significant OS improvement also with longer follow-up [575] and in the third interim analyis with a median follow-up of 34.1 months [576]. The same applies to the atezolizumab/bevacizumab combination (IMmotion151) which also achieved a PFS advantage over sunitinib in the PD-L1-positive population at interim analysis and ITT (HR: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.57-0.96), but has not shown a significant OS advantage at final analysis (HR: 0.91 [95% CI: 0.76-1.08], p = 0.27) [554,577]. Therefore, these combinations cannot currently be recommended. In IMDC favourable patients the treatment with axitinib+pembrolizumab (Keynote-426), cabozantinib+nivolumab (CheckMate-9ER) and lenvatinib+pembrolizumab (CLEAR) improved PFS and objective response rate, but not OS [570,572,574]. Given the long-term follow-up with no OS improvement by the respective TKI+IO combination vs sunitinib, TKI monotherapy becomes a standard of care as an additiional choice in IMDC favourable patients. Although sunitinib was the TKI monotherapy used in theses trials, pazopanib is a valid alternative based on the non-inferiority data of the phase III trial COMPARZ [539]. The COSMIC-313 trial is the first RCT to evaluate a triple combination of cabozantinib (40 mg) plus nivolumab plus ipilimumab vs. nivolumab plus ipilimumab, a current standard of care, in 855 patients with IMDC intermediate- and poor-risk [578]. The primary endpoint of PFS improvement, measured in a PFS ITT of 550 patient was met after 249 events occurred with a HR 0.73 (95% CI: 0.57-0.94, p = 0.013) favouring the triplet therapy. Median PFS was not reached (14.0-NE) vs. 11.3 months (7.7-18.2) in the control arm with a median follow-up of 20.2 months. Overall survival has yet to be reported. Objective response was 43% vs. 36% in the triplet vs. the control arm with a complete response rate of 3% in both arms. Treatment-related adverse events (> grade III) with cabozantinib plus nivolumab plus ipilimumab were 73% vs. 41% in the nivolumab plus ipilimumab control arm. The use of high-dose steroids (> = 40 mg prednisolone or equivalent) was 58% (triplet) vs. 35%. (control). Treatment discontinuation rate of any agent was high in the triplet arm (45%) compared to the doublet (24%), whilst discontinuation of all treatments due to the same adverse events was 12% vs. 5% in the control arm. Although the primary endpoint of PFS was met, objective response rates of the triplet combination are modest as known for TKI + IO doublets. Treatment-related adverse events are high with a high rate of treatment discontinuation. As the OS rate is currently unknown, the additional benefit of this triplet therapy compared to standard immune-based doublet therapy is still uncertain.

Patients who stop nivolumab plus ipilimumab because of toxicity require expert guidance and support from a multidisciplinary team before re-challenge can occur (LE: 1). Patients who do not receive the full four doses of ipilimumab due to toxicity should continue on single-agent nivolumab, where safe and feasible (LE: 4). Treatment past progression with nivolumab plus ipilimumab can be justified but requires close scrutiny and the support of an expert multidisciplinary team [499,581] (LE: 1). Patients who stop TKI and IO due to immune-related toxicity can receive single-agent TKI once the adverse events has resolved (LE: 1). Adverse event management, including transaminitis and diarrhoea, require particular attention as both agents may be causative. Expert advice should be sought on re-challenge of ICIs after significant toxicity (LE: 4). Treatment past progression on axitinib plus pembrolizumab or nivolumab plus cabozantinib requires careful consideration as it is biologically distinct from treatment past progression on ipilimumab and nivolumab. Based on Panel consensus, nivolumab plus ipilimumab, pembrolizumab plus axitinib and nivolumab plus cabozantinib and lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab should be administered in centres with experience of immune combination therapy and appropriate supportive care within the context of a multidisciplinary team (LE: 4).
