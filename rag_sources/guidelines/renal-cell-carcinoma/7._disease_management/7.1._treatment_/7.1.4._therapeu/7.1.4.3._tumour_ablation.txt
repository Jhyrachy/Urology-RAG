furthermore, patients high-grade rcc metastasis may choose different treatments tumour ablation. finally, patients without biopsy non-diagnostic biopsy often assumed rcc undergo potentially unnecessary radiological follow-up treatment. 7.1.4.3.2. cryoablation cryoablation performed using either percutaneous- laparoscopic-assisted approach, technical success rates > 95% . comparative studies, significant difference overall complication rates laparoscopic- percutaneous cryoablation [395-397]. one comparative study reported similar os, css, rfs 145 laparoscopic patients longer
