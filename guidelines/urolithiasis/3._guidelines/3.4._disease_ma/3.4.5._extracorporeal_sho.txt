3.4.5. Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (SWL). The success of SWL depends on the efficacy of the lithotripter and the following factors: size, location (ureteral, pelvic, or calyceal), and composition (hardness) of the stones (Section 3.4.9.3);patient’s habitus (Section 3.4.10.3);performance of SWL (best practice, see below). Each of these factors significantly influences the retreatment rate and outcome of SWL. Best clinical practiceStentingRoutine use of internal stents before SWL does not improve stone-free rates (SFRs), nor lowers the number of auxiliary treatments. It may, however, reduce the formation of steinstrasse [135-138]. PacemakerPatients with a pacemaker can be treated with SWL, provided that appropriate technical precautions are taken. Patients with implanted cardioverter defibrillators must be managed with special care (firing mode temporarily reprogrammed during SWL treatment). However, this might not be necessary with new-generation lithotripters [139]. Shock wave rateLowering shock wave frequency from 120 to 60-90 shock waves/min improves SFRs [140-148]. Ultraslow frequency of 30 shock waves/min may increase SFR [149]. Tissue damage increases with shock wave frequency [150-153]. Number of shock waves, energy setting, and repeat treatment sessionsThe number of shock waves that can be delivered at each session depends on the type of lithotripter and shock wave power. There is no consensus on the maximum number of shock waves [154]. Starting SWL on a lower energy setting with stepwise power (and SWL sequence) ramping can achieve vasoconstriction during treatment [150], which prevents renal injury [155-157]. Animal studies [158] and a prospective randomised study [159] have shown better SFRs (96% vs. 72%) using stepwise power ramping, but no difference has been found for fragmentation or evidence of complications after SWL, irrespective of whether ramping was used [160,161]. There are no conclusive data on the intervals required between repeated SWL sessions. However, clinical experience indicates that repeat sessions are feasible (within one day for ureteral stones) [162]. Improvement of acoustic couplingProper acoustic coupling between the cushion of the treatment head and the patient’s skin is important. Defects (air pockets) in the coupling gel deflect 99% of shock waves [163]. Gentle swiping between the coupled therapy head and the patient skin helps remove air bubbles and improves the coupling [164]. Ultrasound gel is probably the most widely-used agent available as a lithotripsy coupling agent [165]. Procedural controlResults of treatment are operator-dependent, and experienced clinicians obtain better results. During the procedure, careful imaging control of localisation contributes to outcome quality [166]. Pain ControlCareful control of pain during treatment is necessary to limit pain-induced movements and excessive respiratory excursions [167-170]. Antibiotic prophylaxisNo standard antibiotic prophylaxis before SWL is recommended. However, prophylaxis is recommended in the case of internal stent placement ahead of anticipated treatments and in the presence of increased bacterial burden (e.g., indwelling catheter, nephrostomy tube, or infectious stones) [62,171,172]. Medical therapy after extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsyDespite conflicting results, most RCTs and several MAs support MET after SWL for ureteral or renal stones as an adjunct to expedite expulsion and increase SFRs. Medical expulsion therapy might also reduce analgesic requirements [173]. Post-treatment managementMechanical percussion and diuretic therapy can significantly improve SFRs and accelerate stone passage after SWL [174]. Complications of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsyCompared to percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) and ureteroscopy (URS), there are fewer overall complications with SWL [175] (Table 3.8). In a Meta-Analysis of 115 RCT´s 18.43% of Clavien I–II complications and 2.48% of Clavien III–IV complications occurred [175]. The relationship between SWL and hypertension or diabetes is unclear. Published data are contradictory; however, no evidence exists supporting the hypothesis that SWL may cause long-term adverse effects [176-182].
