3.3. Histology and classification. 3.3.1. Histological types Upper urinary tract tumours are almost always UCs with pure non-urothelial histology being rare [69,70]. However, histological subtypes are present in approximately 25% of UTUCs [71,72]. Pure squamous cell carcinoma of the urinary tract is often assumed to be associated with chronic inflammatory diseases and infections arising from urolithiasis [73,74]. Urothelial carcinoma with divergent squamous differentiation (i.e., squamous subtype) is present in approximately 15% of cases [73]. Keratinising squamous metaplasia of urothelium is a risk factor for squamous cell cancers and therefore mandates surveillance. Upper urinary tract UCs with different subtypes are high- grade and have a worse prognosis compared to pure UC [72,75,76]. Other subtypes, although rare, include sarcomatoid with inverted growth also being is frequent in the UUT [76,77]. Collecting duct carcinomas, which may seem to share similar characteristics with UCs, display a unique transcriptomic signature similar to renal cancer, with a putative cell of origin in the distal convoluted tubules. Therefore, collecting duct carcinomas are considered as renal tumours [78].
