4.1.4.2.1.3. Anticholinergic drugs: adherence and persistence. Most studies on anticholinergic medication are short term (twelve weeks). Adherence in clinical trials is considered to be higher than in clinical practice [177]. Discontinuation rates were high for tolterodine at twelve months, and particularly high (68–95%) for oxybutynin. Two open-label extensions of RCTs of fesoterodine8 mg showed adherence rates at two years of 49–84% [178,179]. A longitudinal disease analyser database study has indicated an increasing discontinuation rate, following treatment with anticholinergics, from 74.8% at one year to 87% at three years [180]. Several of the RCTs tried to identify the factors associated with low/lower adherence or persistence of anticholinergics. These were identified as: low level of efficacy (41.3%);adverse events (22.4%);cost (18.7%), although higher adherence rates were observed when drugs were provided at no cost to patients [181]. Other factors associated with poor adherence included: immediate release formulations (lower persistence compared with ER formulations);age (lower persistence among younger adults);unrealistic expectations of treatment;gender distribution (better adherence/persistence in female patients);ethnic group (African–Americans and other ethnic minorities are more likely to discontinue or switch treatment).
