7.5.3. Chemotherapy. Chemotherapy alone rarely produces durable complete remissions. In general, a clinical complete response rate of up to 56% is reported in some series, which must be weighed against a staging error of > 60% [432,433]. Response to chemotherapy is a prognostic factor for treatment outcome and eventual survival although it may be confounded by patient selection [434]. Several groups have reported the effect of chemotherapy on resectable tumours (neoadjuvant approach), as well as unresectable primary tumours [263,274,435,436]. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with two to three cycles of MVAC or CMV has led to a down-staging of the primary tumour in various prospective series [263,274,435]. A bladder-conserving strategy with TURB and systemic cisplatin-based chemotherapy has been reported several years ago and could lead to long-term survival with intact bladder in a highly selected patient population [437]. A recent large retrospective analysis of a U.S. National Cancer Database cohort reported on 1,538 patients treated with TURB and multi-agent chemotherapy [438]. The two and 5-year OS for all patients was 49% and 32.9% and for cT2 patients it was 52.6% and 36.2%, respectively. While these data show that longterm survival with intact bladder can be achieved in a subset of patients it is not recommended for routine use. 7.5.3.1. Summary of evidence and guideline for chemotherapy Summary of evidenceLEComplete and partial local responses have been reported with cisplatin-based chemotherapy as primary therapy for locally-advanced tumours in highly selected patients.2b RecommendationStrength ratingDo not offer chemotherapy alone as primary therapy for localised bladder cancer.Strong
