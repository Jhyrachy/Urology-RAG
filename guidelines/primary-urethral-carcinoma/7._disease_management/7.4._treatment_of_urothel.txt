7.4. Treatment of urothelial carcinoma of the prostate. Local conservative treatment with extensive TUR and subsequent BCG instillation is effective in patients with Ta or Tis prostatic urethral carcinoma [89]. A systematic review reported patients treated with TURP before BCG show a better local response in the prostatic urethra with a higher disease-free survival (80–100% vs. 63–89%) and progression free survival (PFS) (90–100% vs. 75–94%) than patients in studies in which no TURP was performed [91]. Risk of understaging local extension of prostatic urethral cancer at TUR is high in patients with ductal or stromal involvement [90]. Some earlier series have reported superior oncological results for the initial use of radical cystoprostatectomy as a primary treatment option in patients with ductal involvement [91,92]. In 24 patients with prostatic stromal invasion treated with radical cystoprostatectomy, a LN mapping study found that twelve patients had positive LNs, with an increased proportion located above the iliac bifurcation [93]. 7.4.1. Summary of evidence and guidelines for the treatment of urothelial carcinoma of the prostate Summary of evidenceLEPatients undergoing TUR of the prostate for prostatic urothelial carcinoma prior to BCG treatment show superior complete response rates compared to those who do not.3 RecommendationsStrength ratingOffer a urethra-sparing approach with transurethral resection (TUR) and bacillus-Calmette Guérin (BCG) to patients with non-invasive urethral carcinoma or carcinoma in situ of the prostatic urethra and prostatic ducts.StrongIn patients not responding to BCG, or in patients with extensive ductal or stromal involvement, perform a cystoprostatectomy with extended pelvic lymphadenectomy.Weak
