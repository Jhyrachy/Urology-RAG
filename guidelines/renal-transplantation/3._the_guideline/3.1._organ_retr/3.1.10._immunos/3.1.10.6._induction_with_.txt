3.1.10.6. Induction with Interleukin-2 receptor antibodies. Basiliximab, a high-affinity anti-interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor monoclonal antibody is approved for rejection prophylaxis following organ transplantation [243,244,246,335-339]. Basiliximab is given before transplantation and on day four post-transplant. The drug is safe, and IL-2 receptor antibodies have been shown in RCTs to reduce the prevalence of acute cellular rejection by approximately 40% [243,244,246,335-337]. Meta-analyses [246,335-337] have confirmed the efficacy, although no positive effect on patient or graft survival could be demonstrated, large retrospective cohort studies and recent large prospective studies suggest such a benefit [243,244,340,341]. Several large controlled trials support the efficacy and safety of quadruple therapy with tacrolimus, mycophenolate and steroids. Interleukin-2 receptor antibodies may allow early steroid withdrawal [297], although higher rejection rates were described in some studies. Most importantly, IL-2 receptor antibodies allow a substantial reduction in CNIs or steroids, while maintaining excellent efficacy and renal function [243-246,304,335-337]. Therefore, this regimen is proposed as first-line immunosuppression in patients with low to normal immunological risk [244,341]. RecommendationStrength ratingUse interleukin-2 receptor antibodies for induction in patients with normal immunological risk in order to reduce incidence of acute rejection.Weak
