10.1.3.1. medical management – first-line treatment. first-line medical treatments ischaemic priapism 4 hours duration strongly recommended surgical treatment. conversely, first-line treatments initiated beyond 48 hours, relieving priapism, little documented benefit terms long-term erectile function preservation. likely consequence irreversible smooth muscle hypoxia damage begins established approximately 48 hours onset ischaemia [1340-1342]. shown series 50 patients low-flow priapism successfully treated followed-up mean 66 months, priapism lasting 48 hours significant risk ed . historically, several first-line treatments described including exercise, ejaculation, ice packs, cold baths, cold water enemas . however, limited evidence benefit measures may even exacerbate condition scd patients. success rates conservative measures alone rarely reported. small series, cold water enemas reported induce detumescence six ten cases . another study 24.5% 122 patients achieved detumescence following priapic episodes lasting 6 hours cooling penis perineum, walking upstairs . 10.1.3.1.1. penile anaesthesia/analgesia blood aspiration intracavernous injection sympathomimetic agent performed without anaesthesia; however, anaesthesia may necessary severe penile pain. whilst anaesthesia may alleviate ischaemic pain, cutaneous anaesthesia facilitates subsequent therapies. treatment options penile anaesthesia/systemic analgesia include: dorsal nerve block;circumferential penile block;subcutaneous local penile shaft block;oral conscious sedation (for paediatric patients). 10.1.3.1.2. aspiration ± irrigation 0.9% w/v saline solution first intervention episode priapism lasting 4 hours consists corporal blood aspiration drain stagnant blood corporal bodies, making possible relieve compartment-syndrome-like condition within corpus cavernosum. blood aspiration may performed intracorporeal access either glans via percutaneous needle access lateral aspect proximal penile shaft, using 16 18 g angio-catheter butterfly needle. needle must penetrate skin, subcutaneous tissue tunica albuginea drain blood corpus cavernosum. clinicians advocate using two angiocatheters butterfly needles time accelerate drainage, well aspirating irrigating simultaneously saline solution . aspiration continued bright red, oxygenated blood aspirated. several case series reported outcomes first-line treatments; however, cases, aspiration irrigation combined intracavernosal injection sympathomimetic agents , thus making difficult draw conclude success rate aspiration + irrigation alone . overall, case series retrospective studies reported success rate ranging 0 100% cases . rct, 70 patients ischaemic priapism lasting 6 hours secondary intracavernosal injection treated aspiration plus saline irrigation different temperatures . study reported 85% success rate optimum results achieved using 10°c saline infusion blood aspiration. insufficient data determine whether aspiration followed saline intracorporeal irrigation effective aspiration alone. 10.1.3.1.3. aspiration ± irrigation 0.9% w/v saline solution combination intracavernous injection pharmacological agents. combination currently considered standard care treatment ischaemic priapism . pharmacological agents include sympathomimetic drugs α-adrenergic agonists. intracavernous sympathomimetic agents include phenylephrine, etilephrine, ephedrine, epinephrine, norepinephrine metaraminol resolution rate 80% [1336,1369,1371-1378]. use intracavernous adrenaline injection alone also sporadically reported . reported use sympathomimetic agent combined prior intracavernosal aspiration irrigation resolution ranging 80 100% cases compared 58% sympathomimetic injection alone . potential treatment-related adverse effects intracavernous phenylephrine (and sympathomimetic agents) include headache, dizziness, hypertension, reflex bradycardia, tachycardia palpitations sporadic subarachnoid haemorrhage . monitoring blood pressure pulse performed intracavernous administration sympathomimetic agents. intracavernous sympathomimetic agents cause hypertension, guidelines panel opinion agents contraindicated patients malignant poorly controlled hypertension, case reports significant cardiovascular neurological complications following use pharmacological agents priapism . similarly, data suggest sympathomimetic agents cause hypertensive crisis given monoamine oxidase inhibitors, hence medications used together . 10.1.3.1.4. intracavernosal oral pharmacological agents pharmacological agents treatment priapism discussed detail following section. table 38 summarises dosing administration agents. phenylephrine phenylephrine selective α-1-adrenergic receptor agonist observed small case series effective producing detumescence priapism, given intracavernosal injection, adverse effects . phenylephrine recommended adrenergic agonist drug choice due high selectivity α-1-adrenergic receptor, without concomitant β-mediated inotropic chronotropic cardiac effects . phenylephrine potential cardiovascular adverse effects recommended blood pressure pulse monitored every fifteen minutes one hour injection. particularly important older men pre-existing cardiovascular diseases. injection, puncture site compressed corpus cavernosum massaged facilitate drug distribution. etilephrine etilephrine also adrenergic agonist directly stimulates β adrenergic receptors . literature describing use etilephrine treatment priapism related men scd small retrospective case series reported benefits priapism secondary iatrogenic causes . etilephrine second widely used sympathomimetic agent . methylene blue methylene blue guanylate cyclase inhibitor, may potential inhibitor endothelial-mediated cavernous smooth muscle relaxation. small retrospective case series reported successful use treating short-term pharmacologically-induced priapism . treatment-related adverse effects include transient burning sensation blue discolouration penis. adrenaline adrenaline produces a-adrenergic receptor agonist β-adrenergic receptor activity. intracavernosal adrenaline used patients ischaemic priapism due intracavernous injection vasoactive agents. limited literature suggests adrenaline achieve detumescence short-term priapism, one small case series reporting success rate 50% single injection, overall success rate 95% repeated injections . β-2-agonists oral terbutaline β-2-agonist minor β-1 effects α-agonist activity; although mechanism action yet fully understood [1389-1391]. main use terbutaline prevention recurrent episodes prolonged erection. oral treatment terbutaline tested three placebo-controlled rcts [1390-1392] showing success rate 30 60% patients ischemic priapism associated intracavernous injection erectogenic agents. terbutaline given cautiously patients coronary artery disease, increased intravascular fluid volume, oedema hypokalaemia . single multi-centre prospective study, another β-2-agonist, salbutamol, reported induce detumescence 34% cases prolonged erection (more three hours) intracavernous injection erectogenic agents . however, robust data needed recommend oral salbutamol treatment ischaemic priapism. table 38: medical treatment ischaemic priapism drugdose/instructions usephenylephrineintracavernous injection 200 μg every 3-5 minutes.maximum dosage 1 mg within 1 hour.lower doses recommended children patients severe cardiovascular diseases.etilephrineintracavernosal injection concentration 2.5 mg 1-2 ml normal saline.methylene blueintracavernous injection 50-100 mg, left 5 minutes. aspirated penis compressed additional 5 minutes.adrenalineintracavernous injection 2 ml 1/100,000 adrenaline solution five times 20 minutes.terbutalineoral administration 5 mg priapism lasting 2.5 hours, intracavernous injection vasoactive agents. 10.1.3.1.5. management priapism related sickle cell disease results systematic review overall management priapism related scd found studies conducted exclusively patients scd studies mixed populations usually report separate data scd patients . clear systematic reporting patient characteristics, interventions outcomes lacking, length follow-up, reported, varied significantly among studies. overall, quality studies deemed poor allow high-quality, evidence-based recommendations made. urgent intervention essential general approach similar described cases ischaemic priapism co-ordinated haematologist [1394-1396]. however, haematological disorders, therapeutic interventions may also need implemented . specific measures scd-related priapism include intravenous hydration narcotic analgesia preparing patient aspiration irrigation. additionally, supplemental oxygen administration alkalinisation bicarbonate helpful . haemoglobin (hbs) percentage measured scd patients acute priapism. exchange blood transfusion also proposed, aim increasing tissue delivery oxygen . transfused blood sickle cell haemoglobin negative rh kell antigen matched ; however, evidence inconclusive whether exchange transfusion helps resolve priapism. systematic review reported mean time detumescence eleven days exchange transfusions compared eight days conventional treatment. moreover, nine cases aspen syndrome (association scd, priapism, exchange transfusion neurological events) consequence blood transfusion . series ten patients scd-related priapism showed safe perform exchange transfusion ; however, several reports suggest exchange transfusion may result serious neurological sequelae . therefore, routine use exchange transfusion recommended primary treatment intervention group unless risk scd-related symptoms. however, patients failed medical management, transfusion may required enable general anaesthesia safely administered prior definitive surgery .
