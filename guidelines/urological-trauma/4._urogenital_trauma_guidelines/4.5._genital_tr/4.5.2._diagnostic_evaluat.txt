4.5.2. Diagnostic evaluation. 4.5.2.1. Patient history and physical examination Penile fracture is associated with a sudden cracking or popping sound, pain and immediate detumescence. Local swelling of the penile shaft develops quickly, due to enlarging haematoma [240]. Bleeding may spread along the fascial layers of the penile shaft and extend to the lower abdominal wall if Buck’s fascia is also ruptured. Sometimes, the rupture of the tunica may be palpable. Less severe penile injuries can be distinguished from penile fracture, as they are not usually associated with detumescence [302]. Testicular rupture is associated with immediate pain, nausea, vomiting, and sometimes fainting. The hemiscrotum is tender, swollen, and ecchymotic. The testis itself may be difficult to palpate. Blunt vulvar or perineal trauma in women may be associated with bleeding, pain and voiding problems, bladder catheterisation is usually required. In genital trauma, a urinalysis should be performed. The presence of visible haematuria requires a retrograde urethrogram in males. In females, flexible or rigid cystoscopy is recommended to exclude urethral and bladder injury [326,328]. In women with genital injuries and blood at the vaginal introitus, further gynaecological investigation is needed [326].
