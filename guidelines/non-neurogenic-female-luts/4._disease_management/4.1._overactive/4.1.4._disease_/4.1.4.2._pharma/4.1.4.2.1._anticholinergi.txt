4.1.4.2.1. Anticholinergic drugs. Anticholinergic (antimuscarinic) drugs are currently the mainstay of treatment for OAB. Different agents vary in their pharmacological profiles, such as muscarinic receptor affinity and other modes of action and in their pharmacokinetic properties, such as lipid solubility and half-life. The Panel SR identified twelve studies (11,179 women) comparing antimuscarinics with placebo. Antimuscarinics were significantly more effective than placebo in improving mean symptom score on OABQ, reducing daily frequency episodes, reducing daily urgency episodes and UUI episodes, and increasing bladder functional capacity [11]. The SR established that antimuscarinics caused significantly higher adverse events than placebo including dry mouth, cognitive impairment, UTI and constipation [11]. Immediate-release (IR) anticholinergic preparations provide maximum dosage flexibility, including an off-label on-demand use. Immediate-release drugs have a greater risk of adverse effects than extended release (ER) formulations because of differing pharmacokinetics. A transdermal delivery system and gel developed for oxybutynin provide alternative formulations. On balance, IR formulations tend to be associated with more adverse effects compared to ER formulations [160]. A network meta-analysis of 128 RCTs including both genders comparing anticholinergics with placebo or other anticholinergics revealed that all anticholinergics, except imidafenacin, showed reasonable cure or improvement rates for OAB symptoms in both sexes [161]. Differences across the drugs in terms of alteration in symptoms were small. Cure of UUI is deemed to be the most important outcome measure. Table 1 shows a summary of the findings from a SR of RCTs including only women [162]. All agents showed superiority compared to placebo, but the absolute size of the effect was small.

The cure rates for darifenacin were not included in the US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) review. Continence rates were 29–33% for darifenacin compared to 17–18% for placebo [163]. Transdermal oxybutynin showed a significant improvement compared with placebo and other oral formulations in the number of incontinence episodes and micturitions per day but cure of UI was not reported as an outcome [163]. Oxybutynin topical gel was superior to placebo for improvement of UUI, with a higher proportion of participants being cured [163,164].
