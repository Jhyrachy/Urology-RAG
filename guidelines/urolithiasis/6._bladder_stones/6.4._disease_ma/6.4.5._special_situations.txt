6.4.5. Special situations. 6.4.5.1. Neurogenic bladder and stone formation A study of 2,825 spinal cord injury patients over eight years found a 3.3% incidence of bladder stones: 2% with CISC, 6.6% with an indwelling urethral catheter, 11% with a suprapubic catheter, and 1.1% in patients voiding using reflex micturition [766]. However, another study of 457 spinal cord injury patients for six months found no difference in bladder stones between urethral and suprapubic catheterisation [765]. Spinal cord injury patients with an indwelling urethral catheter are six times more likely to develop bladder stones than patients with normal micturition [764,766]. The risk of stone recurrence after complete removal in spinal cord injury patients is 16% per year [765]. An RCT of 78 spinal cord injury patients who perform CISC found a significant reduction in bladder stone formation when twice weekly manual bladder irrigations were performed for six months (49% vs. 0%, p = < 0.0001), as well as less symptomatic UTIs (41% vs. 8%; p = 0.001) [767]. However, this study excluded patients who developed autonomic dysreflexia during bladder irrigations. The irrigation volume used was not reported. 6.4.5.2. Bladder Augmentation The incidence of vesical calculus formation after bladder augmentation is 2-44% in adults [768-777], and 4-53% in children [777-791]. Following cystoplasty, stones form after 24-31 months in adults [769,771,776], and after 25-68 months in children [782,785,786,790,792-794]. The reported cumulative incidence of bladder stone formation after ten years is 28-36% and after twenty years is 41% [777,795]. Risk factors for bladder stone formation after augmentation include excess mucus production, incomplete bladder emptying, non-compliance with CIC or bladder irrigations, bacteriuria or urinary tract infections (due to urease-producing bacteria), foreign bodies (including staples, mesh, non-absorbable sutures), drainage by vesico-entero-cystostomy (Mitrofanoff or Monti) [435,769,772,774,775,782,786,789,795] and voiding by CISC compared with those voiding spontaneously [773]. Gastric segment augmentation confers a lower risk of bladder stones than ileal or colonic segment cystoplasty [778,782,786,789]. In previous stone formers, the rate of recurrence is 15-44% in adults [769-771,773,776], and 19-56% in children [435,777,778,782,784-787,789,794]. The risk of recurrence is greatest during the first two years, at about 12% per patient per year, with the risk decreasing with time [794]. Daily, or three-times-weekly bladder irrigations reduce the incidence of bladder stones following bladder augmentation or continent urinary diversion [435,772]. A randomised study found that daily bladder irrigation with 240 mL of saline reduced stone recurrences (p< 0.0002, p=0.0152) and symptomatic UTIs (p < 0.0001, p < 0.0001) compared to 60mL or 120mL [772]. The frequency of bladder irrigations required is unclear. 6.4.5.3. Urinary diversion The incidence of stone formation after urinary diversion with an ileal or colon conduit is 0-3% [796,797]. The incidence of stone formation is 0-34% in orthotopic ileal neobladders (Hautmann, hemi-Kock, Studer, T-pouch or w-neobladder) [433,773,797-805], and 4-6% in orthotopic sigmoid neobladders (Reddy) [802,806]. The risk of pouch stone formation is 4-43% in adults with an ileocaecal continent cutaneous urinary diversion (Indiana, modified Indiana, Kock, or Mainz I) [425,773,796,797,805,807]. The average interval from construction of the urinary diversion to stone detection is 71-99 months [801,808]. In children, the incidence of neobladder stone formation is 30% after Mainz II diversion (rectosigmoid reservoir) [779], and 27% after Kock ileal reservoir construction [791]. 6.4.5.4. Treatment of stones in patients with bladder augmentation or urinary diversion Stones may be removed by open or endoscopic surgery in patients with bladder augmentation or diversion [784]. However, often access cannot be obtained through a continent vesico-entero-cystostomy without damaging the continence apparatus; hence a percutaneous or open approach is typically preferred [784]. No studies comparing outcomes following procedures for stones in reconstructed or augmented bladders were found. Two observational studies indicate that percutaneous lithotomy can be safely performed with US or CT guidance in patients with reconstructed or augmented bladders [809,810] and is proposed to offer similar advantages over open surgery to those for percutaneous native bladder surgery. Stone recurrence after successful removal has been reported to be 10-42% [809,810], but appears to be unrelated to the modality used for stone removal [776,782,786,787,789,794]. Figure 6.1 Management of Bladder stones* Lithotripsy modality at surgeon’s discretion (e.g., mechanical, laser, pneumatic, ultrasonic).† Prefer “tubeless” procedure (without placing a catheter or drain) for children with primary bladder stones andno prior infection, surgery, or bladder dysfunction where open cystolithotomy is indicated.** Stone analysis should be sent for all first-time stone formers and in patients who develop a recurrence underpharmacological prevention, early recurrence after interventional therapy with complete stone clearance orlate recurrence after a prolonged stone-free period (see main Urolithiasis guideline).†† Use an alkaline citrate or sodium bicarbonate with frequent urine pH monitoring and dose titration to achieve a consistent pH > 6.5.
