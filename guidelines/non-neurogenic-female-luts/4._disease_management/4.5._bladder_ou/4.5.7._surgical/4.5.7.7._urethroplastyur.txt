4.5.7.7. Urethroplasty/urethral reconstruction. Surgical reconstruction of the female urethra has been used in the management of extensive urethral stricture. Several urethroplasty techniques include the use of vaginal or labial flaps, as well as vaginal and buccal grafts after cutting open the fibrotic tissue causing the urethral obstruction [571]. The use of bladder flaps has also been reported [572], and laboratory-engineered tissue grafts have also been used [572]. The surgical approaches have been described based on the position relative to the urethra; dorsal, ventral, or circumferential. The dorsal approach is believed to provide better mechanical support and a more vascularised bed for a graft or flap. However, there is greater risk of damage to the sphincter and clitoral bodies with this approach. The ventral approach is more familiar to most surgeons and requires less urethral mobilisation. However, it is reported as being more prone to urethrovaginal fistulae, although it is not clear to what extent [527]. Reviews of studies reporting outcomes of urethroplasty state success rates of 57–100% [573]. Pooled analysis from six studies using vaginal or labial flaps showed a mean success rate of 91% with a mean follow-up of 32 months. Vaginal or labial graft urethroplasty was reported to have an 80% success rate with a mean follow-up of 22 months. Oral mucosal grafts, reported in seven studies, had a mean success of 94% after a mean follow-up of fifteen months [527]. A later review of studies on dorsal buccal mucosal graft reported success rates of 62–100%, with a pooled success rate of 86% [574]. A long-term study with a mean follow-up of 32 months showed a stricture recurrence rate of 23.1% [573].
