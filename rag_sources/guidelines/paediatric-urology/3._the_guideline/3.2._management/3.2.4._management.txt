3.2.4. management. treatment started age six months. age, undescended testes rarely descend . kind treatment leading scrotally positioned testis finished twelve months, eighteen months latest, histological examination undescended testes age already revealed progressive loss germ cells leydig cells . early timing treatment also driven final adult results spermatogenesis hormone production, well risk tumour development . 3.2.4.1. medical therapy unfortunately, studies hormonal treatment poor quality, heterogeneous mixed patient populations, testis location, schedules dosages hormonal administration. additionally, long-term data almost completely lacking. short-term side effects hormonal treatment include increased scrotal erythema pigmentation, induction pubic hair penile growth. boys experience pain intramuscular injection human chorionic gonadotropin (hcg). tend regress treatment cessation . 3.2.4.1.1. medical therapy testicular descent hormonal therapy using hcg gonadotropin-releasing hormone (gnrh) based hormonal dependence testicular descent, limited success rate 20% . however, must taken account almost 20% descended testes risk re-ascending later . general, success rates depend testicular location. higher testis located prior therapy, lower success rate, suggesting testicular position important determinant success . authors recommend combined hcg-gnrh treatment. unfortunately, poorly documented treatment groups diverse. studies reported successful descent 38% non-responders monotherapy . panel consensus endocrine treatment achieve testicular descent recommended (le: 4). human chorionic gonadotropin human chorionic gonadotropin (hcg) stimulates endogenous testosterone production administered intramuscular injection. several dose administration schedules reported. proven difference 1.5 iu weight-based doses 3.0 iu every day fourteen days . similar response rates achieved 500 iu weekly 1.50 iu three times weekly . however, evidence dosing frequency might affect testicular descent rates. fewer lower dose injections per week five weeks seem superior one higher dose every seven ten days three weeks regard testicular descent . gonadotropin-releasing hormone gonadotropin-releasing hormone (gnrh) analogues (e.g., buserelin gonadorelin) available nasal sprays, thus avoiding painful intramuscular injections. typical dosage regimen consists 1.2 mg per day three divided doses, four weeks. success rates wide ranging, 9 60%, due multiple treatment strategies heterogeneous patient populations . 3.2.4.1.2. medical therapy fertility potential hormonal treatment may improve fertility indices therefore serve additional tool orchidopexy. difference treatment gnrh (neo-adjuvant) (adjuvant) surgical orchidolysis orchidopexy terms increasing fertility index, may predictor fertility later life . still unknown whether effect testicular histology persists adulthood shown men treated childhood buserelin better semen analyses compared men childhood orchidopexy alone placebo treatment . reported hcg treatment may harmful future spermatogenesis increased apoptosis germ cells, including acute inflammatory changes testes reduced testicular volume adulthood . identification specific subgroups boys undescended testes would benefit approach using hormones difficult. since important data specific groups well additional support long-term effects still lacking, nordic consensus recommend hormonal therapy . consensus panel recommend endocrine treatment gnrh analogues dosage described boys bilateral undescended testes preserve fertility potential (le: 4). 3.2.4.2. surgical therapy testis concluded descent age six months (corrected gestational age), since spontaneous testicular descent unlikely occur age, surgery performed within subsequent year, age eighteen months latest . addition, early orchidopexy followed partial catch-up testicular growth, case delayed surgery . findings recommend performing early orchidopexy ages six twelve months . despite early successful orchiopexy within first year life 25% boys non-syndromic undescended testes may risk infertility based hormonal histological data, published series 333 boys showed. especially true bilateral cases, addition 5% unilateral cases reduced numbers germ cells detected testicular biopsies well . 3.2.4.2.1. palpable testes surgery palpable testes includes orchidofunicolysis orchidopexy, either via inguinal scrotal approach. latter approach mainly reserved low-positioned, undescended testes, pros cons method weighed . 3.2.4.2.1.1. inguinal orchidopexy inguinal orchidopexy widely used technique high success rate 92% . important steps include mobilisation testis spermatic cord level internal inguinal ring, dissection division cremasteric fibres, prevent secondary retraction detachment gubernaculum testis. patent processus vaginalis needs ligated proximally level internal ring, unidentified inadequately repaired patent processus vaginalis important factor leading failure orchidopexy . additional pathology taken care of, removal appendix testis (hydatid morgagni). moment size testis measured connection epididimis testis judged described protocol. boys significant dissociation testis epididymis prognostically bad fertility. finally, mobilised testicle needs placed sub-dartos pouch within hemi-scrotum without tension. length achieved using above-mentioned technique still inadequate, prentiss manoeuvre, consists dividing inferior epigastric vessels transposing spermatic cord medially, order provide straight course scrotum, might option . regard fixation sutures, required, made tunica vaginalis dartos musculature . lymph drainage testis undergone surgery orchidopexy may changed high retroperitoneal drainage iliac inguinal drainage, might become important event later malignancy . 3.2.4.2.1.2. scrotal orchidopexy low-positioned, palpable undescended testis fixed scrotal incision including division gubernaculum, processus vaginalis needs probed check patency . otherwise, fixation scrotum carried correspondingly inguinal approach. 20% cases, inguinal incision compulsory correct associated inguinal hernia . testicular epididymal appendages easily identified removed. systematic review shows overall success rates ranged 88 100%, rates recurrence post-operative testicular atrophy hypotrophy < 1% . another systematic review meta-analysis revealed similar outcome data regarding post-operative complications, including wound infection, testicular atrophy, testicular reascent, hernia palpable low positioned undescended testes. significant difference shorter operative time . 3.2.4.2.2. non-palpable testes non-palpable testes, surgery must clearly determine whether testis present . testis found, decision made remove bring scrotum. important step surgery thorough re-examination boy general anaesthesia, since previously non-palpable testis might identifiable subsequently change surgical approach standard inguinal orchidopexy, described above. otherwise, easiest accurate way locate intra-abdominal testis diagnostic laparoscopy . subsequent removal orchidolysis orchidopexy carried using approach achieve therapeutic aims . tend start inguinal surgical exploration, possible laparoscopy procedure . ipsilateral scrotal nubbin suspected, contralateral compensatory testicular hypertrophy present, scrotal incision removal nubbin, thus confirming vanishing testis, option avoiding need laparoscopy . laparoscopy non-palpable testes, possible anatomical findings include spermatic vessels entering inguinal canal (40%), intra-abdominal (40%) peeping (10%) testis, blind-ending spermatic vessels confirming vanishing testis (10%) . vanishing testis, procedure finished blind-ending spermatic vessels clearly identified. vessels enter inguinal canal, atrophic testis may found upon inguinal exploration healthy testis needs undergo standard orchidopexy . peeping testis placed scrotum laparoscopically via inguinal incision . placement intra-abdominal testis sometimes surgical challenge. usually, testes lying > 2 cm internal inguinal ring may reach scrotum without division testicular vessels . circumstances, fowler-stephens orchidopexy may option (see figure 2). proximal cutting transection testicular vessels, conservation collateral arterial blood supply, via deferential artery cremasteric vessels comprise key features fowler-stephens procedure. modification low spermatic vessel ligation gained popularity, allowing blood supply testicular artery deferential artery. additional advantage position peritoneal incision, leading longer structure, ease later scrotal placement . due nature approaches testis risk hypotrophy atrophy collateral blood supply insufficient . testicular survival rate one-stage fowler-stephens technique varies 50 65% based post-operative doppler-ultrasound findings . two-stage procedures success rates increase 90% . advantages two-stage orchidopexy, second part done usually six months first, allow development collateral blood supply create greater testicular mobility . addition, preservation gubernaculum may also decrease chance testicular atrophy . alternative might microsurgical auto-transplantation, success rate 90%. however, approach requires skilled experienced surgeons performed limited number centres . 3.2.4.2.3. complications surgical therapy surgical complications usually uncommon, testicular atrophy serious. systematic review revealed overall atrophy rate primary orchidopexy 1.83%, 28.1% one-stage fowler-stephens procedure, 8.2% two-stage approach . rare complications comprise testicular ascent vas deferens injury besides local wound infection, dehiscence, haematoma. 3.2.4.2.4. surgical therapy undescended testes puberty study 51 men diagnosed inguinal unilateral undescended testis normal contralateral one, history previous therapy, demonstrated wide range changes upon histological evaluation. nearly half study population still significant germ cell activity different maturation levels. importantly, incidence intratubular germ cell neoplasia 2% . panel consensus recommends orchiectomy post-pubertal boys undescended testis normal contralateral one scrotal position. figure 2: treatment unilateral non-palpable undescended
