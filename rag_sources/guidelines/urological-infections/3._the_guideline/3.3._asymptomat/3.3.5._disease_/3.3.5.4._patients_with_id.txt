3.3.5.4. patients identified risk-factors. 3.3.5.4.1. diabetes mellitus diabetes mellitus, even well regulated, reported correlate higher frequency abu . one rct demonstrated eradicating abu reduce risk symptomatic uti infectious complications patients diabetes mellitus. time first symptomatic episode also similar groups. furthermore, untreated abu correlate diabetic nephropathy . screening treatment abu well-controlled diabetes mellitus therefore recommended. however, poorly regulated diabetes risk factor symptomatic uti infectious complications. 3.3.5.4.2. abu post-menopausal women elderly women increased incidence abu . four rcts compared antibiotic treatment abu placebo controls treatment, post-menopausal female population, different antibiotic doses regimens [70-73]. women studies mostly nursing home residents, may bias results analysis. three rcts reported rate symptomatic utis (average rr 0.71, 95% ci 0.49 1.05; 208 women) resolution bacteriuria (average rr 1.28, 95% ci 0.50 3.24; 203 women) , significant benefit antibiotic treatment. therefore, abu post-menopausal women require treatment, managed pre-menopausal women. 3.3.5.4.3. elderly institutionalised patients rate abu 15-50% elderly institutionalised patients . differential diagnosis abu symptomatic uti difficult multi-diseased mentally deteriorated patients, probably cause unnecessary antibiotic treatment . seven rcts compared antibiotic treatment abu placebo controls treatment elderly patients, different antibiotic doses regimens [70-73,77-79]. three rcts reported rate symptomatic utis . antibiotic treatment significantly beneficial reducing rate symptomatic utis compared placebo treatment (average rr 0.68, 95% ci 0.46 1.00; n=210). six rcts reported resolution bacteriuria [70,72,73,77-79]. benefit antibiotic treatment compared placebo resolution abu (average rr 1.33, 95% ci 0.63 2.79; n=328). one rct compared rates incontinence patient group eradication abu found effect antibiotic treatment . subsequent systematic review meta-analysis nine rcts found antibiotic treatment abu group associated significantly adverse effects clinical benefit . therefore, screening treatment abu recommended patient group. 3.3.5.4.4. patients renal transplants two rcts two retrospective studies compared effect antibiotic treatment treatment renal transplant patients [82-85]. meta-analysis two rcts find antibiotic treatment beneficial terms reducing symptomatic utis 12 22 months renal transplantation (rr 0.86, 95% ci 0.51 1.45; n=200). two retrospective studies reached conclusion. furthermore, significant differences rate abu clearance, graft loss change renal function long-term follow-up 24 months [82-85]. two rcts , one observational study two systematic reviews meta-analyses identified. first rct reported first 2 months following renal transplantation incidence risk utis (25% vs. 10%, hr 2.8, 95% ci 0.8-9.1, p=0.07) pyelonephritis (15% vs. 2.5%, hr 6.5, 95% ci 0.8-54.7, p=0.08) higher patients receiving antibiotic treatment abu vs. treatment . second rct difference acute graft pyelonephritis found treatment treatment group (12.2% vs 8.7%, rr 1.40, 95% ci 0.40-4.87) first year renal transplantation; however, rates antimicrobial resistance higher treatment group . first two additional meta-analyses reported results original study . second meta-analysis n=1,353 patients reported abu incidence rates 22% first month 32% first year renal transplantation . analysis find correlation abu acute graft pyelonephritis (or 1.8, 95% ci 0.78-1.79), benefit abu antibiotic treatment risk uti (or 1.08, 95% ci 0.63-1.84) change renal function (mean difference serum creatinine concentration - 0.03 mg/dl [95% ci 0.15-0.10]) . therefore, treatment abu recommended renal transplant recipients. 3.3.5.4.5. patients dysfunctional and/or reconstructed lower urinary tracts patients lower urinary tract dysfunction (lutd) (e.g., neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction (nlutd) secondary multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury patients, patients incomplete bladder emptying, patients using clean intermittent catheterisation [cic], patients reconstructed lower urinary tract including ileal conduits, orthotopic bladder replacement continent reservoirs frequently become colonised . systematic review reported abu prevalence rates ranging 25-86% intestinal conduits 4 studies 9.1-85% orthotopic neobladders 9 studies . studies shown long-term benefit abu treatment patient groups . furthermore, lutd patients spontaneously develop abu, deliberate colonisation abu strain (escherichia coli 83972) shown protective effect symptomatic recurrences . screening treatment abu patient groups therefore, recommended. patient groups develop recurrent symptomatic uti (see section 3.5) potential protective effect spontaneously developed abu uti must considered treatment. 3.3.5.4.6. patients catheters urinary tract patients indwelling suprapubic catheters nephrostomy tubes invariably become carriers abu, antibiotic treatment showing benefit . also applicable patients abu indwelling ureteral stents . routine treatment catheter-associated bacteriuria recommended. detailed recommendations see section 3.8. 3.3.5.4.7. patients abu subjected catheter placements/exchanges patients subjected uncomplicated placement/exchanges indwelling urethral catheters abu considered risk factor screened treated . patients subjected placement/exchanges nephrostomy tubes indwelling ureteral stents, abu considered risk factor infectious complications . 3.3.5.4.8. immuno-compromised severely diseased patients, patients candiduria patient groups considered individually benefit screening treatment abu reviewed case. patients asymptomatic candiduria may, although necessarily, underlying disorder defect. treatment asymptomatic candiduria recommended .
