6.2.1.2.3. Magnetic resonance imaging for selection for active surveillance. In men eligible for AS based upon systematic biopsy findings alone who did not have a pre-biopsy MRI, a re-biopsy within six to twelve months months (usually referred to as ‘confirmatory biopsy’) seems mandatory to exclude sampling error. A large body of literature including two RCTs and a SR, showed that adding MRI-targeted biopsy to systematic sampling at confirmatory biopsy improved detection of ISUP grade group ≥ 2 cancers and thus, patient selection for AS [121,499-504]. Adding MRI-targeted biopsy to systematic sampling at confirmatory biopsy improved upgrade detection by increments of 0-7.9 per 100 men depending on the series [499]. In a meta-analysis of 6 studies, the rate of upgrading to ISUP grade group ≥ 2 cancer increased from 20% (95% CI: 16–25%) to 27% (95% CI: 22–34%) when MRI-targeted biopsy was added to systematic biopsy [504]. The Active Surveillance MRI Study (ASIST) randomised men on AS scheduled for confirmatory biopsy to either 12-core systematic biopsy or to MRI with targeted biopsy (when indicated), combined with systematic biopsy (up to 12 cores in total). After two years of follow-up, use of MRI before confirmatory biopsy resulted in fewer failures of surveillance (19% vs. 35%, p = 0.017) and in fewer patients progressing to ISUP grade group ≥ 2 cancer (9.9% vs. 23%, p = 0.048) [502]. However, systematic biopsy retains its additional value, which argues for a combined biopsy approach [499,504]. The DETECTIVE study agreed that men eligible for AS after combined systematic- and MRI-targeted biopsy do not require a confirmatory biopsy, a recommendation further supported by the results of the MRIAS trial [330,505]. If the PCa diagnosis is made on MRI-targeted biopsy alone in order to lower the risk of over-detection of insignificant (see 5.4.1 and 5.4.2.), a confirmative systematic biopsy should be performed before definite decision of AS to rule out more widespread cancer growth in the prostate [186,189,190]. A few studies indicate that PSMA-PET-CT or PSMA-PET-MRI may have additional value to above mentioned clinico-pathological variables for risk stratification before AS [122,506]. However, so far, the studies are too small and the follow-up too short to draw any hard conclusions and for this modality to be recommended outside clinical trials.
