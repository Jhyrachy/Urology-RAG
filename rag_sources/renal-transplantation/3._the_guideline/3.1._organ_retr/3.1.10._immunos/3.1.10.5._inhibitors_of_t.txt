effective mpa combined cnis preventing rejection [243,246,279,306-309]. however, m-tor inhibitors exhibit dose-dependent bone marrow toxicity [243,279,306-308]. potential side effects include hyperlipidaemia, oedema, development lymphoceles, wound-healing problems, pneumonitis, proteinuria, impaired fertility. extensive side effect profile responsible inferior tolerability compared mpa potential differences outcome early years, higher doses used [310-315]. date, prospective comparative studies carried m-tor inhibitors sirolimus everolimus . m-tor inhibitors almost identical side effect profile mainly differ pharmacokinetic properties [243,279,306-308,317]. sirolimus half-life 60 hours, given day licensed prophylaxis kidney recipients only. everolimus half-life 24 hours, licensed kidney, liver heart recipients given twice day. everolimus licenced use cyclosporine given simultaneously cyclosporine, sirolimus given four hours cyclosporine. pharmacological drug-drug interaction cyclosporine far less relevant tacrolimus, resulting need higher starting dose m-tor inhibitors combination tacrolimus . sirolimus also licensed combination therapy steroids cyclosporine withdrawal combination therapy cyclosporine. therapeutic monitoring trough levels recommended narrow therapeutic window risk drug-to-drug interactions [243,279,306-308,317]. combined cnis, antimicrobial prophylaxis pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia administered one year following transplantation, e.g. low-dose cotrimoxazole [243,306-308]. importantly, combination therapy cnis aggravates cni-induced nephrotoxicity, although m-tor inhibitors non-nephrotoxic . several studies suggest less favourable outcomes increased drug discontinuations due adverse events combination, especially cnis maintained standard dosages [243,246,248,260,309,311,312,320-325]. calcineurin inhibitor dosage therefore substantially reduced combination therapy m-tor inhibitors, seems impact efficacy, due highly synergistic potential combination therapy [279,306-308,314,317]. several studies suggest m-tor inhibitors cannot replace cnis initial phase transplantation due lower efficacy less favourable side effect profile, particularly wound healing problems lymphoceles . trials suggest m-tor inhibitors may replace cni later stages, e.g. three months transplantation, improvements renal function, predominately cyclosporine treated patients [243,245,246,248,258,279,306-308,311,312,314,326-328]. unclear real benefit comparison patients tacrolimus mpa . however, increased risk rejection

infections compared mpa [260,311,314,324-326,330]. proteinuria poor renal function conversion associated inferior outcomes [243,245,279,306-308]. conversion cnis advisable patients proteinuria > 800

patients kaposi sarcoma cni therapy benefit conversion m-tor inhibitor . summary, m-tor inhibitors recommended initial immunosuppressive therapy due side effect profile higher discontinuation rates . however, m-tor inhibitors well-studied alternative treatment option. summary evidencelecombination therapy cnis aggravates cni-induced nephrotoxicity. therefore, cni dosage substantially reduced
