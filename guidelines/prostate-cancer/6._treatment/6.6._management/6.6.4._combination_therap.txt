6.6.4. Combination therapies. All of the following combination therapies have been studied with continuous ADT, not intermittent ADT. 6.6.4.1.‘Combined’ androgen blockade with older generation NSAA (bicalutamide, flutamide, nilutamide) Systematic reviews have shown that CAB using a NSAA appears to provide a small survival advantage (< 5%) vs. monotherapy (surgical castration or LHRH agonists) [1110,1111] but this minimal survival advantage must be balanced against the increased side effects. In addition, the newer combination therapies (see Tables 6.4.3, 6.4.4, 6.4.5) are more effective as shown specifically for enzalutamide which was tested against NSAA in a phase III trial [1112]. More recently another trial has demonstrated a significant OS benefit for the addition of rezvilutamide vs. addition of bicalutamide to ADT in patients with high-volume mHSPC [1113]. Therefore combination with NSAAs should only be considered if other combination therapies are not available. 6.6.4.2. Androgen deprivation combined with other agents 6.6.4.2.1. Androgen deprivation therapy combined with chemotherapy Three large RCTs were conducted [775,1088,1114]. All trials compared ADT alone as the SOC with ADT combined with immediate docetaxel (75 mg/sqm, every three weeks within three months of ADT initiation). The primary objective in all three studies was to assess OS. The key findings are summarised in Table 6.4.3.

In the GETUG 15 trial, all patients had M1 PCa, either de novo or after a primary treatment [1114]. They were stratified based on previous treatment and Glass risk factors [1085]. In the CHAARTED trial the same inclusion criteria applied, and patients were stratified according to disease volume (see Table 6.4.1) [1088]. STAMPEDE is a multi-arm multi-stage trial in which the reference arm (ADT monotherapy) included 1,184 patients. One of the experimental arms was docetaxel combined with ADT (n = 593), another was docetaxel combined with zoledronic acid (n = 593). Patients were included with either M1 or N1 or having two of the following three criteria: T3/4, PSA ≥ 40 ng/mL or ISUP grade group 4–5. Also relapsed patients after local treatment were included if they met one of the following criteria: PSA ≥ 4 ng/mL with a PSA-DT < six months or a PSA ≥ 20 ng/mL, N1 or M1. No stratification was used regarding metastatic disease volume (high/low volume) [775]. In all three trials toxicity was mainly haematological with around 12–15% grade 3–4 neutropenia, and 6–12% grade 3–4 febrile neutropenia. The use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor (GCSF) was shown to be beneficial in reducing febrile neutropenia. Primary or secondary prophylaxis with GCSF should be based on available guidelines [1116,1117]. Docetaxel in all three trials was used at the standard dose of 75 mg/sqm every three weeks, six cycles in CHAARTED and STAMPEDE and up to nine cycles in GETUG-AFU-15. In subgroup analyses from GETUG-AFU 15 and CHAARTED the beneficial effect of the addition of docetaxel to ADT was most evident in men with de novo metastatic high-volume disease [1089,1090], while it was in the same range whatever the volume in the post-hoc analysis from STAMPEDE [1115]. The effect of adding docetaxel was less apparent in men who had prior local radical treatment although the numbers were small and the event rates lower. A SR and meta-analysis which included these three trials showed that the addition of docetaxel to SOC improved survival [1117]. The HR of 0.77 (95% CI: 0.68–0.87, p < 0.0001) translates into an absolute improvement in 4-year survival of 9% (95% CI: 5–14). In a SR and meta-analysis of individual participant data from the the three trials it has been shown that there is no meaningful beneficial effect of addition of docetaxel to ADT for patients with metachronous low volume disease. Interestingly the largest absolute improvement at five years was observed for the patients with high volume and clinical stage four disease [1118]. Based on these data, upfront docetaxel combined with ADT was considered as a standard in men presenting with metastases at first presentation, provided they are fit enough to receive docetaxel [1117]. More recently two large Phase III studies have now shown an OS benefit by adding an ARPI to ADT and docetaxel. Therefore adding docetaxel alone to ADT should only be considered if no ARPI is available or all available ones are contraindicated (see Section 6.4.4.2.3). 6.6.4.2.2. Combination with an ARPI alone (abiraterone, apalutamide, enzalutamide) In two large RCTs (STAMPEDE, LATITUDE) the addition of abiraterone acetate (1000 mg daily) plus prednisone (5 mg daily) to ADT in men with mHSPC was studied [814,1070,1119] (see table 6.4.4). The primary objective of both trials was an improvement in OS. Both trials showed a significant OS benefit. In LATITUDE with only de novo high-risk metastatic patients included, the HR reached 0.62 (0.51–0.76) [1070]. The HR in STAMPEDE was very similar with 0.63 (0.52–0.76) in the total patient population (metastatic and non-metastatic) and a HR of 0.61 in the subgroup of metastatic patients [814]. While only high-risk patients were included in the LATITUDE trial a post-hoc analysis from STAMPEDE showed the same benefit whatever the risk or the volume category was [1120]. All secondary objectives such as PFS, time to radiographic progression, time to pain, or time to chemotherapy were in favour of the combination. No difference in treatment-related deaths was observed with the combination of ADT plus AAP compared to ADT monotherapy (HR: 1.37 [0.82–2.29]). However, twice as many patients discontinued treatment due to toxicity in the combination arms in STAMPEDE (20%) compared to LATITUDE (12%) [1119]. Based on these data upfront AAP combined with ADT should be considered as a standard in men presenting with metastases at first presentation, provided they are fit enough to receive the drug. In three large RCTs (TITAN, ARCHES and ENZAMET) the addition of AR antagonists to ADT in men with mHSPC was tested [1068,1069,1112]. In ARCHES the primary endpoint was radiographic PFS (rPFS). In the primary analysis rPFS was significantly improved for the combination of enzalutamide and ADT with a HR of 0.39 (0.3–0.5). Approximately 36% of the patients had low-volume disease; around 25% had prior local therapy and 18% of the patients had received prior docetaxel. In the final prespecified analysis the key secondary enpoint OS was significantly improved with a HR of 0.66 (0.53-0.81) and a significant benefit for rPFS was maintained with a HR of 0.63 (0,52–0.76) [1121]. In ENZAMET the primary endpoint was OS. The addition of enzalutamide to ADT in the first analysis improved OS with a HR of 0.67 (0.52–0.86) compared to ADT plus a non-steroidal antiandrogen. Approximately half of the patients had concomitant docetaxel; about 40% had prior local therapy and about half of the patients had low-volume disease [1069]. In a planned later analysis with a median follow-up of 68 months the OS benefit of adding enzalutamide was maintained with a HR of 0.7 (0.58-0.84) [1122] In the TITAN trial, ADT plus apalutamide was used and rPFS and OS were co-primary endpoints. In the primary analysis rPFS was significantly improved by the addition of apalutamide with a HR of 0.48 (0.39–0.6); OS at 24 months was improved for the combination with a HR of 0.67 (0.51–0.89). In the final analysis the HR for OS was 0.65 (0.53–0.79) without adjustment for cross-over. In this trial 16% of patients had prior local therapy, 37% had low-volume disease and 11% received prior docetaxel [1068,1123]. In the more recently published CHART trial, ADT plus rezvilutamide was tested vs. ADT plus bicalutamide in patients with high-volume de novo metastatic disease. Ninety percent of the patients were recruited in China. Overall survival and rPFS were co-primary endpoints. At the pre-planned interim analysis rezvilutamide significantly improved rPFS compared with bicalutamide with a HR of 0.44 (0.33–0.58) and OS with a HR of 0.58 (0.44–0.77) [1113]. In summary, the addition of the new AR antagonists significantly improves clinical outcomes with no convincing evidence of differences between subgroups. The majority of patients had de novo metastatic disease and the evidence is most compelling in this situation. In the trials with the new AR antagonists, a proportion of patients had metachronous disease (see Table 6.4.5); in the subgroup analyses the effect seemed to be consistent and therefore, a combination should also be offered for men progressing after radical local therapy [1122,1124,1125].

Combination with docetaxel and an ARPI The addition of abiraterone to ADT and docetaxel has been reported to have a benefit in rPFS and in OS in the PEACE-1 trial [1126,1127]. The trial has a 2x2 factorial design and participants with de novo (synchronous) metastatic PCa were randomised to SOC; at the beginning of the trial ADT, later ADT plus docetaxel for 6 cycles if chemotherapy-fit) vs. SOC plus radiotherapy vs. SOC plus abiraterone vs. SOC plus radiotherapy plus abiraterone. Co-primary endpoints were rPFS and OS, both were statistically significantly improved in the total population. Also in the group of patients who received ADT plus docetaxel as SOC (n = 710) both rPFS and OS were increased with a HR: 0.5 (0.34–0.71) and 0.75 (0.59–0.95), respectively. Of note; in this population about 35% had low-volume disease. Toxicity was modestly increased, mostly hypertension. In the ARASENS Phase III trial all patients received ADT and docetaxel for 6 cycles as SOC plus darolutamide or placebo [1128]. 1,306 metastatic patients were included, 14 % of them with relapsed disease after radical local treatment (metachronous). Primary endpoint was OS and this was statistically significanty increased by the addition of darolutamide with a HR of 0.68 (0.57–0.8). Interestingly, in this trial the occurrence of AEs was similar in both arms. In both trials docetaxel and the ARPI have been given concomitantly. Of the included patients 77% had high volume and 70% high-risk disease. In an unplanned subgroup analysis the beneficial effect of adding darolutamide versus placebo for OS was seen in the patients with high-volume (HR 0.69; 0.57-0.82), with high-risk (HR 0.71; 0.58-0.86) and in low-risk disease (HR 0.62; 0.42-0.9), for the small subgroup of patients with low-volume disease the results were suggestive of an OS benefit (HR 0.68; 0.41-1.13) [1129] Also in ENZAMET, TITAN and ARCHES there were patients who received docetaxel as a part of SOC, thus not all concomitantly, but the percentage of patients receiving docetaxel in these trials was much lower [1068,1069,1112]. There are also SRs and network meta-analysis for systemic triplet therapies and they confirm that the triplets are more effective than ADT and docetaxel alone [1130], in one analysis looking into subgroups statistically significant for patients with high volume disease and de novo disease [1131].
