3.4.3. Surgical treatment. There is considerable heterogeneity in outcome parameters and definitions of cure used to report on outcomes of surgical interventions for SUI in neuro-urological patients [297]. The heterogeneity of outcome reporting makes it difficult to interpret and compare different studies and therapies. A consistent comparison of the outcomes of therapy can only be made after standardisation of outcome parameters and definitions of cure or success; therefore, it would seem prudent to develop a core outcome set (COS) for use in UI research in neuro-urological patients [297]. Until such a COS is developed it would seem feasible to use both a subjective and objective outcome parameter and the combination of both to define cure [297]. Due to the importance of QoL for neuro-urological patients a disease-specific QoL questionnaire or a validated bother questionnaire validated for neuro-urological patients should be used as the subjective outcome parameter [297]. 3.4.3.1. Bladder neck and urethral procedures to improve neurogenic stress urinary incontinence Procedures to treat neurogenic stress urinary incontinence (N-SUI) are suitable only when the risk for upper urinary tract deterioration and detrusor pressures can be controlled. A simultaneous therapy of bladder management may be necessary [298]. Urethral sling: Various materials have been used for this procedure with enduring positive results. The procedure is established in women with the ability to self-catheterise [298-303]. There is growing evidence that female synthetic mid-urethral slings (MUS) can be used effectively with acceptable medium to long-term results and minimal morbidity in neuro-urological patients [300,301]. Autologous pubovaginal sling has been considered the procedure of choice for treating female N-SUI and it should be preferred when concomitant bladder augmentation is also indicated [300]. Compared to transobturator, the retropubic route has been suggested to be more effective in women with N-SUI [301]. However, either for both synthetic MUS as well as autologous sling additional bladder management may become necessary due to the risk of “de novo” LUTS [300-302]. Complications include the need to perform IC especially after retropubic approach, mesh erosion or extrusion requiring partial or total removal, and retropubic haematoma and the 5-year failure rate is relevant [300,301]. In men, both autologous and synthetic slings have been investigated less frequently compared to women and mainly in patients already on IC regimen before surgery [300]. The cure rate ranged from 29% to 71% at a follow-up of 12 to 36 months. Complications included haematoma, tape infection or erosion into urethra and difficulty to perform IC [300].Artificial urinary sphincter (AUS): This device was introduced by Light and Scott for male patients with N-SUI [304]. It has stood the test of time and acceptable long-term outcomes can be obtained [305]. Implantation of AUS is the most often performed procedure for N-SUI especially in men with a high success/improvement rate [300]. However, the complication and re-operation rates are higher than in non-neurogenic SUI (up to 60%), so it is advisable that patients are conscientiously informed about the success rates as well as the possible need for re-intervention [306,307]. In a case series with 25 years follow-up only 7.1% of patients were revision free at twenty years [308]. Re-interventions are commonly due to mechanical failure, urethral atrophy or erosion and infection. There is growing interest in the use of this device with development of laparoscopic and robot-assisted approaches via an anterior or a posterior access to the bladder neck [309,310]. Nonetheless, careful patient selection and appropriate preoperative investigation are crucial [310]. Although from a single institution series, long-term surgical results are now available and support the potentially prominent role of AUS placement in female patients with N-SUI [300,311-313]. Long-term surgical and patient-reported outcomes are needed to determine the role of AUS placement in female patients with N-SUI [311].Adjustable continence device – (inflatable balloons): The efficacy of this device has been reported mainly in post-prostatectomy incontinence (non-neurogenic male lower urinary tract symptoms EAU guidelines – Section 5.6.5.3.2). A similar cure and improvement rate has been reported in neurological patients when compared to non-neurological patients [314,315]. However, it is associated with a low safety profile due to the high complication and limited device survival rate [316].Bladder neck and urethra reconstruction: The classical Young-Dees-Leadbetter procedure [317] for bladder neck reconstruction in children with bladder exstrophy, and Kropp urethra lengthening [318] improved by Salle [319], are established methods to restore continence provided that IC is practiced and/or bladder augmentation is performed [134,320]. Endoscopic techniques for treating anatomic bladder outlet obstruction :321 Transurethral resection of the prostate is indicated in male patients with refractory LUT symptoms due to benign prostatic obstruction. Special consideration should be given to pre-operative abnormal sphincter function and the type of neurological disease, which can lead to persistent or “de novo” LUTS [322,323].Urethrotomy is indicated in patients with urethral strictures. Cold knife or neodymium:YAG contact laser urethrotomy at the twelve o’clock position can be performed [324,325].Urethroplasty should be performed on an individual basis depending on the urethral lesion (erosion, stricture, diverticula, fistula), length and location. However urethral surgery in neurological patients has a high failure rate and in recurrent strictures, urinary diversion should be considered [326].Sphincterotomy has been shown to be an efficient technique for the resolution of AD, hydronephrosis and recurrent UTI, and for decreasing detrusor pressure, PVR and vesicoureteral reflux. It is irreversible and should be limited to men who are able to wear a condom catheter. By staged incision, bladder outlet resistance can be reduced without completely losing the closure function of the urethra [133,134,327]. The incision with less complications, is the twelve o’clock sphincterotomy with cold knife [328] or neodymium:YAG laser [329]. Sphincterotomy needs to be repeated at regular intervals in many patients [330], but it is efficient and does not cause severe adverse effects [133,331]. Secondary narrowing of the bladder neck may occur, for which combined bladder neck incision might be considered [332].Bladder neck incision: This may be indicated for anatomical or functional bladder neck obstruction [290,293,321,323].Stents: Implantation of urethral stents results in continence being dependent on adequate closure of the bladder neck [134]. The results are comparable with sphincterotomy and the stenting procedure has a shorter duration of surgery and hospital stay [333,334]. However, the costs [133], possible complications and re-interventions [335,336] are limiting factors in their use [337-340]. 3.4.3.2. Denervation, deafferentation, sacral neuromodulation Sacral anterior root stimulation (SARS) is aimed at producing detrusor contraction. The technique was developed by Brindley [341] and is only applicable to complete lesions above the implant location, as its stimulation amplitude is over the pain threshold. The urethral sphincter efferents are also stimulated, but because the striated muscle relaxes faster than the smooth muscle of the detrusor, so-called “post-stimulus voiding” occurs. This approach has been successful in highly selected patients [342-345]. Although it has been shown that detrusor pressure during SARS decreases over time, the changes do not seem to be clinically relevant during the first decade after surgery [346]. By changing the stimulation parameters, this method can also induce defecation or erection. A recent study reported that Charcot spinal arthropathy should be considered as a potential long-term complication of SARS, leading to spinal instability and to SARS dysfunction [347]. Sacral rhizotomy, also known as sacral deafferentation, has achieved some success in reducing NDO [348-350], but nowadays, it is used mostly as an adjuvant to SARS [342,351-354]. Alternatives to rhizotomy are sought in this treatment combination [355-357]. There is growing evidence, including one RCT [358], on the use of sacral neuromodulation for treating neuro-urological symptoms, but due to the paucity of disease specific studies it remains unclear which neurological patients are most suitable [359-361]. MS patients with NDO have been often reported as good responders to several types of neuromodulations [361-363]. The neuromodulation effect on urodynamic parameters is still unclear [364]. With the development of MRI-compatible pulse generators and leads, the avoidance of this procedure in patients needing this imaging technique for their follow-up is no longer required. Other neuromodulation techniques like the deep brain stimulation in PD patients may have beneficial effects in the LUT but these depend on the site of stimulation and although prospective, specifically designed studies are needed in neuro-urological patients [365,366]. 3.4.3.3. Bladder covering by striated muscle When the bladder is covered by striated muscle, that can be stimulated electrically, or ideally that can be contracted voluntarily, voiding function can be restored to an acontractile bladder. The rectus abdominis [367] and latissimus dorsi [368] have been used successfully in neuro-urological patients [369,370]. 3.4.3.4. Bladder augmentation The aim of auto-augmentation (detrusor myectomy) is to reduce NDO or improve bladder compliance. The advantages are low surgical burden, low rate of long-term adverse effects, positive effect on patient QoL, and it does not preclude further interventions [133,298,371-374]. Replacing or expanding the bladder by intestine ensures a low-pressure reservoir improving bladder compliance and abolishing or at least reducing NDO [375,376]. Improved QoL and stable renal function has been reported during long-term follow-up in SCI and SB patients [377-379]. It is not clear whether augmented cystoplasty should be combined with simultaneous ureter reimplantation when high grade VUR is present [379,380]. Patients performing IC with augmented cystoplasty had better urinary function and satisfaction with their urinary symptoms compared to patients performing IC with or without botulinum toxin treatment [381]. Long-term complications includes bladder perforation (1.9%), mucus production (12.5%), metabolic abnormalities (3.35%), bowel dysfunction (15%), and stone formation (10%) [377]. The procedure should be used with caution in neuro-urological patients but may become necessary if all less-invasive treatment methods have failed. Special attention should be paid to patients with pre-operative renal scars since metabolic acidosis can develop [382]. Supratrigonal cystectomy [376,383], is indicated in patients with a severely thick and fibrotic bladder wall. Intermittent catheterisation may become necessary after this procedure. The long-term scientific evidence shows that bladder augmentation is a highly successful procedure that stabilises renal function and prevents anatomical deterioration; however, lifelong follow-up is essential in this patient group given the significant morbidity associated with this procedure [377,384,385]. 3.4.3.5. Urinary diversion When no other therapy is successful, urinary diversion must be considered for the protection of the UUT [298]. Continent diversion: This should be the first choice for urinary diversion. Patients with limited dexterity or anatomical barriers (e.g., urethral strictures, women with poor mobility and/or obesity) may prefer a stoma instead of using the urethra for catheterisation. For cosmetic reasons, the umbilicus is often used for the stoma site [386-392]. A SR of the literature concluded that continent catheterisable tubes/stomas are an effective treatment option in neuro-urological patients unable to perform intermittent self-catheterisation through the urethra [393]. The positive impact on QoL comprised sexual life improvement, better body image, high satisfaction rates in urologic management, independence, time saved on catheterisation, and better capacity to perform daily activity and work [394]. However, the complication rates were significant with 85/213 post-operative events requiring re-operation [393]. Tube stenosis occurred in 4-32% of the cases. Complications related to concomitant procedures (augmentation cystoplasty, pouch) included neovesicocutaneous fistulae (3.4%), bladder stones (20-25%), and bladder perforations (up to 40% in one case series) [393]. Incontinent diversion: If catheterisation is impossible, incontinent diversion with a urine-collecting device is indicated. Ultimately, it could be considered in selected patients with intractable and untreatable incontinence, in patients with LUT destruction, when the UUT is severely compromised, and in patients who refuse other therapy [134]. An ileal segment is used for the diversion in most cases [134,395-398]. Patients gain better functional status and QoL after surgery [399]. Moreover, to achieve a high satisfaction rate, it is necessary to involve relatives and caregivers with stoma management. Concomitant cystectomy to avoid pyocystitis may be advisable [400]. All procedures can be done open, laparoscopically as well as robotically [401-403]. However, prospective comparative studies are lacking [402,404]. Undiversion: Long-standing diversions may be successfully undiverted or an incontinent diversion changed to a continent one with the emergence of new and better techniques for control of detrusor pressure and incontinence [134]. The patient must be carefully counselled and must comply meticulously with the instructions [134]. Successful undiversion can then be performed [405]. In a prospective observational study (n=1,479), QoL was investigated in neuro-urological patients using four different bladder management options. It is the first study to focus on PROMS and noted that surgery was associated with fewer bladder management difficulties and a better QoL [61]. 3.4.3.6. Summary of evidence and recommendations for surgical treatment Summary of evidenceLEBladder augmentation is an effective option to decrease detrusor pressure and increase bladder capacity, when all less-invasive treatment methods have failed.3Urethral sling placement is an established procedure, with acceptable mid- to long-term results, in women with the ability to self-catheterise.3Artificial urinary sphincter insertion is the most frequently offered option to treat neurogenic SUI with acceptable long-term outcomes, in males.
