4.1.4.2.3.2. Anticholinergic burden. Several drugs have anticholinergic effects and, if another anticholinergic drug is prescribed, possible cumulative effects on cognition should be considered. Lists of drugs with anticholinergic properties are available from several sources [229]. Two SRs of largely retrospective cohort studies showed a consistent association between long-term anticholinergic use and cognitive dysfunction [230,231]. Longitudinal studies in older people over two to four years have found increased rates of cognitive decline in patients on anticholinergics or drugs with anticholinergic effects [199,200,232,233]. It is unclear whether there is a direct correlation between cognitive dysfunction caused by medication and the long-term risk of development of dementia.
