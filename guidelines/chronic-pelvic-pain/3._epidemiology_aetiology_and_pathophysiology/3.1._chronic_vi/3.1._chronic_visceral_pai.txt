3.1. Chronic visceral pain. Definition of pain Pain is defined as an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with, or resembling that associated with, actual or potential tissue damage (IASP Taxonomy) [20]. Introduction to chronic pelvic primary pain syndromes Over the years much of the focus for chronic pelvic primary pain syndromes (CPPPSs) has been on peripheral-end-organ mechanisms, such as inflammatory or infective conditions. However, both animal and clinical research have indicated that many of the mechanisms for the CPPPSs are based within the CNS. Although a peripheral stimulus such as infection may initiate the start of a CPPPS condition, the condition may become self-perpetuating as a result of CNS modulation. As well as pain, these central mechanisms are associated with several other sensory, functional, behavioural and psychological phenomena. It is this collection of phenomena that form the basis of the pain syndrome diagnosis and each individual phenomenon needs to be addressed in its own right through multispecialty and multi-disciplinary care. Although ongoing peripheral organ pathology can produce persistent and chronic pain, the main focus of these guidelines is on CPPPSs in which no peripheral ongoing pathology (such as infection or neoplastic disease) is detected. The main exception is when pain is due to peripheral nerve damage.
