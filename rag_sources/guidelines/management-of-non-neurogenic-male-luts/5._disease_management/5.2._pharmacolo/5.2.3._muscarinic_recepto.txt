5.2.3. muscarinic receptor antagonists. mechanism action: detrusor innervated parasympathetic nerves whose main neurotransmitter acetylcholine, stimulates muscarinic receptors (m-cholinoreceptors) smooth muscle cells. muscarinic receptors also present cell types, bladder urothelial cells epithelial cells salivary glands. five muscarinic receptor subtypes (m1-m5) described, m2 m3 predominant detrusor. m2 subtype numerous, m3 subtype functionally important bladder contractions . antimuscarinic effects might also induced modulated cell types, bladder urothelium central nervous system . following muscarinic receptor antagonists licensed treating oab/storage symptoms: darifenacin hydrobromide (darifenacin); fesoterodine fumarate (fesoterodine); oxybutynin hydrochloride (oxybutynin); propiverine hydrochloride (propiverine); solifenacin succinate (solifenacin); tolterodine tartrate (tolterodine); trospium chloride. transdermal preparations oxybutynin formulated evaluated clinical trials . efficacy: antimuscarinics mainly tested females past, believed luts men caused prostate, treated prostate-specific drugs. however, scientific data assumption . sub-analysis open-label trial oab patients showed age, gender impact urgency, frequency, urgency incontinence . pooled analysis, included sub-analysis male patients, fesoterodine 8 mg superior tolterodine extended release (er) 4 mg improvement severe urgency episodes/24 hours oab-q symptom bother score week twelve, urinary retention rate around 2% . efficacy antimuscarinics single agents men oab absence boo tested [216-221]. trials lasted twelve weeks. four post hoc analyses large rcts treatment oab women men without presumed boo performed focusing men . tolterodine significantly reduce urgency incontinence, daytime 24-hour frequency urgency-related voiding whilst improving patient perception treatment benefit . solifenacin significantly improved mean patient perception bladder condition scores, mean oab questionnaire scores, overall perception bladder problems. fesoterodine improved micturition frequency, urgency episodes, uui episodes. open-label trials tolterodine, daytime frequency, nocturia, uui, ipss significantly reduced compared baseline values twelve 25 weeks . times rct reported tolterodine er monotherapy significantly improved uui episodes per 24 hours compared placebo, week twelve. tolterodine er significantly improve urgency, ipss total qol score compared placebo . analysis showed men psa levels < 1.3 ng/ml (smaller prostates) might benefit antimuscarinics . two studies found positive effect antimuscarinics patients oab concomitant bpo . small rct propiverine improved frequency urgency episodes . tolerability safety: antimuscarinic drug trials generally show approximately 3-10% withdrawals, similar placebo. drug-related adverse events include dry mouth (up 16%), constipation (up 4%), micturition difficulties (up 2%), nasopharyngitis (up 3%), dizziness (up 5%). increased pvr men without boo minimal similar placebo. nevertheless, fesoterodine 8 mg showed higher pvrs (+20.2 ml) placebo (-0.6 ml) fesoterodine 4 mg (+9.6 ml) . incidence urinary retention men without boo similar placebo tolterodine (0-1.3% vs. 0-1.4%). fesoterodine 8 mg, 5.3% symptoms, higher placebo fesoterodine 4 mg (both 0.8%). symptoms appeared first two weeks treatment mainly affected men aged 66 years older. theoretically antimuscarinics might decrease bladder strength, hence might associated pvr urinary retention. twelve week safety study men mild-to-moderate boo showed tolterodine increased pvr (49 ml vs. 16 ml) aur (3% arms) . urodynamic effects included larger bladder volumes first detrusor contraction, higher maximum cystometric capacity, decreased bladder contractility index, qmax unchanged. trial indicated short-term treatment antimuscarinics men boo safe . practical considerations: antimuscarinics tested elderly men, long-term studies efficacy muscarinic receptor antagonists men age luts yet available. addition, patients low pvr volumes baseline included studies. drugs therefore prescribed caution, regular re-evaluation symptom scores pvr advised. men advised discontinue medication worsening voiding luts urinary stream noted initiation therapy. summary evidenceleantimuscarinic monotherapy significantly improve urgency, uui, increased daytime frequency.2antimuscarinic monotherapy associated increased pvr therapy, acute retention rare event men pvr volume < 150 ml baseline.2 recommendationsstrength ratinguse muscarinic receptor antagonists men moderate-to-severe luts mainly bladder storage symptoms.strongdo use antimuscarinic overactive bladder medications men post-void residual volume > 150 ml.weak
