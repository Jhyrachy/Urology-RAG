3.2. epidemiology. penile cancer incidence varies across world (fig. 3.1). industrialised countries, penile cancer uncommon, overall incidence around 0.94/100,000 males europe 0.5 usa . contrast, south america, southeast asia parts africa, incidence much higher account 1–2% malignant disease men . annual age-adjusted incidence 0.7–3.0 india, 8.3 brazil (per 100,000, respectively) higher parts africa uganda . europe, considerable variation across countries. data norway showed increase age-standardised incidence rates 5-year periods 2001-2015 compared previous periods (0.65/100,000 1956–60 vs. 0.91/100,000, 2011-2015) estimated annual percent change +0.80% . united kingdom, age-standardised incidence rate increased 28% 1993 2018. trend seen age groups 50–79 years old. incidence rates remained unchanged age extremes (< 50 > 79 years) . based 16 cancer registries france, incidence rates 2009 2011 0.59 per 100,000 men (95% ci: 0.50–0.68) rates remained stable since 1989 . usa, incidence penile cancer affected race ethnicity, highest incidence white hispanics (1.01), followed alaskans native american indians (0.77), african americans (0.62) white non-hispanics (0.51), per 100,000 males, respectively. overall age-adjusted incidence rate decreased 1973 2002; per decade 0.84 (1973–1982), 0.69 (1983–1992), 0.58 (1993–2002) per 100,000 males, respectively . increasing trend, slightly surpassing previous incidence rates, described using surveillance, epidemiology end result (seer) 2000–2016 data , showing estimated annual percent change +3.5% 2004-2016 . incidence increases age , peak sixth decade occur younger men . penile cancer common regions high prevalence human papillomavirus (hpv), approximately one-third half cancer cases attributed hpv-associated carcinogenesis . reports linking cancer human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) acquired immune deficiency syndrome (aids). summary, seems slight increase incidence seen western/developed countries, likely caused higher infection rates hpv trend also observed oropharynx carcinoma . figure 3.1: annual incidence rate (world standardised) world area
