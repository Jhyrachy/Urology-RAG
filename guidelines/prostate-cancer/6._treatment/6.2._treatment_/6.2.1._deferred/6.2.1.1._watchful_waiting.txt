6.2.1.1. Watchful Waiting. Watchful waiting refers to conservative management for patients deemed unsuitable for curative treatment from the outset. The aim of WW is to balance the potential harms and benefits of early hormonal treatment, and patients are clinically ‘watched’ for the development of local or systemic progression with (imminent) disease-related complaints, at which stage they are then treated palliatively according to their symptoms in order to maintain QoL. Traditionally WW has meant waiting for symptoms of the tumour to develop and has, in some practices, not included regular follow-up in any active way. However, today we have evidence that early hormonal treatment could prolong short term survival (within a few years) for locally advanced disease, for patients with a PSAdt < twelve months, and for PSA-values over 30-50 ng/ml [479,480]. A more active follow-up of men on WW could therefore be beneficial, so that a local progression (often associated with a higher ISUP grade group), or start of metastatic spread, can be detected before they present with significant symptoms. Hormonal treatment could then be considered before symptoms emerge. The WW strategy should therefore be individualised and planned together with the patient. Biannual PSA, or annual after a period of stable disease, followed by DRE if PSA rises significantly, could then be of value, especially for men with a life expectancy > five years but unsuitable for curative treatment. There are two RCTs and one Cochrane review comparing the outcomes of WW to RP. The SPCG-4 study was a RCT from the pre-PSA era, randomising patients to either WW or RP [481]. The study found RP to provide superior CSS, OS and progression-free survival (PFS) compared to WW at a median follow-up of 23.6 years (range 3 weeks–28 years). However, the benefit in favour of RP over WW was only apparent after ten years. The PIVOT trial, a RCT conducted in the early PSA era, made a similar comparison between RP vs. WW in 731 men (50% with nonpalpable disease) but in contrast to the SPCG-4, it found little, to no, benefit of RP (cumulative incidence of all-cause death, RP vs. observation: 68% vs. 73%; RR: 0.92, 95% CI: 0.84–1.01) within a median follow-up period of 18.6 years (interquartile range, 16.6 to 20 years) [482]. Exploratory subgroup analysis showed that the borderline benefit from RP was most marked for intermediate-risk disease (RR: 0.84, 95% CI: 0.73–0.98) but there was no benefit in patients with low- or high-risk disease. Overall, no adverse effects on health related QoL (HRQoL) and psychological well-being was apparent in the first five years [483]. However, one of the criticisms of the PIVOT trial is the relatively high overall mortality rate in the WW group compared with more contemporary series. A Cochrane review performed a pooled analysis of RCTs comparing RP vs. WW [484]. Three studies were included; the previously mentioned SPCG-4 [481] and PIVOT [482] and the Veteran’s Administration Cooperative Urological Research Group (VACURG) study which was conducted in the pre-PSA era [485]. The authors found that RP compared with WW reduced time to death by any cause (HR: 0.79, 95% CI: 0.70–0.90), time to death by PCa (HR: 0.57, 95% CI: 0.44–0.73) and time to metastatic progression (HR: 0.56, 95% CI: 0.46–0.70) at 29 years’ follow-up. However, RP was associated with higher rates of urinary incontinence (RR: 3.97, 95% CI: 2.34–6.74) and ED (RR: 2.67, 95% CI: 1.63–4.38). The overall evidence indicates that for men with asymptomatic, clinically localised PCa, and with a life expectancy of < ten years based on comorbidities and/or age, the oncological advantages of active treatment over WW are unlikely to be relevant to them. Consequently, WW should be adopted for such patients. For assistance in estimating life expectancy and health status see Section 5.4.
