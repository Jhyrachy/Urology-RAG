4.1.4.1.2. Adjustment of other medication. Although LUTS are listed as adverse effects of many drugs, this mainly derives from uncontrolled individual patient reports and post-marketing surveillance. Few controlled studies used the occurrence of LUTS as a primary outcome or were powered to assess the occurrence of statistically significant LUTS, or worsening rates against placebo. In most cases, it is therefore not possible to be sure that any drug causes OAB/LUTS. A structured scoping review failed to identify any studies addressing whether adjustment of specific medications could alter existing symptoms of OAB.
