6.3.3. Sequencing of surgery in the case of multiple sites. In general, surgery should commence at the site with the highest volume of residual disease. The histology of the mass diverges in different organ sites [212]. In cases of residual retroperitoneal and lung masses, the presence of fibro-necrotic tissue in the retroperitoneum is associated with a probability as high as 90%, that lung masses contain the same histology [229]. When pathologic examination of the lesions from the initial side show complete necrosis, observation may be considered when there are multiple contralateral tumours for which resection may be challenging. Discordant histology between lung sites, however, may occur in up to 20% of cases and thus, patients in this situation should be closely monitored with reconsideration of surgery or biopsy if radiological features change [230,231]. 6.3.3.1. Quality and intensity of surgery Resection of visceral structures and/or major vessels, requiring vascular reconstruction/replacement may be required to achieve radical resection and patients undergoing adjunctive complex surgery have a greater risk of complications [232,233]. In patients with intermediate- or poor-risk and residual disease > 5 cm, the probability of vascular procedures is as high as 20% [234]. These cases must therefore be referred to specialised centres capable of interdisciplinary surgery (gastro-enteric and vascular surgery, spinal neurosurgery, thoracic surgery). Even with centralisation of treatment, the median number of RPLNDs performed per surgeon/year in the U.K. is six [235]. Nevertheless, patients treated within such centres benefit from a significant reduction in peri-operative mortality from 6% to 0.8% [236]. In addition, specialised urologic surgeons are capable of reducing the local recurrence rate from 16% to 3% with a higher rate of complete resections [237]. 6.3.3.2. Salvage and desperation surgery Surgery of resectable disease after salvage treatment remains a potentially curative option in patients with any residual mass following salvage chemotherapy. Survival after surgery and first salvage chemotherapy improved by 70% at ten years, following taxane-containing regimens [238]. Even with extensive salvage chemotherapy, surgery remains a fundamental tool to achieve durable complete remissions in up to 20% of patients [239,240]. Desperation surgery refers to resection of non-responsive or progressive (e.g., rising markers) disease following salvage chemotherapy. When the disease is resectable, a significant proportion of these patients can be rendered disease-free in the long term [241]. 6.3.3.3. Consolidation chemotherapy after secondary surgery After resection of necrosis or post-pubertal teratoma, no further treatment is required. With incomplete resection of viable cancer, two adjuvant cycles of conventionally dosed cisplatin-based chemotherapy may be given in certain subgroups (e.g., poor-prognosis patients) [224]. Caution is required with cumulative doses of bleomycin which should not exceed 12 in total. With complete resection of active disease, comprising < 10% of the total volume of the mass, particularly in patients who initially had a good-prognosis based on IGCCCG criteria, the relapse rate is very low and adjuvant chemotherapy is not beneficial in preventing further relapse [242]. The prognosis is worse if malignant disease is present in masses resected after second- and third-line chemotherapy, although further chemotherapy is not indicated [243].
