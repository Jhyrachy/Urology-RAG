3.3. Aetiology and prevention. Stricture aetiology differs significantly throughout different regions in the world, due to differences in healthcare quality and environmental and practice patterns [26]. Regardless of geography, urethral stricture disease adversely impacts physical health and quality of life (QoL) [32,33], notwithstanding costs associated with the treatment of primary and recurrent disease [34,35]. The rationale for preventing urethral strictures is to avoid morbidity to the individual and costs to society. Prevention of urethral strictures encompasses reducing the causes of stricture (e.g., infection, trauma, iatrogenic injury) and where this is not possible, mitigating the risk.
