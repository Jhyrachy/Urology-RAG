3.3.4. Evidence summary. A systematic search of the literature from November 2016 to January 2000 identified 3,582 titles of which 224 were selected for full text review and 50 were included [30]. For the subgroups of pregnancy, prior to urologic surgeries, post-menopausal women and institutionalised elderly patients only data from RCTs were included, on which a meta-analysis was performed [30]. For the other subgroups non-RCTs were also included in the narrative analysis [30]. An update systematic literature search from 1st December 2016 to 1st June 2023 identified 1,503 titles of which 36 were selected for full text review and 18 were included. The following patient populations were not covered by the systematic review: immuno-compromised patients; and patients with indwelling catheters. For these groups the guideline was updated using a structured PubMed search. The evidence question addressed was: What is the most effective management for people with asymptomatic bacteriuria?
