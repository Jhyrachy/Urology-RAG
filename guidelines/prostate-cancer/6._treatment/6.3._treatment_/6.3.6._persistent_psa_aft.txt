6.3.6. Persistent PSA after radical prostatectomy. Between five and 20% of men continue to have detectable or persistent PSA after RP (when defined in the majority of studies as detectable post-RP PSA of ≥ 0.1 ng/mL within 4 to 8 weeks of surgery) [859,860]. It may result from persistent local disease, pre-existing metastases or residual benign prostate tissue. 6.3.6.1. Natural history of persistently elevated PSA after RP Several studies have shown that persistent PSA after RP is associated with more advanced disease (such as positive surgical margins, pathologic stage ≥ T3a, positive nodal status and/or pathologic ISUP grade group > 3) and poor prognosis. Initially defined as ≥ 0.1 ng/mL, improvements in the sensitivity of PSA assays now allow for the detection of PSA at much lower levels. Moreira et al., demonstrated that failure to achieve a PSA of less than 0.03 ng/mL within six months of surgery was associated with an increased risk of BCR and overall mortality [861,862]. However, since the majority of the published literature is based on the 0.1 ng/mL PSA cut-off, there is significantly more longterm data for this definition. Predictors of PSA persistence were higher BMI, higher pre-operative PSA and ISUP grade group ≥ 3 [862]. In patients with PSA persistence, one and 5-year BCR-free survival were 68% and 36%, compared to 95% and 72%, respectively, in men without PSA persistence [861]. Ten-year OS in patients with and without PSA persistence was 63% and 80%, respectively. Spratt et al., confirmed that a persistently detectable PSA after RP represents one of the worst prognostic factors associated with oncological outcome [863]. Of 150 patients with a persistent PSA, 95% received RT before detectable metastasis. In a multi-variable analysis the presence of a persistently detectable PSA post-RP was associated with a 4-fold increase in the risk of developing metastasis. This was confirmed by data from Preisser et al., who showed that persistent PSA is prognostic of an increased risk of metastasis and death [864]. At 15 years after RP, MFS rates, OS and CSS rates were 53.0 vs. 93.2% (p < 0.001), 64.7 vs. 81.2% (p < 0.001) and 75.5 vs. 96.2% (p < 0.001) for persistent vs. undetectable PSA, respectively. The median follow-up was 61.8 months for patients with undetectable PSA vs. 46.4 months for patients with persistent PSA. In multivariable Cox regression models, persistent PSA represented an independent predictor for metastasis (HR: 3.59, p < 0.001), death (HR: 1.86, p < 0.001) and cancer-specific death (HR: 3.15, p < 0.001). However, not all patients with persistent PSA after RP experience disease recurrence. Xiang et al., showed a 50% 5-year BCR-free survival in men who had a persistent PSA level > 0.1 but ≤ 0.2 ng/mL at 6–8 weeks after RP [865]. Rogers et al., assessed the clinical outcome of 160 men with a persistently detectable PSA level after RP [866]. No patient received adjuvant therapy before documented metastasis. In their study, 38% of patients had no evidence of metastases for ≥ 7 years while 32% of the patients were reported to develop metastases within 3 years. Noteworthy is that a significant proportion of patients had low-risk disease. In multi-variable analysis the PSA slope after RP (as calculated using PSA levels 3 to twelve months after surgery) and pathological ISUP grade group were significantly associated with the development of distant metastases. 6.3.6.2. Imaging in patients with persistently elevated PSA after RP Standard imaging with bone scan and MRI has a low detection rate in men with a PSA below 2 ng/mL. However, PSMA PET/CT has been shown to identify residual cancer with positivity rates of 33%, 46%, 57%, 82%, and 97%, in men with post-RP PSA ranges of 0–0.19, 0.2–0.49, 0.5–0.99, 1–1.99, and ≥ 2 ng/mL, respectively [867-872] which can guide SRT planning [873]. Based on these post-RP PSA ranges, Schmidt-Hegemann et al., studied 129 patients who had either persistent PSA (52%) or BCR (48%) after RP, showing that men with a persistent PSA had significantly more pelvic nodal involvement on PSMA PET/CT than those developing a detectable PSA [874]. In a multi-centre retrospective study including 191 patients, 68Ga-PSMA localised biochemical persistence after RP in more than two-thirds of patients with high-risk PCa features. The obturator and presacral or mesorectal nodes were identified as high risk for residual disease [875]. Another retrospective study included 150 patients with persistent PSA after RARP who were re-staged with both 68Ga-PSMA and 18F-DCFPyL PSMA. The authors found that in the presence of persistent PSA the majority of patients already had metastatic pelvic LNs or distant metastases which would support a role of PSMA PET/ CT imaging in guiding (salvage) treatment strategies [876]. At present there is uncertainty regarding the best treatment if PSMA PET/CT shows metastatic disease outside the pelvis. 6.3.6.3. Impact of post-operative RT and/or ADT in patients with persistent PSA The benefit of SRT in patients with persistent PSA remains unclear due to a lack of RCTs, however, it would appear that men with a persistent PSA do less well than men with BCR undergoing RT. Preisser et al., compared oncological outcomes of patients with persistent PSA who received SRT vs. those who did not [864]. In the subgroup of patients with persistent PSA, after 1:1 propensity score matching between patients with SRT vs. no RT, OS rates at ten years after RP were 86.6 vs. 72.6% in the entire cohort (p < 0.01), 86.3 vs. 60.0% in patients with positive surgical margin (p = 0.02), 77.8 vs. 49.0% in pT3b disease (p < 0.001), 79.3 vs. 55.8% in ISUP grade group 1 disease (p < 0.01) and 87.4 vs. 50.5% in pN1 disease (p < 0.01), respectively. Moreover, CSS rates at ten years after RP were 93.7 vs. 81.6% in the entire cohort (p < 0.01), 90.8 vs. 69.7% in patients with positive surgical margin (p = 0.04), 82.7 vs. 55.3% in pT3b disease (p < 0.01), 85.4 vs. 69.7% in ISUP grade group 1 disease (p < 0.01) and 96.2 vs. 55.8% in pN1 disease (p < 0.01), for SRT vs. no RT, respectively. In multivariable models, after 1:1 propensity score matching, SRT was associated with lower risk of death (HR: 0.42, p = 0.02) and lower cancer-specific death (HR: 0.29, p = 0.03). These survival outcomes in patients with persistent PSA who underwent SRT suggest they benefit but outcomes are worse than for men experiencing BCR [877]. It is clear from a number of studies that poor outcomes are driven by the level of pre-RT PSA, the presence of ISUP grade group ≥ 4 in the RP histology and pT3b disease [878-883]. Fossati et al., suggested that only men with a persistent PSA after RP and ISUP grade group ≤ 3 benefit significantly [884], although this is not supported by Preisser et al. [864]. The current data do not allow making any clear treatment decisions. Addition of ADT may improve PFS [879]. Choo et al., studied the addition of 2-year ADT to immediate RT to the prostate bed in patients with pT3 and/or positive surgical margins after RP [879]. Twenty-nine of the 78 included patients had persistently detectable post-operative PSA. The relapse-free rate was 85% at five years and 68% at 7 years, which was superior to the 5-year progression-free estimates of 74% and 61% in the post-operative RT arms of the EORTC and the SWOG studies, respectively, which included patients with undetectable PSA after RP [835,836]. Patients with persistently detectable post-operative PSA comprised approximately 50% and 12%, respectively, of the study cohorts in the EORTC and the SWOG studies. In the ARO 96-02, a prospective RCT, 74 patients with PSA persistence (20%) received immediate SRT only (66 Gy per protocol [arm C]). The 10-year clinical relapse-free survival was 63% [878]. The GETUG-22 trial comparing RT with RT plus short-term ADT for post-RP PSA persistence (0.2–2.0 ng/mL) reported good tolerability of the combined treatment. The oncological endpoints are yet to be published [885]. Two SRs addressing persistent PSA confirmed a strong correlation of PSA persistence with poor oncologic outcomes [859,860]. Ploussard et al., also reported that SRT was associated with improved survival outcomes, although the available evidence is of low quality [860]. 6.3.6.4. Conclusion The available data suggest that patients with PSA persistence after RP may benefit from early aggressive multi-modality treatment, however, the lack of prospective RCTs makes firm recommendations difficult. 6.3.6.5.
