4.3. Risk factors for relapse in clinical stage I testicular cancer. For CS I seminoma germ cell tumour (SGCT), primary tumour size and stromal invasion of the rete testis have been identified to be associated with relapse risk in a pooled analysis of retrospective data [32]. Absence of both factors was associated with a low risk of recurrence (6%) [35]. Whilst the original analysis was not supported by a subsequent retrospective report [33], some prospective series [34-36] have supported the prognostic significance of tumour size and stromal invasion of the rete testis. Two SRs assessed the prognostic value of both risk factors [37,38]. While tumour size (continuous or dichotomised) and rete testis invasion were associated with a higher risk of relapse, both SRs highlighted the low quality of the studies included and concluded that the level of evidence was too low to be able to recommend the use of both risk factors to drive adjuvant treatment decisions [37,38]. For CS I NSGCT, invasion of the primary tumour into blood or lymphatic vessels, (i.e. lymphovascular invasion (LVI)), was strongly associated with the risk of relapse disease [39-41]. No other risk factors have the same level of validation for prognostic significance [42]. While interobserver agreement is variable, immunohistochemistry with vascular markers may improve detection of LVI [43]. The percentage of embryonal carcinoma within a tumour may enhance the positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of LVI [40], but there is no definitive prognostic cut-off for percentage [40]. Risk of relapse at five years according to historical figures, for patients with LVI-positive tumours was 50% vs. 15% in patients with LVI-negative tumours.
