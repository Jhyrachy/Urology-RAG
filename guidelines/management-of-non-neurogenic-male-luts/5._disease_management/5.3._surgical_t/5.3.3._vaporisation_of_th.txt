5.3.3. Vaporisation of the prostate. 5.3.3.1. Bipolar transurethral vaporisation of the prostate Mechanism of action: Mechanism of action: Bipolar transurethral vaporisation of the prostate (B-TUVP) utilises a bipolar electrode and a high-frequency generator to create plasma field (thin layer of highly ionised particles) to vaporise prostatic tissue [460]. Bipolar transurethral vaporisation of the prostate displays thinner (< 2 mm) coagulation zones [461], compared to monopolar TUVP (up to 10 mm) [462], potentially resulting in fewer irritative side-effects and SUI [461,463,464]. Efficacy: Bipolar-TUVP has been compared to TURP in thirteen RCTs, including a total of 1,244 men with a prostate size of < 80 mL [334,465-476]. Early RCTs evaluated the PK B-TUVP system [465-469]; however, during the last decade, only the “plasma” B-TUVP system with the “mushroom- or button-like” electrode (Olympus, Medical) has been evaluated [334,470-476]. Results have been pooled in three meta-analyses [320,477,478], and a narrative synthesis has been produced in two SRs [320,479]. Follow-up in most RCTs is twelve months [465-468,470-472,474,476] with the longest being 36 months in a small RCT (n = 40) and eighteen months in a subsequent RCT (n = 340); evaluating PK [469] and plasma B-TUVP [334], respectively. Pooled results from meta-analyses concluded that no significant differences exist in short-term efficacy (IPSS, QoL score, Qmax and PVR) between PK B-TUVP and TURP [320,340,478] and this was confirmed in a separate SR of seven RCTs [479]. However, the promising initial efficacy profile of the former may be compromised by inferior clinical outcomes (IPSS and Qmax) at mid-term. Higher quality RCTs with longer follow-up are necessary to draw definite conclusions on mid and long-term outcomes [320,469]. Tolerability and safety: Early pooled results concluded that no statistically significant differences exist for intra-operative and short-term complications between PK B-TUVP and TURP, but peri-operative complications are significantly fewer after B-TUVP [320]. However, the results of a statistical analysis comparing pooled specific complication rates were not directly reported in this meta-analysis [320]. Mid-term complications (urethral stricture, ED, and retrograde ejaculation) are similar [469], but larger RCTs with longer follow-up are necessary to draw definite conclusions [320,469]. A SR of seven RCTs comparing PK and plasma B-TUVP with TURP concluded that most RCTs shorter catheterisation (42.5 vs. 77.5 hours) and hospitalisation times (3.1 vs. 4.4 days) with B-TUVP [479], but another SR concluded that heterogeneity of RCTs, and methodological limitations do not permit firm conclusions [320]. A meta-analysis reported that B-TUVP has shorter and similar catheterisation time compared to M-TURP and B-TURP, respectively; significantly fewer clot retentions/blood transfusions compared to M-TURP but not B-TURP; and no difference in other complication rates compared to either TURP technique [340]. A meta-analysis of six RCTs specifically evaluating plasma B-TUVP vs. TURP, concluded that no significant differences exist between the techniques in overall complication and transfusion rates [478]. However, a statistically significant difference was detected in major complication rates (Clavien 3, 4), including urethral stricture, severe bleeding necessitating re-operation and UI, and in the duration of catheterisation, favouring plasma B-TUVP. Practical considerations: Bipolar-TUVP and PK TUVP have similar short-term efficacy to TURP, but with a favourable short-term safety profile. However, heterogeneity of RCTs, non-standardised techniques and methodological limitations do not permit firm conclusions, and multicentre, long-term RCTs s are needed. Summary of evidenceLEBipolar-TUVP and TURP have similar short-term efficacy.1aPlasmakinetic B-TUVP has a favourable peri-operative profile, similar mid-term safety but inferior mid-term efficacy compared to TURP.1aPlasma B-TUVP has a lower short-term major morbidity rate compared to TURP.1a RecommendationStrength ratingOffer bipolar transurethral vaporisation of the prostate as an alternative to transurethral resection of the prostate to surgically treat moderate-to-severe LUTS in men with a prostate volume of 30-80 mL.Weak 5.3.3.2. 532 nm (‘Greenlight’) laser vaporisation of the prostate Mechanism of action: The KTP and LBO lasers have been described in section 5.3.2.6.2. Efficacy: Meta-analyses of RCTs comparing photoselective vaporisation of the prostate (PVP) using the 80-W and 120-W lasers with TURP have reported no difference in Qmax and IPSS between 80-W or 120-W PVP and TURP [480,481]. Another meta-analysis of four RCTs including 559 patients, on the 120-W laser, demonstrated no significant difference in functional and symptomatic parameters at 24-month follow-up when compared to TURP [482]. A meta-analysis of two RCTs reported similar efficacy of 120-W PVP, compared to M-TURP at 36-months follow-up [340]. The only available RCT for the 180-W laser reported non-inferiority to TURP in terms of IPSS, Qmax, PVR, prostate volume reduction, PSA decrease and QoL questionnaires. Efficacy outcomes were similar to TURP with stable results at 24-months follow-up [483]. One RCT comparing HoLEP to PVP, in patients with prostates > 60 mL, showed comparable symptom improvement, but significantly higher flow rates and lower PVR volume after HoLEP at short-term follow-up; in addition, PVP showed a 22% conversion rate to TURP [484]. One RCT compared B-TUVP with PVP with the 180-W XPS Laser. Comparable improvement in IPSS and Qmax were reported at 24-months follow-up [485]. Tolerability and safety: A meta-analysis of RCTs comparing the 80-W and 120-W lasers with TURP showed shorter catheterisation time (mean difference 32 hours) and length of hospital stay (mean difference 1.85 days) after PVP [320]. Blood transfusions and clot retention were less with PVP. No difference was noted in post-operative urinary retention, UTI, meatal stenosis, urethral stricture, or bladder neck stenosis [320]. A meta-analysis including trials with the 120-W laser likewise reported lower transfusion rates, catheterisation time and duration of hospital stay compared to TURP. Re-operation rates and operation time were in favour of TURP. No significant differences were demonstrated for treatment for urethral stricture, BNC, incidence of incontinence and UTI [482]. A meta-analysis confirmed that PVP was superior to both M-TURP/B-TURP with regard to catheterisation and to M-TURP but not to B-TURP with regard to transfusion rate and clot retention [340]. In an RCT comparing the 120-W HPS laser with TURP, with a follow-up of 36-months, the re-operation rate was significantly higher after PVP (11% vs. 1.8%) [486]. 180-W Greenlight laser prostatectomy is non-inferior to TURP in terms of peri-operative complications. Re-operation free survival during a 24-month follow-up was comparable between the TURP-arm and the 180-W XPS laser-arm [483]. A retrospective feasibility study on 537 patients with a median follow-up of 31 months, of which 517 were treated in an outpatient basis, showed that outpatient PVP with the 180-W XPS laser can be performed safely with a low re-admission and complication rate [487]. One retrospective long-term follow up study on 21,869 patients treated in twenty centres in Finland compared short-term and long-term morbidity in patients undergoing monopolar or bipolar TURP or any of the three generations of PVP [488]. Re-operations for bleeding were less frequent after PVP. Cumulative incidence for re-operation was higher after PVP (23.5%) than after TURP in long-term follow-up (17.8%) [488]. Based mostly on case series, the 80-,120- and 180-W Greenlight laser appears to be safe in high-risk patients undergoing anticoagulation treatment [489-492]; however, patients under anticoagulation therapy were either excluded from or represented a very small sample in currently available RCTs. In one study, anticoagulated patients had significantly higher rates of bladder irrigation (17.2%) compared with those not taking anticoagulants (5.4%) [492]. In contrast, another retrospective study focusing on the 180-W LBO laser did not find any significant differences between patients receiving or not receiving anticoagulants [493]. A retrospective study of a mixed cohort of patients, treated with 80-W KTP PVP and 120-W LBO HPS, revealed that delayed gross haematuria was common in patients (33.8%) during an average follow-up of 33 months [494]. A retrospective review of a database of patients undergoing 180-W PVP, without interruption of anticoagulation therapy, had a 30.5% rate of peri-operative adverse events with a significant occurrence of high grade Clavien Dindo events [495]. Safety in patients with urinary retention, impaired detrusor contractility, elderly patients or prostates > 80 mL was shown in various prospective short-term non-randomised trials. A retrospective study on 1,077 patients [496] with a median eighteen months follow-up, compared the functional results and the safety profile of PVP in patients younger and older than 75 years of age. The authors did not find any differences in terms of complications in older patients, with only 0.6% of Clavien III and an overall complications rate of 29.6%. Data on functional outcomes in the older group of patients, showed amelioration of all parameters from the baseline, with 111.7% of improvement of peak flow and 69.5% of IPSS reduction without statistical differences with the counterparts at twelve months. However this similarity of results disappears by extending the study period up to a median of eighteen months, underlying the fact that younger patients maintain their improvement more than older patients, who nevertheless maintain a relevant improvement compared to their baseline [496]. No RCT including prostates > 100 mL has been reported; therefore, comparison of retreatment rates between prostate volumes of different sizes is not possible [497-499]. A meta-analysis of five RCTs comparing collectively all three “Greenlight” lasers with TURP detected no difference in retrograde ejaculation rates [415]. Additional studies have also reported no difference between OP/TURP and Greenlight PVP for erectile function [500,501]. However, IIEF-5 scores were significantly decreased at six-, twelve-, and 24- months in patients with pre-operative IIEF-5 greater than nineteen [502]. No significant difference with respect to peri- and post-operative complications was reported in an RCT comparing B-TUVP and PVP with the 180-W XPS Laser. Redo TURP for recurrent adenoma was required in 9.8% (B-TUVP) and 1.7% (PVP) of the patients during 24-months follow-up, respectively [485]. Practical considerations: The 180-W XPS represents the current standard of generators for PVP; however, the number and quality of supporting publications are low, especially for large glands (> 100 mL), with no long-term follow-up. Summary of evidenceLELaser vaporisation of the prostate using the 80-W KTP and the 120-W LBO laser (PVP) demonstrated higher intra-operative safety with regard to haemostatic properties when compared to TURP. Peri-operative parameters such as catheterisation time and hospital stay are in favour of PVP, whereas operation time and risk of re-operation are in favour of TURP. Short-term results for the 80-W KTP laser and mid-term results for the 120-W LBO laser were comparable to TURP.1aLaser vaporisation of the prostate using the 180-W LBO laser (PVP) demonstrated higher intra-operative safety with regard to haemostatic properties when compared to TURP.

Vaporisation techniques under investigation 5.3.3.3.1. Diode laser vaporisation of the prostate Mechanism of action: Diode lasers with a wavelength of 980 nm are marketed for prostate vaporisation; however, only a few have been evaluated in clinical trials [350]. Efficacy: Two RCTs for 120-W 980 nm diode laser vaporisation vs. M-TURP are available [503,504]. The first RCT with 24-month follow-up reported similar efficacy (IPSS, Qmax and PVR) at one and six months. However, at twelve- and 24-months improvements in IPSS and Qmax were significantly in favour of TURP, and repeat TURP was more frequent in the diode laser group [503]. The second RCT reported equivalent results for both interventions at three-month follow-up [504]. Tolerability and safety: A meta-analysis comparing diode laser vaporisation vs. M-TURP reported shorter catheterisation time and lower transfusion rates for diode laser vaporisation [340]. In an RCT reflecting on peri-operative and post-operative complications no significant differences were demonstrated for clot retention, AUR after catheter removal, UUI and UTI [503]. Moreover, for late complications no significant differences could be demonstrated for re-operation rate, urethral stricture, bladder neck sclerosis, de novo sexual dysfunction and mean time of dysuria [503]. Published studies on 980 nm diode laser vaporisation indicate high haemostatic potential, although anticoagulants or platelet aggregation inhibitors were taken in 24% and 52% of patients, respectively [505,506]. In a number of studies, a high rate of post-operative dysuria was reported [503,505-507]. Early publications on diode vaporisation reported high re-operation rates (8-33%) and persisting SUI (9.1%) [503,505-507]. Practical considerations: Diode laser vaporisation leads to similar improvements in clinical and symptomatic parameters during short-term follow-up and provides good haemostatic properties. Based on the limited number of mainly low quality RCTs, and controversial data on the retreatment rate, results for diode laser vaporisation should be evaluated in further higher quality RCTs. Summary of evidenceLELaser vaporisation of the prostate using the 120-W 980 nm diode laser demonstrated high intra-operative safety with regard to haemostatic properties when compared to TURP. Peri-operative parameters like catheterisation time and hospital stay were in favour of diode lasers. Evidence is limited by the number and quality of the available studies.1bIn a number of studies, post-operative complications such as severe storage symptoms and persisting incontinence, occurred with laser vaporisation of the prostate using the 120-W 980 nm diode laser.3Laser vaporisation using the 120-W 980 nm diode laser seems to be safe with regard to haemostasis in patients receiving anticoagulant therapy.3
