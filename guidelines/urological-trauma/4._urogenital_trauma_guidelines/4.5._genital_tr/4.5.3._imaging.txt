4.5.3. Imaging. In cases of suspected penile fracture cavernosography, US or contrast-enhanced MRI [302,329-331] can identify lacerations of the tunica albuginea in unclear cases [332], or provide reassurance that the tunica is intact. Magnetic resonance imaging is superior to US in diagnosing penile fracture [333,334]. If a concomitant urethral injury is suspected, manage as outlined in section 4.4. Ultrasound should be performed to determine intra- and/or extra-testicular haematoma, testicular contusion, or rupture [322,335-343]. However, the literature is contradictory as to the usefulness of US compared to clinical examination alone. Some studies have reported convincing findings with a specificity of up to 98.6% [344]. Heterogeneous echo pattern of the testicular parenchyma with the loss of contour definition is a highly sensitive and specific radiographic finding for testicular rupture [333]. Others reported poor specificity (78%) and sensitivity (28%) for the differentiation between testicular rupture and haematocele, while accuracy is as low as 56% [336]. Colour Doppler-duplex US may provide useful information when used to evaluate testicular perfusion. If scrotal US is inconclusive, testicular CT or MRI may be helpful [345]; however, these techniques did not specifically increase the detection rates of testicular rupture [346].
