8.2.3.1.5. Summary of evidence and recommendations for conservative treatment of Peyronie’s disease. Summary of evidenceLEConservative treatment for PD is primarily aimed at treating patients in the early stage of the disease in order to relieve symptoms and prevent progression.3cThere is no convincing evidence supporting oral treatment with acetyl esters of carnitine, vitamin E, potassium para-aminobenzoate (potaba) and pentoxifylline.3cDue to adverse effects, treatment with oral tamoxifen is no longer recommended.3cNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can be used to treat pain in the acute phase.4Contradictory evidence is available for intralesional treatment with calcium channel antagonists: verapamil and nicardipine.4Intralesional treatment with Collagenase clostridium histolyticum showed significant decreases in penile curvature, plaque diameter and plaque length in men with stable disease.1bIntralesional treatment with interferon may improve penile curvature, plaque size, density, and pain.2bIntralesional treatment with steroids hase been shown to have adverse effects, including tissue atrophy, thinning of the skin and immunosuppression.3cNo high-level evidence is available to support treatment with intralesional hyaluronic acid or botulinum toxin.3cIntralesional hyaluronic acid may be used to improve pain, penile curvature and IIEF scores.2bA combination of oral and intralesional hyaluronic acid treatment improves penile curvature and plaque size.1bThere is no evidence that topical treatments applied to the penile shaft result in adequate levels of the active compound within the tunica albuginea.3cThere is no efficacy data for the use of iontophoresis.3cExtracorporeal shockwave treatment may be offered to treat penile pain, but it does not improve penile curvature and plaque size.2bTreatment with penile traction therapy alone or in combination with injectable therapy as part of a multimodal approach may reduce penile curvature and increase penile length, although the available studies have considerable limitations.3c RecommendationStrength ratingOffer conservative treatment to patients not fit for surgery or when surgery is not acceptable to the patient.StrongFully counsel patients regarding all available treatment options and outcomes before starting any treatment.StrongDo not offer oral treatment with vitamin E, potassium para-aminobenzoate (potaba), tamoxifen, pentoxifylline, colchicine and acetyl esters of carnitine to treat Peyronie’s disease (PD).StrongUse nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to treat penile pain in the acute phase of PD.StrongUse extracorporeal shockwave treatment (ESWT) to treat penile pain in the acute phase of PD.WeakUse phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors to treat concomitant erectile dysfunction or if the deformity results in difficulty in penetrative intercourse in order to optimise penetration.WeakOffer intralesional therapy with interferon alpha-2b to patients with stable curvature dorsal or lateral > 30o seeking a minimal invasive procedure.WeakOffer intralesional therapy with Collagenase Clostridium Histolyticum to patients with stable PD and dorsal or lateral curvature > 300, who request non-surgical treatment, although the placebo effects are high.StrongDo not offer intralesional treatment with steroids to reduce penile curvature, plaque size or pain.StrongDo not use intralesional platelet-rich plasma or hyaluronic acid, either alone or in combination with oral treatment, to reduce penile curvature, plaque size or pain outside the confines of a clinical trial.StrongDo not offer ESWT to improve penile curvature and reduce plaque size.StrongOffer penile traction devices and vacuum devices to reduce penile deformity or as part of a multimodal therapy approach, although outcome data is limited.Weak
