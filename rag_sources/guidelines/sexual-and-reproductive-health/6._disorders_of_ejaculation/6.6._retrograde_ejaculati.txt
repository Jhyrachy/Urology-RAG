6.6. retrograde ejaculation. 6.6.1. definition classification retrograde ejaculation total, sometimes partial, absence antegrade ejaculation, due semen passing backwards bladder neck bladder. patients may experience normal decreased orgasmic sensation. causes retrograde ejaculation divided neurogenic, pharmacological, urethral, bladder neck incompetence . 6.6.2. pathophysiology risk factors process ejaculation requires complex co-ordination interplay epididymis, vas deferens, prostate, seminal vesicles, bladder neck bulbourethral glands . upon ejaculation, sperm rapidly conveyed along vas deferens urethra via ejaculatory ducts. there, semen progresses antegrade fashion, partly maintained coaptation bladder neck rhythmic contractions periurethral muscles, co-ordinated centrally mediated reflex . closure bladder neck seminal emission initiated via sympathetic nervous system lumbar sympathetic ganglia subsequently hypogastric nerve. prostatic seminal vesicle secretion, well contraction bulbo-cavernosal, ischio-cavernosal pelvic floor muscles initiated 2-4 parasympathetic nervous system via pelvic nerve . factor disrupts reflex inhibits contraction bladder neck (internal vesical sphincter) may lead retrograde passage semen bladder. broadly categorised pharmacological, neurogenic, anatomic endocrinal causes retrograde ejaculation (table 14). table 14: aetiology retrograde ejaculation aetiology retrograde ejaculationneurogenicspinal cord injurycauda equina lesionsmultiple sclerosisautonomic neuropathyretroperitoneal lymphadenectomysympathectomy aortoiliac surgeryprostate, colorectal anal surgeryparkinson´s diseasediabetes mellituspsychological/behaviouralurethralectopic ureteroceleurethral strictureurethral valves verumontaneum hyperplasiacongenital dopamine β-hydroxylase deficiencypharmacologicalantihypertensives, thiazide diureticsα-1-adrenoceptor antagonistsantipsychotics antidepressantsendocrinehypothyroidismhypogonadismhyperprolactinaemiabladder neck incompetencecongenital defects/dysfunction hemitrigonebladder neck resection (transurethral resection prostate)prostatectomy 6.6.3. disease management 6.6.3.1. pharmacological sympathomimetics stimulate release noradrenaline activate α- β-adrenergic receptors, resulting closure internal urethral sphincter, restoring antegrade flow semen. common sympathomimetics synephrine, pseudoephedrine hydrochloride, ephedrine, phenylpropanolamine midodrine . unfortunately, time progresses, effect diminishes . many studies published efficacy sympathomimetics treatment retrograde ejaculation suffer small sample size, represented case reports. rct randomised patients receive one four α-adrenergic agents (dextroamphetamine, ephedrine, phenylpropanolamine pseudoephedrine) without histamine. patients suffered failure ejaculation following retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy. found four days treatment prior ejaculation effective adrenergic agonists restored antegrade ejaculation . systematic review, efficacy group medications found 28% . adverse effects sympathomimetics include dryness mucous membranes hypertension. use antimuscarinics described, including brompheniramine maleate imipramine, well combination sympathomimetics. calculated efficacy antimuscarinics alone combination sympathomimetics 22% 39%, respectively . combination therapy appears effective, although statistical analysis yet possible due small sample sizes. 6.6.3.2. management infertility infertility major concern patients retrograde ejaculation. beyond standard sperm-retrieval techniques, testicular sperm aspiration/extraction (tesa/tese), three different methods sperm acquisition identified managing infertility patients retrograde ejaculation. include: i) centrifugation resuspension post-ejaculatory urine specimens; ii) hotchkiss (or modified hotchkiss) technique; and, iii) ejaculation full bladder. centrifugation resuspension. order improve ambient conditions sperm, patient asked increase fluid intake take sodium bicarbonate dilute alkalise urine, respectively. afterwards, post-orgasmic urine sample collected introducing catheter spontaneous voiding. sample centrifuged suspended medium. types suspension fluids heterogeneous include bovine serum albumin, human serum albumin, earle’s/hank’s balanced salt solution patient’s urine. resultant modified sperm mixture used assisted reproductive techniques. systematic review studies couples male partner retrograde ejaculation found 15% pregnancy rate per cycle (0-100%) .hotchkiss method. hotchkiss method involves emptying bladder prior ejaculation, using catheter, washing instilling small quantity lactated ringers improve ambient condition bladder. patient ejaculates, semen retrieved catheterisation voiding . modified hotchkiss methods involve variance instillation medium. pregnancy rates 24% per cycle (0-100%) .ejaculation full bladder. patient encouraged ejaculate full bladder semen suspended baker’s buffer. pregnancy rate two studies, included five patients, described results using technique .
