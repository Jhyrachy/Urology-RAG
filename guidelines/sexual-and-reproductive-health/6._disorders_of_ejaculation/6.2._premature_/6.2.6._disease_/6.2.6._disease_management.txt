6.2.6. Disease management. Before commencing any treatment, it is essential to define the subtype of PE and discuss patient’s expectations thoroughly. Pharmacotherapy must be considered the first-line treatment for patients with lifelong PE, whereas treating the underlying cause (e.g., ED, prostatitis, LUTS, anxiety and hyperthyroidism) must be the initial goal for patients with acquired PE [601]. Various behavioural techniques may be beneficial in treating variable and subjective PE [621]. Psychotherapy can also be considered for PE patients who are uncomfortable with pharmacological therapy or in combination with pharmacological therapy [622,623]. However, there is weak and inconsistent evidence regarding the effectiveness of these psychosexual interventions and their long-term outcomes in PE are unknown [624]. Dapoxetine (30 and 60 mg) is the first on-demand oral pharmacological agent approved for lifelong and acquired PE in many countries, except for the USA [625]. The metered-dose aerosol spray of lidocaine (150 mg/mL) and prilocaine (50 mg/mL) combination is the first topical formulation to be officially approved for on-demand treatment of lifelong PE by the EMA in the European Union [626]. All other medications used in PE are off-label indications [627]. In this context, daily or on-demand use of selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and clomipramine and on-demand topical anaesthetic agents have consistently shown efficacy in PE [628-631]. The long-term outcomes of pharmacological treatments are unknown. An evidence-based analysis of all current treatment modalities was performed. Levels of evidence and grades of recommendation are provided, and a treatment algorithm is presented (Figure 6).
