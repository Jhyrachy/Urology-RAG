3.2.5. undescended testes fertility. association undescended testes compromised fertility extensively discussed literature seems result multiple factors, including germ cell loss, impaired germ cell maturation , leydig cell diminution testicular fibrosis . although boys one undescended testis lower fertility rate, paternity rate bilateral descended testes. boys bilateral undescended testes suffer lower fertility paternity rates. fertility rate number offspring born per mating pair, individual population whereas paternity reflects actual potential fatherhood . age surgical intervention undescended testis occurs seems important predictive factor fertility later life. endocrinological studies revealed higher inhibin-b lower follicle-stimulating hormone (fsh) levels men underwent orchidopexy two years age compared individuals surgery later, indicative benefit earlier orchidopexy . addition, others demonstrated relation undescended testes increased loss germ cells leydig cells, also suggestive prompt orchidopexy significant factor fertility preservation . outcome studies untreated bilateral undescended testes revealed 100% oligospermic 75% azoospermic. among successfully treated bilateral undescended testes, 75% still remain oligospermic 42% azoospermic . summary, early surgical correction undescended testes highly recommended twelve months age, eighteen months latest preservation fertility potential .
