3.15. Vesicoureteric reflux. Lack of robust prospective RCTs limits the strength of the established guidelines for the management of VUR. The scientific literature for reflux disease is still limited and thus the level of evidence is generally low. Most of the studies are retrospective, include different patient groups, and have poor stratification of quality. Also, there is a high risk of presenting misleading results by combining different types of studies when systematically extracting data. Therefore, for reflux disease, it is unfortunately not possible to produce recommendations based on high-quality studies. These Guidelines aim to provide a practical approach to the treatment of VUR based on risk analysis and selective indications for both diagnostics and intervention. Although the Panel have tried to summarise most of the possible scenarios in one single table, the table itself is still quite busy. The Panel strongly share the view that making simple and practical guidelines would underestimate the complexity of VUR as a sign of a wide range of pathologies [916]. In a recent publication the EAU and ESPU Pediatric Guidelines Panel summarized and updated this chapter [1611].
