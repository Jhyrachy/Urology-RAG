4.1.1. history. history important evaluation patients chronic pelvic pain. pain syndromes symptomatic diagnoses, derived history pain perceived region pelvis, absence pathology, minimum three months. implies specific disease-associated pelvic pain caused bacterial infection, cancer, drug-induced pathology (e.g., ketamine use) , primary anatomical functional disease pelvic organs, neurogenic disease must ruled out. 4.1.1.1. anxiety, depression, overall function distress best understood context pain meaning pain individual best assessed ideographically rather normatively. almost diagnostic measures standardised instruments anxiety depression designed people without significant physical problems, difficult interpret chronic pelvic pain . anxiety pain often refers fears missed pathology (particularly cancer) cause pain , uncertainties treatment prognosis. drive healthcare seeking behaviour. question: “what believe fear cause pain?” suggested . anxiety may also concern urinary urgency frequency problematic social settings. depression depressed moods common chronic pain , often related losses consequent chronic pain (work, leisure activities, social relationships, etc.). due lack suitable assessment instruments, better ask simple question “how pain affect emotionally?” answer gives cause concern patient’s emotional state, assessment undertaken appropriately qualified colleague. measures restricted function designed primarily musculoskeletal pain may emphasise mobility problems rather difficulties individual pelvic urogenital pain. promising specific measure, upoint, introduced later version sexological aspects added . however, may underassess relevant psychological variables . generic qol measures helpful. instrument already used clinic, brief pain inventory provides broad economical assessment interference pain various aspects life, available multiple languages. (for suggested instruments see ). 4.1.1.2. urological aspects pain may associated urological symptoms. detailed history lut functions taken. dysfunctions lut may exacerbate symptoms, pain may interfere function lut. micturition aspects addressed. special attention paid influence micturition experience pain. primary prostate pain syndrome primary prostate pain syndrome diagnosed history pain perceived region prostate (convincingly reproduced prostate palpation), absence lut pathology, minimum three months. mentioned above, specific disease-associated pelvic pain must ruled out. thorough history important first step evaluation ppps. include type pain localisation. pain often reported pelvic areas outside prostate perineum, rectum, penis, testicles abdomen . addition, associated lut symptoms, sexual function, psychological, social economic factors addressed. determination severity disease, progression treatment response assessed means validated symptom-scoring instrument (see section 4.2.3). subjective outcome measures recommended basic evaluation therapeutic monitoring patients urological practice. primary bladder pain syndrome primary bladder pain syndrome diagnosed basis pain, pressure discomfort associated urinary bladder, accompanied least one symptom, daytime and/or night-time increased urinary frequency, exclusion confusable diseases cause symptoms, indicated, cystoscopy hydrodistension biopsy (table 4) . nature pain key disease definition: pain, pressure discomfort perceived related bladder, increasing increasing bladder content;located suprapubically, sometimes radiating groins, vagina, rectum sacrumrelieved voiding soon returns ;aggravated food drink . primary bladder pain syndrome type 3 lead small capacity fibrotic bladder without upper urinary tract outflow obstruction. 4.1.1.3. gynaecological aspects detailed medical history outlining nature, frequency site pain; relationship precipitating factors menstrual cycle, may help define aetiology. menstrual sexual history, including history sexually transmitted diseases, vaginal discharge, well previous sexual trauma mandatory well date cervical cancer screening. history obstetric and/or gynaecological surgery also warranted, particularly devices synthetic mesh used. 4.1.1.4. gastrointestinal aspects predominant symptoms patients interviewed discomfort pain relation bowel habits, daily activities, eating. precise history dysfunctional voiding defecation asked, ideally applying symptom questionnaires urinary anorectal symptoms (e.g., rome iv criteria anorectal pain). excessive straining defecations, anal digitations dyssynergic defecation, sensation anal blockage may found patients chronic anal pain. history anxiety depression impaired qol often encountered anorectal functional disorders evaluated. diagnostic criteria primary chronic anal pain syndrome (chronic proctalgia) according rome iv criteria follows must include following: chronic recurrent rectal pain aching, episodes last least thirty minutes exclusion causes rectal pain ischaemia, inflammatory bowel disease, cryptitis, intramuscular abscess fissure, haemorrhoids, prostatitis, coccyx pain syndrome. criteria fulfilled past three months symptom onset least six months diagnosis . primary chronic anal pain syndrome includes diagnostic criteria exhibits exquisite tenderness posterior traction puborectalis muscle (previously called “levator ani syndrome”). pathophysiology pain thought due over-activity pelvic floor muscles probably recto-anal incoordination. primary intermittent chronic anal pain syndrome (proctalgia fugax) consists following diagnostic criteria, fulfilled three months: recurrent episodes pain localised anus lower rectum, episodes last several seconds minutes anorectal pain episodes. stressful life events anxiety may precede onset intermittent chronic anal pain syndrome. attacks may last seconds long 30 minutes. pain may cramping, aching stabbing may become unbearable. however, patients report physicians pain attacks occur less five times year 51% patients. 4.1.1.5. peripheral nerve aspects proportion patients able relate onset pain acute event surgery, sepsis trauma, occasionally, cycling prolonged period. chronic injury frequent, associated sitting prolonged periods time. many idiopathic. pain classically perceived perineum anus clitoris/penis. however, less-specific pain distribution may occur, may due anatomical variation, involvement branches nerve rather main nerve, cns central sensitisation, consequently, involvement organs systems regional pain syndrome. nerves vicinity may also involved, example, inferior cluneal nerve perineal branches posterior femoral cutaneous nerve. musculoskeletal system may become involved, confusing pain picture aches pain developing muscles due immobility disability, possibly magnified cns changes. burning predominant adjective used describe pain. crushing electric may also used, indicating two components - constant pain often associated acute sharp episodes. many patients may feeling swelling foreign body rectum perineum, often described golf tennis ball. term pain different meanings patients would rather use term discomfort numbness. aggravating factors include type pressure applied, either directly nerve indirectly tissue, resulting pudendal traction. allodynia pain light touch due involvement cns, may make sexual contact wearing clothes difficult. patients often remain standing, consequence, develop wide range aches pains. soft seats often less well-tolerated, whereas sitting toilet seat said much better tolerated. unilateral, sitting one buttock common. pain may exacerbated bowel bladder evacuation. pudendal nerve damage may associated range sensory phenomena. distribution nerve itself, well unprovoked pain; patient may paraesthesia (pins needles); dysaesthesia (unpleasant sensory perceptions usually necessarily secondary provocation, sensation running cold water); allodynia (pain light touch); hyperalgesia (increased pain perception following painful stimulus, including hot cold stimuli). similar sensory abnormalities may found outside area innervated damaged nerve, particularly visceral striated muscle hyperalgesia. cutaneous sensory dysfunction may associated superficial dyspareunia, also irritation pain associated clothes brushing skin. may also lack sensation pain may occur presence numbness. visceral hypersensitivity may result urge defecate urinate. usually associated voiding frequency, small amounts urine passed. pain visceral filling may occur. anal pain loss motor control may result poor bowel activity, constipation and/or incontinence. ejaculation orgasm may also painful reduced. many suffering pudendal neuralgia complain fatigue generalised muscle cramps, weakness pain. unable sit major disability, time, patients struggle stand often become bedbound. immobility produces generalised muscle wasting, minimal activity hurts. consequence widespread pain disability, patients often emotional problems, particular, depression. patients chronic pelvic pain also often anxious tendency catastrophise. depression, catastrophising disability poor prognostic markers. cutaneous colour may change due changes innervation also neurogenic oedema. patient may describe area swollen due oedema, also due lack afferent perception. 4.1.1.6. myofascial aspects taking history patient pelvic pain, important address function organs pelvic area. following items certainly addressed: lower urinary tract function, anorectal function, sexual function, gynaecological items, presence pain psychosocial aspects. one cannot state pelvic floor dysfunction based history. suspicion pelvic floor muscle dysfunction two pelvic organs show dysfunction, instance combination micturition defecation problems.
