5.1. Definition and classification. Erectile dysfunction (ED) is defined as the persistent inability to attain and maintain an erection sufficient to permit satisfactory sexual performance [240]. Erectile dysfunction may affect psychosocial health and have a significant impact on the QoL of patients and their partner’s [192,241-243]. Erectile dysfunction is commonly classified into three groups based on aetiology: organic, psychogenic and mixed ED. However, this classification should be used, with caution as most cases are actually of mixed aetiology. It has therefore been suggested to use the terms “primary organic” or “primary psychogenic”.
