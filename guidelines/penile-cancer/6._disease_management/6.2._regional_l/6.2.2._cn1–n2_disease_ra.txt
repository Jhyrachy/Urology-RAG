6.2.2. cN1–N2 disease: radical inguinal lymph node dissection. 6.2.2.1. Indication for radical inguinal lymph node dissection Radical ILND remains the standard of care for patients with cN1–2. In low-volume disease (pN1) rILND is curative with a suggestion of equivalent outcomes in those patients without nodal disease [199-201]. Despite this, several studies have demonstrated continuing non-adherence to accepted international guidance [202-205]. Cindolo et al., evaluated adherence of twelve European and American centres to the EAU recommendations [205]. They reported a 26.3% rate of non-adherence in terms of LN management. For those patients managed as per guidance with LND there was a statistically significant association with OS (adjusted HR: 0.48; 95% CI: 0.24–0.96, p = 0.038) [205]. 6.2.2.2. What is an acceptable definition? Daseler’s original description of a rILND in 1948 is considered the classical description of a radical inguinal LN dissection (rILND) (see Table 6.1) [194]. Despite this, considerable variation exists across high-volume centres. In an international survey of surgeons’ practice in European high-volume centres, consensus was not found in the definition of the superior and lateral borders of the dissection, and whether the fascia lata and saphenous should be preserved [206]. This variation in practice is likely a reflection of clinicians and patients desire to reduce the significant burden of morbidity acknowledged in the literature associated with rILND (see later section on complications). A SR of the literature by the Panel identified only one other description of a modified template used in clinical N1–2 disease by Yao et al. [207] (see Table 6.1). This retrospective cohort study of 201 fascial-sparing inguinal dissections (fsILND) with < N2 disease, demonstrated comparable oncological outcomes to rILND with 3-year DFS of 92.1% (100% for pN0, 91.3% for pN1, 80% for pN2, and 33.3% for pN3 disease, respectively) and a complication rate of 29.3%. To date, however, no direct comparison exists between rILND and fsILND in this group of patients (Table 6.1).

Quality metrics To standardise the quality of resections, several studies have attempted to look for surrogate markers to infer complete oncological resection including LN yield (LNY), LN density (LNDen), and time to completion of surgery. 6.2.2.3.1. Lymph node yield and density In a SR commissioned by the Panel, several studies were identified examining the association between LNY/LNDen and survival as a surrogate marker of adequate dissection in penile cancer [203,208-212]. However, LNY varied from > 8 to > 15–16 and LND < 6.7 to < 22%. The variance in accepted values is likely because of different surgical templates, variable pathological assessment, and stage migration. Consequently, widespread adoption of LNY and LNDen as a predictor of survival and as quality markers cannot be recommended. 6.2.2.3.2. Timing of surgery Several studies have highlighted the importance of expedient LN management in patients with cN0 disease vs. surveillance with LND on presentation of clinical disease. Two non-RCTs have demonstrated a survival benefit in patients who underwent early ILND compared with delayed ILND (within six weeks of primary surgical treatment vs. surgery following identification of positive nodes during surveillance), showing 3-year CSS 84% vs. 35% (p = 0.0017) and 3-year CSS 71% vs. 50%, respectively [98,213]. The evidence in pN1–2 regarding optimal timing of LN management is limited. Chipollini et al., examined the effects of early vs. late inguinal LN dissection (> three months following primary surgery) in 84 patients with cN0 and cN+ disease. Overall, those patients undergoing early ILND demonstrated a 5-year DSS of 64.1% vs. 39.5% for late dissection with an unadjusted HR of 0.66 (0.32–1.37). However, when sub-analysis was performed in cN+ patients, the 5-year DSS for early vs. late dissections failed to delineate a statistically significant benefit (31.8% vs. 35.3%, respectively) [214]. Gulia et al., examined 28 patients undergoing rILND stratified by < 6 months (group 1) and more than 6 months (group 2) from treatment of the primary tumour (70% and 50% palpable at presentation, respectively). The 5-year CSS was 91 and 13%, respectively (p = 0.007) [215]. 6.2.2.4. Complications Radical ILND carries a significant morbidity due to impaired lymph drainage from the legs and scrotum, however it can be lifesaving and therefore should not be avoided [216]. Historical morbidity of the procedure has been as high as 61% [217]. Contemporary large series of rILND suggest between 21–55% of men will suffer a complication [115,218,219]. The reduction in morbidity is likely due to a better understanding of pre-, intra-, and post-operative management (see Table 6.2). In a SR commissioned by the Panel the most reported complications in recent series were wound infections (2–43%), skin necrosis (3–50%), lymphoedema (3.1–30%), lymphocele formation (1.8–26%), and seroma (2.4–60%)[115,199,215,218-225]. Table 6.2 lists several strategies and conditions associated with increase, decreased or uncertain effects on morbidity outcomes reported in penile cancer, urologic or in other cancers. Future studies specific to ILND and strategies to decrease morbidity are needed.

Open versus minimally-invasive approach In recognition of the significant morbidity associated with rILND, clinicians have sought to reduce these through technical modifications. Expanding interest and experience in minimally-invasive techniques have led to the introduction of video-endoscopic inguinal LND (VEIL) and subsequently robot-assisted video-endoscopic inguinal LND (RAVEIL), using rILND or fsILND templates. Ports are generally placed at the apex of the femoral triangle, although variations include lateral and hypogastric approaches allowing pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) through the same incisions [242-244]. A review of the literature commissioned by the Panel identified a single incomplete RCT in 2012 which closed prematurely due to poor accrual, with patients preferentially choosing minimally-invasive approaches over open [245]. The remaining studies identified were either retrospective cohort- or comparative series. Narrative review would suggest that although operative time is longer, LN yields can be similar to open ILND, length of hospital stay shorter in VEIL/RAVEIL and wound complications lower, though lymphocele and readmission rates were equivalent [113,236,238,246-248]. Follow-up for the minimally-invasive approaches were short, and there was a high proportion of patients receiving VEILND or RAVEIL as prophylaxis as opposed to clinically node-positive disease, precluding incorporation in the current guidance. In addition, some studies where open rILND was used as a comparator, involved more morbid manoeuvres when using an open approach, such as Sartorius transposition and saphenous vein sacrifice, which were not replicated in minimally-invasive procedures. 6.2.2.6. Summary of evidence and guidelines for radical inguinal lymph node dissection in cN1-2 disease Summary of evidenceLEOpen radical ILND is the standard for cN1–2 disease.2aRadical inguinal lymph node dissection carries a significant risk of complications (21–55%).2aA single study reported on fsILND, fascial-sparing ILND has been reported (single study) and in cN1–2 disease which appears to offer similar oncological outcomes, and reduced complications.2bLymph node yield and LND appear related to survival, however, variance in accepted values, pathological assessment, and stage migration prevent recommendation of a specific LN count.2aDelay in nodal management of more than three to six months may affect DFS.3Minimally-invasive approaches for ILND (VEIL/RAVEIL) generally have longer operative times, equivalent LN yields, shorter length of hospital stay and lower wound complications when compared with open ILND. However, since current evidence is very limited in cN1–2 patients, no recommendation for minimally-invasive approaches can be provided.2b RecommendationsStrength ratingIn patients with cN1 disease offer either ipsilateral:fascial-sparing inguinal lymph node dissection (ILND)open radical ILND; sparing the saphenous vein, if possibleStrongIn patients with cN2 disease offer ipsilateral open radical ILND; sparing the saphenous vein, if possible.StrongOffer minimally-invasive ILND to patients with cN1–2 disease only as part of a clinical trial.StrongOffer neoadjuvant chemotherapy as an alternative approach to upfront surgery to selected patients with bulky mobile inguinal nodes or bilateral disease (cN2) who are candidates for cisplatin and taxane-based chemotherapy (see Section 6.4.1).WeakComplete surgical inguinal and pelvic nodal management within three months of diagnosis (unless the patient has undergone prior neoadjuvant chemotherapy).Weak
