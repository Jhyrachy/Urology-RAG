3.1.10.3. Azathioprine. Mycophenolate is now routinely used as a primary therapy in place of azathioprine in most units worldwide. In comparison to azathioprine, mycophenolate reduced rejection rates significantly in prospective randomised trials [243,244,246,285-289]. Although a large, prospective study found that azathioprine may give acceptable results in a low-risk population [300], azathioprine is usually reserved for patients who cannot tolerate MPA [243,244,285,286,288]. When added to dual therapy with cyclosporine and steroids, a meta-analysis found no significant benefit for azathioprine with respect to major outcome parameters [301].
