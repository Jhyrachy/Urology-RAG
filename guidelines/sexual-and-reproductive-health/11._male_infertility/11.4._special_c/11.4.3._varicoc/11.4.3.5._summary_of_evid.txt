11.4.3.5. Summary of evidence and recommendations for varicocele. Summary of evidenceLEThe presence of varicocele in some men is associated with progressive testicular damage from adolescence onwards and a consequent potential reduction in fertility.2aAlthough the treatment of varicocele in adolescents may be effective, there is a significant risk of over-treatment as the majority of boys with a varicocele will have no fertility problems later in life.3Varicocele repair may be effective in men with abnormal semen parameters, a clinical varicocele and otherwise unexplained male factor infertility.1aVaricocele repair may improve pregnancy rates and sperm concentration in adult infertile men with abnormal semen analyses, while benefits in sperm motility and normal morphology are less clear.1aAlthough there are no prospective randomised studies evaluating this, meta-analyses have suggested that varicocele repair is associated with sperm appearing in the ejaculate of men with non-obstructive azoospermia.2Microscopic approach (inguinal/subinguinal) may have lower recurrence and complications rates than non-microscopic approaches (retroperitoneal and laparoscopic), although no RCTs are available yet.2aVaricocele is associated with raised sperm DNA fragmentation (SDF) and intervention has been shown to reduce SDF and may improve the outcomes from ART.2a RecommendationsStrength ratingIn adolescents offer surgery for varicocele associated with a persistent small testis (size difference of > 2 mL or 20%), which should be confirmed on two subsequent visits performed six months apart.StrongDo not treat varicocele in infertile men who have normal semen analysis and in men with a sub-clinical varicocele.StrongTreat infertile men with a clinical varicocele, abnormal semen parameters and otherwise unexplained infertility in a couple where the female partner has good ovarian reserve to improve fertility rates.StrongVaricocelectomy may be considered in men with raised DNA fragmentation with otherwise unexplained infertility or who have suffered from failed of assisted reproductive techniques, including recurrent pregnancy loss, failure of embryogenesis and implantation.Weak
