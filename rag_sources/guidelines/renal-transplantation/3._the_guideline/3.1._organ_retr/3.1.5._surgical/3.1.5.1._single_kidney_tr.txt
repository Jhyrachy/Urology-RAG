increased risk dgf (odds ratio [od] 1.46); inferior one year graft survival (od 1.62), subsequent time points . however, surgical techniques used compensate right kidney, anastomosis time surgeon experience recorded. recent registry study 87,112 deceased-donor kidney recipient pairs reported modest increase dgf (adjusted od 1.15) all-cause graft failure (adjusted hazard ratio 1.07), within first six months, associated use right kidney, association recipient mortality . furthermore, data cohort studies one registry study suggest equivalent outcomes either left right deceased donor kidneys. meta-analysis data one rct fourteen cohort studies suggested equivalent graft outcomes . overall, findings support declining organ kidney transplantation based laterality kidney offered. techniques manage short renal vein addressed donor and/or recipient. ligation internal iliac vein(s) may necessary elevate iliac vein avoid tension renal vein anastomosis . transposition iliac artery vein may enhance position venous anastomosis . right renal vein may lengthened. deceased donor kidneys usually done donor inferior vena cava (ivc) . living donors, lengthening renal vein may achieved donor gonadal vein retrieved donor nephrectomy recipient saphenous vein , although require specific consent general aforementioned techniques preferred. summary evidenceleprospective cohort studies demonstrated that:transposition recipient iliac vein appropriate technical solution compensate short length renal vein right kidney ldn (n=43);the living donor right kidney renal vein successfully lengthened using donor gonadal vein (n=17) recipient saphenous vein (n=19).3 recommendationstrength ratingassess length donor renal vein short consider one variety surgical techniques optimise venous anastomosis.weak history suggesting previous iliac femoral vein thrombosis initiate pre-operative imaging establish patency one iliac vein ivc. intra-operative finding unexpected iliac vein and/or vena cava thrombosis may lead abandonment implantation. pre-operative planning, native renal (orthotopic) superior mesenteric vein gonadal vein collaterals used. external common iliac arteries equally good arterial anastomosis. internal iliac artery frequently affected atherosclerosis external common iliac arteries. end-to-side anastomosis donor renal artery recipient external and/or common iliac artery recommended general end-to-end anastomosis internal iliac artery. rct comparing techniques suggests difference . however, study limited small numbers high (8%) overall renal artery thrombosis rate. sites vascular anastomosis chosen carefully according length renal artery vein avoid kinking vessels kidney placed final location, usually iliac fossa. site arterial anastomosis avoid atheromatous plaques iliac artery decrease risk iliac artery dissection. intima donor recipient arteries checked prior commencing arterial anastomosis ensure intimal rupture/flap. found must repaired prior to, part of, arterial anastomosis. carrel patch usually maintained deceased donor renal artery although removed either severe ostial atheroma/stenosis (with good quality proximal renal artery) length renal artery long appropriate implantation site iliac artery (which common right renal artery). multiple renal arteries supplying deceased donor kidney maintained carrel patch (of appropriate length) implanted single anastomosis. living donor transplantation, multiple renal arteries require variety strategies achieve optimum re-perfusion . two arteries implanted separately achieve single anastomosis: small second artery (especially supplying upper pole) may sacrificed;
