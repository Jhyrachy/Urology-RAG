3.3.5.4. Patients with identified risk-factors. 3.3.5.4.1. Diabetes mellitus Diabetes mellitus, even when well regulated, is reported to correlate to a higher frequency of ABU [67]. One RCT demonstrated that eradicating ABU did not reduce the risk of symptomatic UTI and infectious complications in patients with diabetes mellitus. The time to first symptomatic episode was also similar in both groups. Furthermore, untreated ABU did not correlate to diabetic nephropathy [68]. Screening and treatment of ABU in well-controlled diabetes mellitus is therefore not recommended. However, poorly regulated diabetes is a risk factor for symptomatic UTI and infectious complications. 3.3.5.4.2. ABU in post-menopausal women Elderly women have an increased incidence of ABU [69]. Four RCTs compared antibiotic treatment of ABU with placebo controls or no treatment, in a post-menopausal female population, with different antibiotic doses and regimens [70-73]. Women in these studies were mostly nursing home residents, which may bias the results of this analysis. Three RCTs reported on the rate of symptomatic UTIs (average RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.05; 208 women) and the resolution of bacteriuria (average RR 1.28, 95% CI 0.50 to 3.24; 203 women) [54,63,64], with no significant benefit of antibiotic treatment. Therefore, ABU in post-menopausal women does not require treatment, and should be managed as for pre-menopausal women. 3.3.5.4.3. Elderly institutionalised patients The rate of ABU is 15-50% in elderly institutionalised patients [74]. Differential diagnosis of ABU from symptomatic UTI is difficult in the multi-diseased and mentally deteriorated patients, and is probably a cause of unnecessary antibiotic treatment [75,76]. Seven RCTs compared antibiotic treatment of ABU with placebo controls or no treatment in elderly patients, with different antibiotic doses and regimens [70-73,77-79]. Three RCTs reported on the rate of symptomatic UTIs [70,72,77]. Antibiotic treatment was not significantly beneficial in reducing the rate of symptomatic UTIs compared to placebo or no treatment (average RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.00; n=210). Six RCTs reported on the resolution of bacteriuria [70,72,73,77-79]. There was no benefit of antibiotic treatment compared to placebo in the resolution of ABU (average RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.63 to 2.79; n=328). One RCT compared the rates of incontinence in this patient group before and after the eradication of ABU and found no effect of antibiotic treatment [80]. A subsequent systematic review and meta-analysis of nine RCTs found that antibiotic treatment of ABU in this group was associated with significantly more adverse effects with no clinical benefit [81]. Therefore, screening and treatment of ABU is not recommended in this patient group. 3.3.5.4.4. Patients with renal transplants Two RCTs and two retrospective studies compared the effect of antibiotic treatment to no treatment in renal transplant patients [82-85]. Meta-analysis of the two RCTs did not find antibiotic treatment beneficial in terms of reducing symptomatic UTIs between 12 and 22 months after renal transplantation (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.45; n=200). The two retrospective studies reached the same conclusion. Furthermore, there were no significant differences in the rate of ABU clearance, graft loss or change in renal function during long-term follow-up to 24 months [82-85]. A further two RCTs [86,87], one observational study [88] and two systematic reviews and meta-analyses [89,90] were identified. The first RCT reported that during the first 2 months following renal transplantation the incidence of and risk for UTIs (25% vs. 10%, HR 2.8, 95% CI 0.8-9.1, p=0.07) and pyelonephritis (15% vs. 2.5%, HR 6.5, 95% CI 0.8-54.7, p=0.08) was higher in patients receiving antibiotic treatment for ABU vs. no treatment [86]. In the second RCT no difference in acute graft pyelonephritis was found between the treatment and no treatment group (12.2% vs 8.7%, RR 1.40, 95% CI 0.40-4.87) in the first year after renal transplantation; however, rates of antimicrobial resistance were higher in the treatment group [87]. The first of the two additional meta-analyses reported the same results as the original study [89]. The second meta-analysis of n=1,353 patients reported ABU incidence rates of 22% in the first month and 32% during the first year after renal transplantation [90]. The analysis did not find a correlation between ABU and acute graft pyelonephritis (OR 1.8, 95% CI 0.78-1.79), a benefit of ABU antibiotic treatment on the risk of UTI (OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.63-1.84) or a change of renal function (mean difference in serum creatinine concentration - 0.03 mg/dL [95% CI 0.15-0.10]) [90]. Therefore, treatment of ABU is not recommended in renal transplant recipients. 3.3.5.4.5. Patients with dysfunctional and/or reconstructed lower urinary tracts Patients with lower urinary tract dysfunction (LUTD) (e.g., neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction (NLUTD) secondary to multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury patients, patients with incomplete bladder emptying, patients using clean intermittent catheterisation [CIC], or patients with reconstructed lower urinary tract including ileal conduits, orthotopic bladder replacement or continent reservoirs frequently become colonised [91,92]. A systematic review reported ABU prevalence rates ranging from 25-86% for intestinal conduits in 4 studies and 9.1-85% for orthotopic neobladders in 9 studies [93]. Studies have shown no long-term benefit in ABU treatment in these patient groups [84,85,93]. Furthermore, in LUTD patients who do not spontaneously develop ABU, deliberate colonisation with an ABU strain (Escherichia coli 83972) has shown a protective effect against symptomatic recurrences [94,95]. Screening and treatment of ABU in these patient groups is therefore, not recommended. If these patient groups develop recurrent symptomatic UTI (see section 3.5) the potential protective effect of a spontaneously developed ABU against UTI must be considered before any treatment. 3.3.5.4.6. Patients with catheters in the urinary tract Patients with indwelling or suprapubic catheters and nephrostomy tubes invariably become carriers of ABU, with antibiotic treatment showing no benefit [96]. This is also applicable for patients with ABU and indwelling ureteral stents [97]. Routine treatment of catheter-associated bacteriuria is not recommended. For detailed recommendations see section 3.8. 3.3.5.4.7. Patients with ABU subjected to catheter placements/exchanges In patients subjected to uncomplicated placement/exchanges of indwelling urethral catheters ABU is not considered a risk factor and should not be screened or treated [98]. In patients subjected to placement/exchanges of nephrostomy tubes and indwelling ureteral stents, ABU is considered a risk factor for infectious complications [99]. 3.3.5.4.8. Immuno-compromised and severely diseased patients, patients with candiduria These patient groups have to be considered individually and the benefit of screening and treatment of ABU should be reviewed in each case. Patients with asymptomatic candiduria may, although not necessarily, have an underlying disorder or defect. Treatment of asymptomatic candiduria is not recommended [100].
