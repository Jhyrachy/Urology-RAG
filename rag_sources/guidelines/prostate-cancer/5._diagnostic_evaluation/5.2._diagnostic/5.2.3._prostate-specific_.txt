5.2.3. prostate-specific antigen density. prostate-specific antigen density (psa-d) level serum psa divided prostate volume. higher psa-d, likely pca clinically significant; particular smaller prostates psa-d cut-off 0.15 ng/ml/cc applied . several studies found psa-d 0.1â€“0.15 ng/ml/cc predictive pca . patients psa-d 0.09 ng/ml/cc found unlikely (4%) diagnosed cspca . psa-d one strongest predictors risk calculators. psa-d remains currently limited due lack standardisation prostate volume estimation assessed dre imaging (trus mri using various techniques ellipsoid formula planimetry). nonetheless, one study involving seven radiologists assessed prostate volume 40 mri scans using two different ellipsoid methods manual planimetry method suggested intra inter-reader reproducibility three methods excellent intraclass correlation coefficient > 0.90 . series 640 men, trus found prostate volumes average 8% smaller mri; 109 men underwent rp, mri-derived prostate volume better correlated volume surgical specimen trus-derived volume . transabdominal ultrasound overestimated prostate volume 9.9 ml . therefore, use transabdominal ultrasound evaluate prostate volume discouraged.
