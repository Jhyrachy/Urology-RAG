8.4. Follow-up of functional outcomes and complications. Apart from oncological surveillance, patients with a urinary diversion need functional follow-up. Complications related to urinary diversion are detected in 45% of patients during the first five years of follow-up. In a series of 131 patients, this rate increased to 94% in those surviving > 15 years [592]. General functional complications are diverse and include: vitamin B12 deficiency, metabolic acidosis, worsening of renal function, urinary infections, urolithiasis and ureteroenteric stricture [593]. Benign ureteroenteric strictures may occur in up to 20% of patients [593]. Based on SEER data, cystectomy was found to be associated with a 21% increased risk of fractures compared to no RC due to chronic metabolic acidosis and subsequent long-term bone loss [591]. Since low vitamin B12 levels have been reported in 17% of patients with bowel diversion, in case of cystectomy and bowel diversion, vitamin B12 levels should be measured annually [81,82,594]. In a series of 3,360 patients who underwent RC for MIBC, 29% progressed to advanced chronic kidney disease within 12 months [595]. In a retrospective study comparing various forms of intestinal diversion, ileal conduits had fewer late complications than continent abdominal pouches or orthotopic neobladders [594]. The main long- term complications in ileal conduit patients are stomal complications in up to 24% and functional and/or morphological changes of the UUT in up to 30% of patients [594,596,597]. At 15 years of follow-up, 50% of patients developed UUT changes and 38% developed urolithiasis [598]. The main specific complications in patients with a neobladder are continence problems and emptying dysfunction [576]. Clifford et al., prospectively evaluated continence outcomes in male patients undergoing orthotopic neobladder diversion [599]. Day-time continence increased from 59% at less than three months post-operatively to 92% after 12 to 18 months. Night-time continence increased from 28% at less than three months post-operatively to 51% after 18 to 36 months. Also of interest is the urinary bother in females with an orthotopic neobladder. Bartsch and co-workers reported day-time and night-time continence rates of 70.4% and 64.8%, respectively, in 56 female neobladder patients. Emptying disfunction is especially common in women: approximately two-thirds need to catheterise their neobladder, while almost 45% do not void spontaneously at all [600]. There seems to be a correlation between voiding patterns and nerve preservation; in 66 women bilateral preservation of autonomic nerves decreased the need for catheterisation to between 3.4–18.7% (CI: 95%) [601]. In a single-centre series of 259 male patients, long-term follow-up after orthotopic bladder substitution (median 121 months [range 60–267]), showed that excellent long-term functional outcomes can be achieved in high-volume centres with dedicated teams [602].
