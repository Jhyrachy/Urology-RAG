4.5. Urinalysis. Urinalysis (dipstick or microscopy) must be included in the primary evaluation of any patient presenting with LUTS to identify conditions, such as urinary tract infections (UTI), microhaematuria and diabetes mellitus. If abnormal findings are detected, further tests are recommended according to other EAU Guidelines, e.g., Guidelines on urinary tract cancers and urological infections [48-51]. Urinalysis is recommended in most Guidelines in the primary management of patients with LUTS [52,53]. There is limited evidence, but general expert consensus suggests that the benefits outweigh the costs [54]. The value of urinary dipstick/microscopy for diagnosing UTI in men with LUTS without acute frequency and dysuria has been questioned [55]. Summary of evidenceLEUrinalysis (dipstick or microscopy) may indicate a UTI, proteinuria, haematuria, or glycosuria requiring further assessment.3The benefits of urinalysis outweigh the costs.4 RecommendationStrength ratingUse urinalysis (by dipstick or microscopy) in the assessment of male LUTS.Strong
