6.1.1. treatment superficial non-invasive disease (pein, ta). penile intra-epithelial neoplasia progress invasive lesions 2.6–13% patients, despite treatment; hence, definitive eradication diligent follow-up monitoring important [127-129]. pein lesions located mucosal surfaces glans prepuce whilst lichen sclerosus also affects prepuce . thus, circumcision primary surgical option . following circumcision, glans mucosa keratinizes period 3–6 months residual pein lichen sclerosus may resolve. close monitoring starting additional therapy advocated, date, data supporting concept limited . considering median time progression malignancy thirteen months , approach seems reasonable test future clinical trials. 6.1.1.1. topical therapies topical therapy imiquimod (iq) 5-fluorouracil (5-fu) effective non-invasive first-line treatment options use increasingly reported . 5-fluorouracil exerts effects inhibition enzyme thymidylate synthase. although standard protocol exists, leaving 5-fu ointment 12 hours every 48 hours 4 6-week treatment course often recommended reported series pein therapy . imiquimod acts several pathways including activation immune cells via toll-like receptor 7, creating inflammatory response, commonly used 3 times per week 12 weeks. consensus comparative data optimal treatment schedules therapies evidence treatments heterogenous relies retrospective studies. sr based aforementioned low-quality data illustrated topical agents showed response- recurrence rates 40–100% 20% iq, vs. 48–74% 11% 5-fu, respectively . use 5-fu typically results marked erythema, erosions, crust lasting month longer, decreased patient compliance treatment regimens may result diminished effectiveness. similarly, iq use complicated resultant tissue effects, including erythema, oedema erosions, ulceration crust, consistent one individual next . discontinuation topical agents side effects observed 12% cases . advised treatment effects must clinically assessed cases doubt evaluated biopsy long-term surveillance warranted. insufficient responses recurrences may signify underlying invasive disease, hence, topical treatment fails, repeated. 6.1.1.2. laser ablation laser ablation alternative treatment option. energy-based therapies discussed literature include neodymium:yttrium-aluminium-garnet (nd:yag, penetration 4–61398042195mm, wavelength 1064 nm) carbon dioxide (co2, penetration < 1 mm, wavelength 10600 nm) lasers photodynamic therapy . laser treatment shown total response rates 52–100% recurrence reported 7–48% patients . altered penile sensitivity following laser treatment described, including increased sensitivity 50% decreased sensitivity 15% patients. reports show relatively high rates local recurrence, possibly owing inadequate penetration, difficulties assessing borders affected areas missing lesions invaded subepithelial tissue . repeat laser treatment recurrence described series without compromising long-term oncological outcomes, likely result low risk lesions treated series . cryotherapy, without topical therapy, photodynamic therapy, induces photo-selective cell death, limited data treatment pein. 6.1.1.3. surgery extensive pein, residual pein resection margins recurrent disease ablative topical therapy, treated surgical excision. glans resurfacing consists full thickness removal glandular epithelium followed reconstruction graft (split skin buccal mucosa urethral reconstruction ). grafts tend excellent engraftment rates well-vascularized wound bed . recurrences reported low (0–20%) cosmesis acceptable . feasible, preservation coronal ridge helps maintain sexual function provides excellent cosmetic outcomes shown small retrospective report . resection, opposed ablative topical treatments, provides advantage complete histopathological local staging detection areas invasion; one study cases glans resurfacing presumed pein, 20% patients found invasive disease histopathological examination . surgeons pathologists urged discuss appropriate specimen handling (e.g., pinning skin resected) pathological reporting cases aid management avoid over-reporting positive margins .
