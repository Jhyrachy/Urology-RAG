9.4. Tissue engineered grafts. 9.4.1. Cell-free tissue engineered grafts These grafts are derived from cadaveric or animal sources (e.g., porcine small intestine submucosa [SIS], acellular bladder matrix, acellular dermal matrix), are completely cell-free and serve as a scaffold for host cell ingrowth [530]. The main advantage suggested for their use is the off-shelf availability [530]. A small RCT (n=30) comparing acellular bladder matrix with BMG reported a urethral patency rate of respectively 66.6% and 100%. The poorer results of acellular bladder matrix were the most apparent in cases of an unhealthy urethral bed [531]. Several small retrospective case series using mainly porcine small intestinal submucosa, demonstrate varying patency rates from 20-110%. The patient groups were heterogenious in terms of aetiology, previous treatment, urethral location and definition of success rate. An overview can be found in Table 9.3. Most papers report a poorer outcome in case of extensive spongiofibrosis, poor vascular graft bed, previous treatments and longer strictures [531-535] (Table 9.3).

Autologous tissue engineered oral mucosa graftss These grafts contain a matrix seeded with autologous oral mucosa cells. Production requires a small oral mucosa biopsy (at 0.5 cmÂ²) and the graft is further manufactured in the lab. The main advantage suggested is the reduction of oral donor site morbidity whereas the main disadvantages are costs and the strict time frame between manufacturing and implantation of the graft [530]. The clinical use of autologous tissue-engineered OMG was evaluated in a prospective, multicentre study including 99 patients [536]. Estimated twelve- and 24-months urethral patency rate was 67.3 and 58.2%, respectively. Oral adverse events were minimal. No comparative studies with acellular grafts or native OMGs are available nor are there any data about the cost-effectiveness [530]. Summary of evidenceLESafety, patency rate and cost-effectiveness of autologous tissue-engineered grafts is currently under research.3 RecommendationStrength ratingDo not use autologous tissue-engineered oral mucosa grafts outside the frame of a clinical trial.Strong
