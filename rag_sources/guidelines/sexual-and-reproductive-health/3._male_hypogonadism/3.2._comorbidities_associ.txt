3.2. comorbidities associated male hypogonadism. 3.2.1. obesity low testosterone levels common men obesity. male hypogonadism associated greater percentage fat mass lower lean mass compared men adequate testosterone levels . low levels testosterone strongly linked heightened visceral adiposity. additionally, result lipid accumulation liver muscle, correlating atherosclerosis . 3.2.2. metabolic syndrome/type 2 diabetes hypogonadism frequently associated mets related components, including central obesity, hyperglycaemia, insulin resistance dyslipidaemia arterial hypertension . several randomised controlled trials (rcts) demonstrated testosterone therapy may improve insulin resistance hyperglycaemia lower total low-density protein (ldl) cholesterol [28-33]. testosterone therapy hypogonadal t2dm improved glycaemic control rcts registry trials; however, conclusive evidence . large placebo-controlled rct, including 1,007 patients impaired glucose tolerance newly-diagnosed t2dm total testosterone < 14 nmol/l showed testosterone therapy two years reduced proportion patients t2dm regardless lifestyle programme . similarly, registry study reported testosterone therapy associated time remission t2dm . high-density lipoprotein (hdl)-cholesterol may decrease, remain unchanged increase testosterone therapy. testosterone therapy men mets low testosterone shown reduce mortality compared untreated men , although conclusive evidence available. erectile dysfunction (ed) common men mets t2dm (up 70% patients). causes ed multi-factorial 30% men ed co-existing testosterone-deficiency/hypogonadism. evidence suggested ed found men t2dm clearly reduced testosterone levels(< 8 nmol/l 2.31 ng/ml) . pathophysiological perspective, reported ed predominantly caused vascular neuropathic disease, therefore likely men established vascular disease. therefore, men presenting ed screened mets. likewise, patients ed diabetes may offered testosterone measurement. placebo-controlled rcts testosterone therapy t2dm demonstrated improved sexual desire satisfaction, although data erectile function limited . similar results derived meta-analysis published trials . accordingly, large two-year rct testosterone undecanoate vs. placebo showed testosterone therapy significantly improved sexual function ed men impaired glucose tolerance newly-diagnosed t2dm low testosterone (< 14 nmol/l) . testosterone therapy associated reduced percentage body fat increase lean body mass . data registry study suggested testosterone therapy long-acting intramuscular testosterone undecanoate eleven years associated substantial gradual loss weight, along reduction waist circumference 3.2.3. sars-cov-2 / covid-19 data seem suggest low circulating testosterone levels frequently associated worse clinical outcomes men covid-19 [42-49]. accordingly, cohort study, analysing two large academic health systems databases, including 723 men history covid-19 reported hypogonadal men higher risk hospitalised . addition, meta-analysis suggested reduced testosterone levels detected hospital admission covid-19 associated four- five-fold increased risk admitted intensive care unit (icu) dying, adjustment potential confounders . although information role testosterone therapy acute phase disease available currently, data also showed hypogonadal patients testosterone therapy reduced risk hospitalised sars-cov-2 infection . however, whether low testosterone directly contribute worse covid-19 outcomes still investigation. possibility low testosterone acute phase covid-19 infection represents adaptive response mechanism dampen non-essential activities non conducive recovery (physical sexual activities) turning testosterone-dependent functions, cannot excluded . accordingly, meta-analysis showed secondary mixed hypogonadism frequently observed acute phase infection . studies evaluating patients recovery phase covid-19 documented either restored persistently low testosterone levels majority cases . longitudinal evaluation study showed recovery phase improvement testosterone levels observed twelve months covid-19. male subjects recovered covid-19 accurately followed-up exclude long-term andrological consequences including impairment sperm testosterone production . table 2: main factors associated increase reduction shbg circulating levels shbg increaseshbg decreasedrugs: anticonvulsants, oestrogens, thyroid hormonehyperthyroidismhepatic diseaseageingsmokingaids/hivdrugs: growth hormone (gh), glucocorticoids, testosterone, anabolic androgenic steroidshypothyroidismobesityacromegalycushingâ€™s diseaseinsulin resistance (mets/t2dm)non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (nafld),nephrotic syndrome
