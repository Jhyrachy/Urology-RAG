6.2.1. Clinical stage I with (persistently) elevated serum tumour markers. With elevated markers and CS I, weekly measurement of markers are recommended. If AFP or β-hCG increase or fail to normalise following orchidectomy, US examination of the contralateral testicle must be performed. If a contralateral tumour is excluded, unequivocal rising tumour markers indicates CS I, and treatment for good prognosis metastatic GCT should be given. With stable markers, a new staging procedure, 4-6 weeks after orchidectomy, is recommended. Some patients may have stable but slightly elevated AFP or β-hCG and can be initially monitored. Treatment should be commenced if markers rise or when follow-up imaging demonstrates metastatic disease. The treatment of true CS I SGCT should be the same as other metastatic GCT. With this, ten-year overall survival of 95%, have been reported [150,151].
