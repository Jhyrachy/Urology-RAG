7.1. Definition, classification and epidemiology. It has always been a challenge to define sexual desire properly because it has a complicated nature and it can be conceptualised in many different ways. According to the International Classification of Diseases 10th edition (ICD-10), lack or loss of sexual desire should be the principal problem and not other sexual problems accompanying it such as ED [815]. In the DSM-V, male hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) is defined as “the persistent or recurrent deficiency (or absence) of sexual or erotic thoughts or fantasies and desire for sexual activity”. The clinician makes the judgment of deficiency, taking into account factors that affect sexual functioning, such as age and general and socio-cultural contexts of the individual’s life [207]. According to the fourth International Consultation on Sexual Medicine (ICSM), the definition of male HSDD was proposed as a “persistent or recurrent deficiency or absence of sexual or erotic thoughts or fantasies and desire for sexual activity (clinical principle)” [816]. Although the exact prevalence of low sexual desire (LSD) is unknown, a prevalence of 4.7% was reported in a survey of a population-based sample of middle-aged German men (n = 12,646) [817].
