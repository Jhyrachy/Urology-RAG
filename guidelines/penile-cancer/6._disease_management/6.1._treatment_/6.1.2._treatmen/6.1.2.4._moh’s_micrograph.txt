6.1.2.4. Moh’s micrographic surgery. Moh’s micrographic surgery is a surgical technique by which tissue is excised and processed with en face histological margins in real time to give a complete circumferential and deep margin. It aims at maximal organ-preservation by adopting margin-guided excision. Three studies reported the 5-year RFR in 51 men, most with T1 disease. Recurrence-free rates ranged from 71.4 to 100% with a cumulative mean 5-year RFR of 88.2% (45/51) [3]. As data are very limited, it is not routinely recommended, and the Panel feels it is important to involve a clinician experienced in penile cancer management before referral for Moh’s surgery.
