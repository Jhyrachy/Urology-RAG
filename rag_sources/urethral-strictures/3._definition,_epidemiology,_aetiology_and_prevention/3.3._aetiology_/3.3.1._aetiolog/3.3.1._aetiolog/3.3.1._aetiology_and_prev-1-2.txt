ies represent “real world” data, including levels surgical experience surgical volumes whereas meta-analysis based clinical studies. thus, better outcomes robotic rp population studies may related shorter learning curve . d.3.1 risk factors development vesicourethral anastomosis strictures include higher grade cancer, advanced stage, higher prostate volume, coronary artery disease, obesity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, previous bladder outlet surgery older age . surgical factors include use non-nerve-sparing technique, anastomotic urine leak, increased operative time increased estimated blood loss . addition, low-volume surgeons (< 40/year) shown higher vuas rates, 27.7%, compared high-volume surgeons (> 40/year), 22% . d.3.2 interventions prevent vesicourethral anastomosis strictures srougi et al., studied bladder neck mucosal eversion prospective rct 95 patients. significant difference found rates vuas twelve months follow-up . meta-analysis kowelewski et al., comparing interrupted vs. continuous vesico-urethral anastomosis suturing found difference vuas rates . another sr bai et al., compared barbed sutures conventional sutures, although heterogeneity across studies precluded meta-analysis, patients developed vuas either approach . d.4 prostate radiation ablative treatments urethral strictures occur 1.5% patients undergoing external beam radiation therapy (ebrt), 1.9% brachytherapy (bt) 4.9% receive combination ebrt-bt around four years follow-up . strictures typically occur bulbomembranous urethra . opposed rp, stricture incidence irradiation increases time . ablative treatments, stricture incidence cryotherapy high-intensity focused ultrasound (hifu) 1.1-3.3% 10.3%, respectively . use modalities salvage setting associated increased risk stricture formation: 3-10% salvage ebrt, 5-12% salvage cryotherapy 15-30% salvage hifu . due increasing utilisation prostate irradiation (ebrt, bt) ablative treatments (cryotherapy, hifu), increasing number respectively radiation-induced ablative treatment-induced strictures expected . d.4.1 risk factors development radiation strictures awad et al., performed multivariate meta-regression analysis including 46 studies, finding combining erbt + bt length follow-up significant predictors urethral stricture following prostate radiation . factors shown predict urethral stricture included biochemical equivalent dose, age, androgen deprivation therapy . previous turp included analysis, found independent predictor stricture (hr: 2.81) previous multivariate analysis single institution well psa level < 10 ng/ml (hr: 0.47) . d.4.2 interventions prevent radiation induced urethral strictures delaying adjuvant salvage ebrt nine months associated lower rates urethral stricture (hr: 0.6) . balanced risk delaying treatment terms cancer control . bt, reported downward movement needle applicators occurs fractions . may explain strictures occur prostatic apex called “hot spot” . several measures taken together thought contributed reduction urethral stricture formation bt including reduction dose “hot spot”, careful needle placement, avoiding midline insertion introduction plastic needles rather steel . e. failed hypospadias repair although urethral strictures hypospadias repair sometimes considered iatrogenic , specific subtype considered separate entity. main reasons absence spongiosus tissue different levels within penile urethral segment, lack high-quality local tissues urethral reconstruction . f. congenital diagnosis congenital urethral stricture made absence possible aetiology, iatrogenic, inflammatory, traumatic causes . congenital strictures thought consequent incomplete incorrect fusion urethra formed urogenital sinus urethra formed following closure urethral folds. typically deep bulbar location usually short. general, congenital strictures diagnosed young age (moorman’s ring cobb’s collar). g. idiopathic idiopathic strictures seen 34% penile strictures 63% bulbar strictures . unrecognised trauma thought possible aetiology idiopathic urethral strictures .
