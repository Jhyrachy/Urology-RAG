7.3. Active Surveillance. With recurrence in LG(G1) Ta tumours being more likely low grade and non-invasive [249-251] the risk of progression to a higher grade or stage is infrequent to rare [252-254]. Expectant management or active surveillance (AS), offer an alternative to TURB and office-based fulguration. Observing no progression to MIBC, Soloway et al., first recommended this approach in 2003 [255] and Miyake et al., subsequently proposed an algorithm for AS using changes in size and multifocality as triggers for intervention [256]. However, from a review undertaken by the EAU Young Academic Urology group [257], it appears that the level of evidence in favour of AS is low, with observational studies having heterogenous selection criteria, triggers for intervention and surveillance tools. The multicentre prospective Bladder Cancer Italian Active Surveillance (BIAS) project, conversely, demonstrated that AS is feasible in selected patients [258,259] and its success be predicted by prognostic variables associated to TaLG disease [260]. However, additional evidence from quality clinical trials is required.
