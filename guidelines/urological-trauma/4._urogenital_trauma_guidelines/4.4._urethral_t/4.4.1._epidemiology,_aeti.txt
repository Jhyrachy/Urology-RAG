4.4.1. Epidemiology, aetiology and pathophysiology. 4.4.1.1. Anterior male urethral injury The bulbar urethra is the most common site affected by blunt trauma. In bulbar injuries, the bulb is compressed against the pubic symphysis, resulting in rupture of the urethra at the site of compression [239]. Possible mechanisms are straddle injuries or kicks to the perineum. A penile fracture can be complicated by a urethral injury in approximately 15% of cases [240,241]. Penetrating anterior injuries are rare and are usually caused by gunshot wounds, stab wounds, dog bites, impalement, or penile amputations [239]. Depending on the affected segment, penetrating injuries are usually associated with penile, testicular and/or pelvic injuries [242]. Insertion of foreign bodies is another rare cause of anterior injury. It is usually a result of autoerotic stimulation or may be associated with psychiatric disorders [243]. Iatrogenic injury is the most common type of urethral trauma [244]. The incidence of male urethral injury during transurethral catheterisation is 13.4 per 1,000 catheters inserted [245]. Injuries can occur due to creation of a false passage by the tip of the catheter or inadvertent inflation of the anchoring balloon in the urethra [245]. The importance of catheter insertion training programmes [246,247] and the implementation of difficult urinary catheterisation protocols [248], to prevent urethral injury during transurethral catheterisation, have been demonstrated. Preliminary data suggests that guidewire led catheter insertion, or use of a safety valve for balloon inflation may prevent urethral trauma in difficult catheterisation cases [249,250]. A SR of the use of hydrophilic coated catheters, in patients performing intermittent catheterization, showed no clear benefit [251]. During penile prosthesis insertion, the risk of urethral perforation is 0.1-4%. Proximal urethral injuries are more common than distal ones [252]. 4.4.1.2. Posterior male urethral injuries Blunt posterior urethral injuries are almost exclusively related to pelvic fractures and the risk increases with fracture configuration severity [253]. These injuries are referred to as pelvic fracture urethral injuries (PFUI) [239], and are mainly caused by road traffic accidents [254]. Pelvic fracture urethral injuries are divided into partial or complete ruptures [253,254]. In complete ruptures, there is a gap between the disrupted ends of the urethra, which fills up with scar tissue. There is no urethral wall in the scarred space and any lumen represents a fistulous tract between the urethral stumps [255]. Injuries of the bladder neck and prostate are rare and mostly occur at the anterior midline of both the bladder neck and prostatic urethra [256]. It is highly uncommon to find a complete transection of the bladder neck or an avulsion of the anterior part of the prostate [256]. Concomitant injuries to the head, thorax, abdomen and/or spine are frequent (up to 66%) [254]. Penetrating injuries of the pelvis, perineum, or buttocks (mainly gunshot wounds) can also damage the posterior urethra but are extremely rare in the civilian setting [253]. There is a high probability of associated injuries (approx. 90%), mainly intra-abdominal [192]. The associated injuries which occur with both blunt and penetrating posterior urethral injuries can be life-threatening, and if so, will govern the patient’s assessment and treatment [254]. Delayed morbidities of posterior urethral injuries include strictures, incontinence and erectile dysfunction, all of which may have a detrimental effect on the patient’s quality of life [257]. The pooled estimate for the proportion of patients with erectile dysfunction following PIFU is 34% [258]. Iatrogenic injury has been reported with transanal total mesorectal excision in 1-11% of cases. This injury is usually partial and located at the membranous urethra [259]. 4.4.1.3. Female urethral injuries Birth related injuries to the female urethra are rare and consist of minor (peri)urethral lacerations during vaginal delivery. Pelvic fractures are the main cause of blunt trauma [260]; however, PFUIs in females are rare and less common than in males [253]. This is usually attributed to the flexibility provided by the vagina and the greater inherent elasticity of the female urethra [260], it may also be the result of less severe and more frequent stable pelvic fractures in females [184,254]. In unstable pelvic fractures in females, a high suspicion for a urethral injury should be maintained [260]. Female urethral injuries are classified into two types: longitudinal or partial (most frequent) injuries and transverse or complete injuries [260]. Concomitant bladder or vaginal injury is possible; therefore, females are at risk of developing urinary incontinence and urethrovaginal fistula [254,260]. Insertion of a synthetic sub-urethral sling for the treatment of female stress urinary incontinence is complicated by an intra-operative urethral injury in 0.2-2.5% of cases [261] and is an important cause of iatrogenic urethral injury.
