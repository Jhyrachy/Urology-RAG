6.6.2. Prognostic factors. Median survival of patients with newly diagnosed metastases (synchronous mHSPC) is approximately 50 months with ADT alone, however, it is highly variable since the M1 population is heterogeneous [1084]. Several prognostic factors for survival have been suggested including the number and location of bone metastases, presence of visceral metastases, ISUP grade group, PS status and initial PSA and alkaline phosphatase level, but only few have been validated [1085-1088]. ‘Volume‘ of disease as a potential predictor was introduced by CHAARTED (Chemo-hormonal Therapy versus Androgen Ablation Randomised Trial for Extensive Disease in Prostate Cancer) [1088-1090] (see table 6.4.1) and subsequently, in STAMPEDE, was shown to be predictive in an adequately powered subgroup analysis for benefit of addition of prostate RT to ADT in the subgroup of patients with low volume/burden disease [1091] (See table 6.4.1). ‘Metachronous’ metastatic disease (after radical local treament of the primary tumour) vs. synchronous (or de novo) metastatic disease has also been shown to have generally a better prognosis [1092]. Based on a large SWOG 9346 cohort, the PSA level after seven months of ADT was used to create three prognostic groups (see Table 6.4.2) [1093]. A PSA ≤ 0.2 ng/mL at seven months has been confirmed as a prognostic marker for men receiving ADT for metastatic disease in the CHAARTED study independent of the addition of docetaxel [1094]. Similarly reaching PSA levels of ≤ 0.1ng/ml after six months were shown to be correlated with long-term outcomes in the LATITUDE study [1095]. Also for patients treated with ADT and apalutamide a deep PSA decline defined by ≥ 90% from baseline or to PSA≤ 0.2 ng/ml at a landmark of three months was associated with longer OS [1096] for patients.
