5.7.6. Follow-up. The natural history and clinical evolution at long-term follow-up of men with UAB is not well documented. A small retrospective cohort evaluated recovery of detrusor contraction one year after (medical or surgical) treatment through video-urodynamic studies [789]. In this small cohort, bladder contractility recovery was seen in 43.9% of patients and an optimal bladder compliance cut-off value of < 80ml/cmH2O was predictive of better recovery. The interval between follow-up visits depends on patient characteristics, treatments given and the frequency of urinary complications. Two studies looked at the natural evolution of detrusor contractility with or without TURP for BOO [108,750]. Although retrospective, they showed that detrusor contractility does not get worse with persisting BOO nor that it improves after performing a TURP. The underactive detrusor seems to remain under-active but does not deteriorate with time.
