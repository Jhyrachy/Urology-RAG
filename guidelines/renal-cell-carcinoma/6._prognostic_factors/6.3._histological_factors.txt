6.3. Histological factors. Histological factors include tumour grade, RCC subtype, lymphovascular invasion, tumour necrosis, and invasion of the collecting system [184,185]. Tumour grade is considered one of the most important histological prognostic factors. Fuhrman nuclear grade [186] has now been replaced by the WHO/ISUP grading classification [187]. This relies solely on nucleolar prominence for grade 1-3 tumours, allowing for less inter-observer variation [188]. It has been shown that the WHO/ISUP grading provides superior prognostic information compared to Fuhrman grading, especially for grade 2 and grade 3 tumours [189]. Rhabdoid and sarcomatoid changes can be found in all RCC types and are equivalent to grade 4 tumours. Sarcomatoid changes are more often found in chRCC than other subtypes [190]. The percentage of the sarcomatoid component appears to be prognostic as well, with a larger percentage of involvement being associated with worse survival. There is no agreement on the optimal prognostic cut-off for sub-classifying sarcomatoid changes [191,192], although 20% has been suggested to distinguish focal and extensive amount of sarcomatoid features [193]. The WHO/ISUP grading system is applicable to both ccRCC and pRCC. It is currently not recommended to grade chRCC. However, a recent study suggested a two-tiered chRCC grading system (low vs. high grade) based on the presence of sarcomatoid differentiation and/or tumour necrosis, which was statistically significant on multivariable analysis [194]. Both the WHO/ISUP and chRCC grading systems need to be validated for prognostic systems and nomograms [187]. Renal cell carcinoma subtype is regarded as another important prognostic factor. On univariable analysis, patients with chRCC vs. pRCC vs. ccRCC had a better prognosis [195,196] (Table 6.1). However, prognostic information provided by the RCC type is lost when stratified according to tumour stage [196,197] (LE: 3). In a recent cohort study of 1,943 patients with ccRCC and pRCC significant survival differences were only shown between pRCC type I and ccRCC [198]. Papillary RCC has been traditionally divided into type 1 and 2, but a subset of tumours shows mixed features. For more details, see Section 3.2 – Histological diagnosis. Data also suggest that type 2 pRCC is a heterogeneous entity with multiple molecular subgroups [199]. Some studies suggest poorer survival for type 2 than type 1 [200], but this association is often lost in the multivariable analysis [201]. A meta-analysis did not show a significant survival difference between both types [202,203]. TFE3 re-arranged RCC (formerly called RCC with Xp11.2 translocation) has a poor prognosis [204]. Its incidence is low, but its presence should be systematically assessed in young patients. Renal cell carcinoma type classification has been confirmed by cytogenetic and genetic analyses [205-207] (LE: 2b). Surgically excised malignant complex cystic masses contain ccRCC in the majority of cases, and more than 80% are pT1. In a recent series, 5-year CSS was 98% [208]. Differences in tumour stage, grade and CSS between RCC types are illustrated in Table 6.1. Table 6.1: Baseline characteristics and cancer-specific survival of surgically treated patients by RCC type [145] Survival time% RCC% Sarcomatoid% T3-4% N1% M1% 10 year CSS (%)Clear-cell RCC8053351562Papillary RCC151115386Chromophobe RCC58154486 CSS = cancer-specific survival. In all RCC types, prognosis worsens with stage and histopathological grade (Table 6.2). The 5-year OS for all types of RCC is 49%, which has improved since 2006, probably due to an increase in incidentally detected RCCs and new systemic treatments [209,210]. Although not considered in the current N classification, the number of metastatic regional LNs is an important predictor of survival in patients without distant metastases [211].
