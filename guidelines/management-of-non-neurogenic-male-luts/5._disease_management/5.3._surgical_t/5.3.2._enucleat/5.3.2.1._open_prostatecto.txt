5.3.2.1. Open prostatectomy. Mechanism of action:Â Open prostatectomy (OP) is the oldest surgical treatment for moderate-to-severe LUTS secondary to BPO. Obstructive adenomas are enucleated using the index finger, approaching from within the bladder (Freyer procedure) or through the anterior prostatic capsule (Millin procedure). It is used for substantially enlarged glands (> 80-100 mL). Efficacy: Open prostatectomy reduces LUTS by 63-86% (12.5-23.3 IPSS points), improves QoL score by 60-87%, increases mean Qmax by 375% (+16.5-20.2 mL/s), and reduces PVR by 86-98%. Efficacy is maintained for up to six years [367-372]. Data from an Austrian nationwide study of 2,452 men submitted to OP showed that the endourological re-intervention rates after primary OP were 0.9%, 3.0%, 6.0%, and 8.8%, at three months, one year, five years, and eight years, respectively [323]. Two meta-analyses [373,374] evaluated the overall efficacy of OP performed via a transvesical approach vs. two transurethral enucleation techniques for treating patients with large glands, namely bipolar transurethral enucleation of the prostate (B-TUEP) and holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP). Five RCTs compared OP with B-TUEP [372,375-378] and four RCTs compared OP with HoLEP [367,368,379,380]. At three, six, twelve and 24-months follow-up there were no significant differences in Qmax [374]. Post-void residual, PSA, IPSS and QoL score showed no significant differences during twelve-months follow-up [374]. Open prostatectomy and HoLEP had similar improvements regarding Qmax, IPSS score and re-operation rates after five years in one RCT [367]. Tolerability and safety: Two meta-analyses evaluated the overall safety of OP performed via a transvesical approach vs. B-TUEP and HoLEP [373,374]. Operation time did not differ significantly between OP and B-TUEP but was significantly shorter for OP compared to HoLEP. Catheterisation and hospitalisation time were significantly longer for OP, which was also associated with more blood transfusions. There were no significant differences regarding other complications. There was no significant difference in IIEF-5 at three, six, twelve and 24-months follow-up. Open prostatectomy mortality has decreased significantly during the past two decades (< 0.25%) [371,381]. Data from a study of 1,286 men submitted to OP showed mortality rates of 0.2% at 30 days and 0.4% at 90 days [324]. The estimated transfusion rate was about 7-14% [367,370,371,373] Long-term complications include transient UI (up to 10%), BNC and urethral stricture (about 6%) [367-369,373,382]. Practical considerations: Open prostatectomy is the most invasive surgical method, but it is an effective and durable procedure for the treatment of LUTS/BPO. In the absence of an endourological armamentarium including a holmium laser or a bipolar system and with appropriate patient consent, OP is a reasonable surgical treatment of choice for men with prostates > 80 mL. Summary of evidenceLEOpen prostatectomy is an effective and durable procedure for the treatment of LUTS/BPO, but it is the most invasive surgical method.1bOpen prostatectomy shows similar short- and mid-term efficacy to B-TUEP and HoLEP for treating moderate-to-severe LUTS secondary to BPO in patients with large prostates.1aOpen prostatectomy has a less favourable peri-operative safety profile compared to B-TUEP and HoLEP.1aThe long-term functional results of OP are comparable to HoLEP.1b RecommendationStrength ratingOffer open prostatectomy in the absence of anatomical endoscopic enucleation of the prostate to treat moderate-to-severe LUTS in men with prostate size > 80 mL.Strong
