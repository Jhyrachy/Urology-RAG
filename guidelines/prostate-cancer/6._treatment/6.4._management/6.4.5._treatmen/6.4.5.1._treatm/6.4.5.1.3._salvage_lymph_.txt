6.4.5.1.3. Salvage lymph node dissection. The surgical management of recurrent nodal metastases in the pelvis has been the topic of several retrospective analyses [991-993] and a SR [994]. The reported five-year BCR-free survival rates ranged from 6% to 31%. Five-year OS was approximately 84% [994]. Biochemical recurrence rates were found to be dependent on PSA at salvage surgery and location and number of positive nodes [995]. Addition of RT to the lymphatic template after salvage LN dissection may improve the BCR rate [996]. In a multi-centre retrospective study long-term outcomes of 189 patients who underwent salvage LN dissection were reported to be worse than previously described in studies with shorter follow-up [997]. Biochemical recurrence (BCR)-free survival at ten years was 11%. Patients with a PSA response after salvage LN dissection and patients receiving ADT within six months from salvage LN dissection had a lower risk of death from PCa [997]. The majority of the patients (81%) had received a choline PET and median PSA at salvage LN dissection was 2.5 ng/mL. In a cohort study including patients treated with salvage LN dissection via PSMA--radioguided surgery (PSMA-RGS), two-year BCR-free survival rate was 32% [998]. In multi-variable analyses, higher pre-operative PSA, higher number of PSMA-avid lesions, multiple (pelvic plus retroperitoneal), and retroperitoneal localisation of lesions at pre-operative imaging were independent predictors of BCR after PSMA-RGS. High-level evidence for the oncological value of salvage LN dissection (including adjuvant RT of the LNs) is still lacking [994].
