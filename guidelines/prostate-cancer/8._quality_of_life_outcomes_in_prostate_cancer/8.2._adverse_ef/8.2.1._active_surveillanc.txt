8.2.1. Active surveillance. In a SR [1349] on the long-term (> five year) health-related QoL in patients on active surveillance, it was observed that there were differences in specific functional outcomes between patients on AS and surgery or radiotherapy, â‰¥ five year after treatment. In patients on AS, the overall HRQoL and psychological well-being outcomes were good. All studies comparing AS with active treatment found no substantial or consistent difference in general HRQoL PROMs between groups. In preservation of continence there is a clear advantage for AS over, active treatment, particularly to RP. Results suggest that even after extended periods, continence is still considerably superior in AS to that in RP. Obstructive voiding symptoms were more common in patients on AS than in post-operative patients. In the domain of sexual function, it is seen that AS group has better than or comparable sexual function to that in the active treatment group. Studies comparing AS with that of PCa-free patients had mixed results with papers observing no statistically significant difference and others reporting that sexual function was, at least numerically, worse in patients on AS than in PCa-free patients. All patients on AS report good quality of life, similar to that in individuals without prostate cancer [1350]. Regarding anxiety it was seen in a registry on active surveillance in the USA that men undergoing active surveillance, had a moderate risk of cancer-specific anxiety that significantly decreases over time. Patients considering active surveillance can be informed that, although it is common experience some anxiety initially, most men rapidly adjust and report low levels of anxiety within two years [1350].
