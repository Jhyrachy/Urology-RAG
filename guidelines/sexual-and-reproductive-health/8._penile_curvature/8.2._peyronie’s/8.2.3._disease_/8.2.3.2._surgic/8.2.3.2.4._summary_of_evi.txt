8.2.3.2.4. Summary of evidence and recommendations for surgical treatment of Peyronie’s disease. Summary of evidenceLESurgery for PD should only be offered in patients with stable disease and with functional impairment.2bIn patients with concomitant PD and ED without response to medical treatment, penile prosthesis implantation with or without additional straightening manoeuvres is the technique of choice.2aIn other cases, factors such as penile length, rigidity of erection, degree of curvature, presence of complex deformities and patient choice must be taken into account when deciding whether to undertake tunical shortening or lengthening procedures.3 RecommendationStrength ratingPerform surgery only when Peyronie’s disease (PD) has been stable for at least three months (without pain or deformity deterioration), which is usually the case after twelve months from the onset of symptoms, and intercourse is compromised due to the deformity.StrongAssess penile length, curvature severity, erectile function (including response to pharmacotherapy in case of erectile dysfunction [ED]) and patient expectations prior to surgery.StrongUse tunical shortening procedures as the first treatment option for congenital penile curvature and for PD with adequate penile length and rigidity, less severe curvatures and absence of complex deformities (hourglass or hinge). The type of procedure used is dependent on surgeon and patient preference, as no procedure has proven superior to its counterparts.WeakUse tunical lengthening procedures for patients with PD and normal erectile function, without adequate penile length, severe curvature or presence of complex deformities (hourglass or hinge). The type of graft used is dependent on the surgeon and patient preference, as no graft has proven superior to its counterparts.WeakDo not use the sliding technique as there is a significant risk of life changing complications (e.g., glans necrosis).StrongDo not use synthetic grafts in PD reconstructive surgery.StrongUse penile prosthesis implantation, with or without any additional straightening procedures (modelling, plication, incision or excision with or without grafting), in PD patients with ED not responding to pharmacotherapy.Strong Figure 10: Treatment algorithm for Peyronie’s disease ED = erectile dysfunction; LI-ESWT= low-intensity extracorporeal shockwave treatment; NSAIDs =non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; CCH = Collagenase Clostridium histolyticum; IFN-α2b = Interferon-α2b.
