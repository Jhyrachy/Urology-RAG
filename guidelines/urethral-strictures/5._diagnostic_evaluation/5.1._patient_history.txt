5.1. Patient history. The purpose of history taking is to assess symptoms including severity and duration, possible aetiology, prior treatments, complications, associated problems, and patient factors that may impact upon surgical outcome. The clinical presentation of urethral stricture disease is varied. In a retrospective analysis of 611 patients with an endoscopically confirmed diagnosis of urethral stricture, LUTS were the most common presentation (54.3%) followed by acute urinary retention (22.3%), urinary tract infection (UTI) (6.1%) and difficult catheterisation (4.8%) [148]. In a retrospective study of 214 patients who underwent anterior urethroplasty, weak stream was reported as the most common individual LUTS (49%) followed by incomplete emptying (27%) and urinary frequency (20%) [149]. A further retrospective series of 614 patients undergoing anterior urethroplasty found post-void dribble to be present in 73% [150]. Genitourinary pain is a common feature, affecting 22.9-71% [34,148]. Pain may be felt in the bladder and/or urethra, is associated with more severe LUTS, is more likely to be felt by younger men and resolves in most following reconstruction [32]. Other complaints include spraying (9%), visible haematuria (3.1-5%), urethral abscess/necrotising fasciitis (2.3%), urgency (14%) and incontinence (1-4%) [148,149]. To establish aetiology, an enquiry about a history of pelvic, genital, or perineal trauma, prior instrumentation, prior surgeries, irradiation or focal therapies and urethritis should be made. It is important to document prior surgical approaches and date of the most recent intervention (e.g., dilatation) as this may impact upon the timing of radiological evaluation or surgical treatment. Problems of sexual function are common in patients with urethral stricture disease [151,152] and sexual function may be impacted upon by surgical intervention [153,154]; therefore, the status of erectile and ejaculatory function should be established and documented using validated tools. The performance status of the patient should be determined as it may influence the choice of treatment (curative or palliative). A past medical history should assess for factors that may impact upon tissue healing including diabetes, immunosuppression, and smoking. Oral tobacco use or the chewing of betel leaves may increase the risk of morbidity at the harvest site or render oral mucosa too poor for use. Prior harvest of oral mucosa should be noted as alternative sources for tissue transfer may need to be considered [155] or alternative surgical approaches (e.g., perineal urethrostomy [PU]).
