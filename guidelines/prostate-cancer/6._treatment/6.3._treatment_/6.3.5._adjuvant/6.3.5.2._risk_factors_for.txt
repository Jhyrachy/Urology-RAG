6.3.5.2. Risk factors for relapse. Patients with ISUP grade group > 2 in combination with EPE (pT3a) and particularly those with SV invasion (pT3b) and/or positive surgical margins are at high risk of progression, which can be as high as 50% after five years [820]. Irrespective of the pT stage, the number of removed nodes [821-828], tumour volume within the LNs and capsular perforation of the nodal metastases are predictors of early recurrence after RP for pN1 disease [829]. A LN density (defined as ‘the percentage of positive LNs in relation to the total number of analysed/removed LNs’) of over 20% was found to be associated with poor prognosis [830]. The number of involved nodes seems to be a major factor for predicting relapse [823,824,831]; the threshold considered is less than 3 positive nodes from an ePLND [540,823,831]. However, prospective data are needed before defining a definitive threshold value. 6.3.5.2.1. Biomarker-based risk stratification after radical prostatectomy The Decipher® gene signature consists of a 22-gene panel representing multiple biological pathways and was developed to predict systemic progression after definitive treatment. A meta-analysis of five studies analysed the performance of the Decipher® Genomic Classifier (GC) test on men post-RP. The authors showed in multivariable analysis that Decipher® GC remained a statistically significant predictor of metastasis (HR: 1.30, 95% CI: 1.14–1.47, p < 0.001) per 0.1 unit increase in score and concluded that it can independently improve prognostication of patients post-RP within nearly all clinicopathologic, demographic, and treatment subgroups [832]. A SR of the evidence for the Decipher® GC has confirmed the clinical utility of this test in post-RP decision-making [833]. Further studies are needed to establish how to best incorporate Decipher® GC in clinical decision-making.
