7.7.2.2. First line therapy in patients not eligible for combination therapy. Limited data exist regarding the optimal treatment for this patient population which is characterised by severely impaired PS (PS > 2) and/or severely impaired renal function (GFR < 30 mL/min) or inadequate organ function. Historically, the outcome in this patient group has been poor. Best supportive care has often been chosen instead of systemic therapy. Most trials evaluating alternative treatment options to cisplatinum-based chemotherapy did not focus specifically on this patient population, making data interpretation difficult. The FDA (but not EMA) has approved pembrolizumab as a first-line treatment for patients not fit to receive any platinum-based chemotherapy regardless of PD-L1 status based on the results of one single-arm phase II trial [509]. Based on the results of two single arm phase II trials trials [509,510] the checkpoint inhibitors pembrolizumab and atezolizumab have been approved by EMA for first-line treatment in cisplatin- unfit patients in case of positive PD-L1 status. PD-L1 positivity for use of pembrolizumab is defined by immunohistochemistry as a CPS of ≥ 10 using the Dako 22C33 platform and for atezolizumab as positivity of ≥ 5% tumour-infiltrating immune cells using Ventana SP142. Pembrolizumab was tested in 370 patients with advanced or metastatic UC ineligible for cisplatin, showing an ORR of 29% and CR in 7% of patients [509,511]. Atezolizumab was evaluated in the same patient population in a phase II trial (n = 119) showing an ORR of 23% with 9% of patients achieving CR [510]. First-line avelumab was evaluated in patients with PD-L1 positive, metastatic or locally advanced disease and demonstrated a median OS of 10.0 months (95% CI: 5.5-14.5 months) with 43% of patients alive at 1 year. A complete response was achieved in 8.5% of patients, and 15.5% had a partial response [512]. A phase 2 randomised trial (BAYOU) evaluating durvalumab with olaparib or placebo in platinum-ineligible patients with metastatic UC demonstrated no PFS or OS benefit for the addition of olaparib; however, in a secondary analysis of patients with homologous recombination repair gene mutations, PFS was improved with the addition of olaparib as compared to placebo (median PFS was 5.6 months (95% CI, 1.9 to 8.1) versus 1.8 months (95% CI, 1.7 to 2.2), (HR, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.06 to 0.47) [513]. The trials IMvigor 130, Keynote 361 and DANUBE all included an experimental arm with immunotherapy alone using atezolizumab, pembrolizumab and durvalumab, respectively [514-516]. No benefit in terms of PFS or OS for the use of single-agent immunotherapy compared to platinum-based chemotherapy was found. The combination of carboplatin/gemcitabine therefore is still considered the preferred first-line treatment choice for patients planned to receive chemotherapy who are ineligible for cisplatin.
