4.1. Staging. The Tumour Node Metastasis (TNM) classification system is recommended for clinical and scientific use [81]. A supplement was published in 2012, and the latter’s prognostic value was confirmed in single- and multi-institution studies [82,83]. Tumour size, venous invasion, renal capsular invasion, adrenal involvement, LN and distant metastasis are included in the TNM classification system (Table 4.1). However, some uncertainties remain: The sub-classification of T1 tumours using a cut-off of 4 cm might not be optimal in NSS for localised cancer [84];The value of size stratification of T2 tumours has been questioned [85];Renal sinus fat invasion might carry a worse prognosis than perinephric fat invasion, but, is nevertheless included in the same pT3a stage group [86-89] (LE: 3);Sub T-stages (pT2b, pT3a, pT3c and pT4) may overlap [83];For adequate M staging, accurate pre-operative imaging (chest and abdominal CT) should be performed [90,91] (LE: 4). A proposed imaging analysis of Tumor Contour Irregularity might be a valuable tool to enhance the preoperative staging between T1 and T3a RCCs for treatment decisions [92]. The TNM classification should not be considered the only criterion for clinical decision-making, but patient’s condition, comorbidities and wishes are of fundamental importance to select the most optimal treatment. A clinically-guided RCC staging classification was proposed in 2022 by the EAU Panel, based on changes observed in the management of SRM, locally advanced and metastatic disease [84].
