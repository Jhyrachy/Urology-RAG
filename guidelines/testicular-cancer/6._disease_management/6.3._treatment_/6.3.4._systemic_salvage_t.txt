6.3.4. Systemic salvage treatment for relapse or refractory disease. Cisplatin combination salvage chemotherapy will result in long-term remissions in approximately 50% of patients who relapse after first-line chemotherapy. These results are highly dependent on several prognostic factors [244]. The regimens of choice are four cycles of a three-agent regimen including cisplatin and ifosfamide plus a third drug: etoposide (VIP), paclitaxel (TIP), or potentially gemcitabine (GIP) (Table 7) [245,246]. No RCT has compared these regimens. Due to their potential risk of lethal haematological toxicity, these regimens should be used with G-CSF support and by well-trained oncologists.

A retrospective analysis by the International Prognostic Factors Study Group (IPFSG) evaluated the risk of relapse in patients in whom this occurred after at least three cisplatin cycles and subsequent cisplatin conventional-dose or carboplatin-based high-dose salvage chemotherapy [149]. Seven variables: histology, primary tumour location, response, progression-free interval after first-line treatment and level of AFP, β-hCG and the presence of liver, bone or brain metastasis at salvage treatment, were identified as independent prognostic variables of relapse after initial cisplatin chemotherapy [149]. Using these factors, five risk-groups: very low-risk = -1 points; low-risk = 0 points; intermediate-risk = 1-2 points; high-risk = 3-4 points; and very high-risk > 5 points; were identified with significant differences in PFS and OS. Table 9 illustrates these five risk groups and the corresponding two-year PFS and three-year OS rates [149]. Several recent trials have validated this scoring system [247-250]. As in first-line therapy, the prognostic impact of tumour marker decline applies in the salvage setting [251]. While progression to induction chemotherapy was negative for OS, prior use of paclitaxel was not significantly associated with a negative outcome [252]. A secondary analysis of the IPFSG cohort (n = 1,600 patients) showed a 10-15% improvement in OS in all prognostic subgroups when treated with high-dose salvage therapy compared to standard dose therapy. This is being evaluated in an RCT of HDCT vs. conventional dose chemotherapy in patients with first-line relapse is underway (Tiger trial). When HDCT is used as a salvage treatment, sequential treatment cycles of high-dose carboplatin and etoposide (HD-CE) should be preferred to a single high-dose regimen as the former is associated with less toxicity-related deaths [247]. A recent SR confirmed the superiority of using at least two high-dose cycles in the salvage setting over a single high-dose cycle [253]. It is clearly of the utmost importance that these rare patients with relapse are treated within clinical trials and at specialised centres.
