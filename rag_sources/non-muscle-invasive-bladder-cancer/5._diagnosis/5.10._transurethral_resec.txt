5.10. transurethral resection tat1 bladder tumours. 5.10.1. strategy procedure goals turb tat1 bc establish accurate pathological diagnosis/staging completely remove visible lesions. crucial procedure management bc. transurethral resection bladder tumours performed systematically individual steps (see section 5.14). operative steps necessary achieve successful turb include identifying factors required assign disease risk (number tumours, size, architecture, location, concern presence cis, recurrent vs. primary tumour), clinical stage (bimanual examination anaesthesia, assignment clinical tumour stage), adequacy resection (visually complete resection, visualisation muscle resection base), visualisation tumour distal ureter presence complications (assessment perforation) . documentation cystoscopic tumour characteristics consequent clinically predicted tumour grade stage help assign patients post-turb single instillation chemotherapy (low grade non-invasive) muscle invasive cancers fast tracked definitive treatment . measure size largest tumour, one use end cutting loop, approximately 1 cm wide, reference. tumour architecture sessile, nodular, papillary, mixed papillary/solid flat. 5.10.2. surgical technical aspects tumour resection 5.10.2.1. surgical strategy resection (piecemeal/separate resection, en-bloc resection) complete resection, performed either fractioned en-bloc technique, essential achieve good prognosis . piecemeal resection fractions (separate resection exophytic part tumour, underlying bladder wall edges resection area) provides good information vertical horizontal extent tumour . whilst technique carried using loop diathermy (monopolar bipolar), thulium-yag laser potentially feasible alternative .en-bloc resection using monopolar bipolar current, thulium-yag holmium-yag ktp-green light lasers feasible selected exophytic tumours. provides high-quality resected specimens presence detrusor muscle 96–100% cases [141,147-154]; however, superiority conventional turb remains debatable . detrusor muscle sampling rates different techniques systematic review 1,142 patients , single centre rct showing similar detrusor muscle sampling rates 95% conventional turb en-bloc resection . conversely, another systematic review 4,484 patients revealed higher detrusor muscle sampling rates favour en-bloc resection , multicentre rct found significantly higher detrusor muscle rates en-bloc compared conventional turb (80.7 vs 71.1) . respect tumour architecture increases accuracy t1 staging possibility sub-staging potentially reducing risk bladder perforation [147,152-155]. regards oncological outcomes, two rcts reveal difference time recurrence en-bloc resection conventional turb . also shown two systematic reviews . technique selected dependent size location tumour experience surgeon. tumour size feasible retrieval en-bloc limited currently available endoscopic equipment shown technical success declines tumours larger three cm . better detection tumours abnormal margins, methods optical enhancement expected improve complete resection rates (see section 5.11). 5.10.2.2. evaluation resection quality absence detrusor muscle specimen associated significantly higher risk residual disease, early recurrence, tumour under-staging (le: 1b). presence detrusor muscle specimen considered surrogate criterion resection quality required (except ta lg/ g1 tumours). surgical checklists quality performance indicator programmes shown increase surgical quality (accurate documentation factors required assign risk sample detrusor muscle) decrease recurrence rates [140,142,160-162]. panel included sample turb checklist table 5.1 reported quality indicators procedure table 9.1. shown surgical experience improve turb results, supports role teaching programmes . virtual training simulators emerging approach . role teaching process still needs established . surgical experience and/or volume associated risk complications , recurrence survival retrospective studies. despite relatively low overall rate detrusor muscle (dm) sampling, collaborative study 503 patients demonstrated higher utilisation surgical checklists residents associated higher rate detrusor muscle sampling (62.9%) vs. ‘experts’ (50.6%) who’s utilisation checklists lower . 5.10.2.3. monopolar bipolar resection compared monopolar resection, bipolar resection introduced reduce risk complications (e.g., bladder perforation due obturator nerve stimulation) produce better specimens. currently, results remain controversial [168-170], significant inherent limitations due selection bias, heterogeneity surgical approach inability qualify surgeon experience. systematic review 13 rcts (2,379 patients) showed benefit bipolar vs. monopolar turb efficacy safety one meta-analysis rcts (n = 2,099) suggests lower fall haemoglobin shorter hospital stay bipolar resections another systematic review rcts observational studies (n = 19,927) suggests lesser thermal artifacts specimen . 5.10.2.4. resection small papillary bladder tumours time transurethral resection prostate (turp) uncommon incidentally detect bladder tumours turp men benign prostatic hyperplasia. provided tumours papillary, rather small extensively multifocal, seems feasible resect tumours continue resection prostate . simultaneous turb turp appear lead increased risk tumour recurrence progression . whilst reports suggested surgeons prefer undertake saline irrigation following combined turbt turp, post-operative single instillation chemotherapy also appears feasible safe provided capsular bladder perforation .
