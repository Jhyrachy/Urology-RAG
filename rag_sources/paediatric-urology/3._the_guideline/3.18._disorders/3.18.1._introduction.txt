3.18.1. introduction. formerly called ‘intersex disorders’, constellation conditions subject consensus document decided term ‘intersex’ changed ‘disorders/differences sex development’ (dsd), however original term still used resolution parliamentary assembly council europe (see below) . new classification arisen due advances knowledge molecular genetic causes abnormal sexual development, controversies inherent clinical management, ethical issues. controversial negative terminology, e.g., ‘pseudohermaphroditism’ ‘hermaphroditism’, renamed according new pathophysiological insights. furthermore, conditions presenting severe male genital malformation, penile agenesis cloacal exstrophy, could previously categorised, also included. term ‘disorders/differences sex development’ proposed indicate congenital conditions atypical development chromosomal, gonadal anatomical sex. addition this, 2017 parliamentary assembly council europe decided resolution termed: “promoting human rights eliminating discrimination intersex people” . assembly concluded majority ‘intersex’ people (cited verbatim resolution) physically healthy suffered medical conditions put health risk. furthermore, stated prevailing medical view time bodies ‘intersex’ children could, made conform either male female paradigm, often surgical and/or hormonal intervention, performed early possible children could raised gender corresponding assigned sex. parliamentary assembly considered approach involved serious breaches physical integrity autonomy, many cases concerning young children infants unable give informed consent whose gender identity unknown. therefore, parliamentary assembly called council europe member states effectively protect children’s rights physical integrity bodily autonomy, empowering ‘intersex’ people following rights: medically unnecessary sex-“normalising” surgery, sterilisation treatments practised ‘intersex’ children without informed consent prohibited, addition ensured that, except cases life child immediate risk, treatment seeks alter sex characteristics child including gonads, genitals internal sex organs, deferred time child able participate decision, based right self-determination, principle free informed consent. panel refers consensus documents mentioned well parliamentary assembly resolution. chapter focus relevant practising paediatric urologist, likely involved neonates dsd conditions. overall, evidence-based literature dsd sparse. rcts, studies based retrospective, clinical descriptive studies, expert opinion. exception made relation risk gonadal cancer, level evidence higher . disorders/differences sex development present prenatal diagnosis, neonatal diagnosis, late diagnosis. prenatal diagnosis based karyotype sonographic findings; neonatal diagnosis based genital ambiguity, late diagnosis usually made result early delayed puberty. guideline, focus neonatal presentation, paediatric urologist plays central role. several publications last couple decades exploring role prenatal corticosteroid treatment patients congenital adrenal hyperplasia. endocrine society still proclaims use restricted research settings, treatment remains experimental . late diagnoses, refer endocrinology gynaecology guidelines precocious delayed puberty, paediatric urologists play less central role . dealing neonates dsd requires multi-disciplinary approach, ideally include geneticists, neonatologists, paediatric adult endocrinologists, paediatric urologists, gynaecologists, psychologists, ethicists social workers. team member ideally experienced dsd team treated enough patients ensure experience. discrepancy often perceived research topics proposed research scientists considered important dsd patients . result discrepancy, collaborative networks ‘dsd-life’ consortium, established include research scientists, health professionals, patient families, support groups (available from: https://www.dsd-life.eu/home/index.html0. dsd-life study, focus patients care-givers consider priority, research carried around issue. addition, newly established european reference network (ern) covering rare endocrine conditions (endo-ern) considers patient participation research database management crucial (available from: https://endo-ern.eu/.
