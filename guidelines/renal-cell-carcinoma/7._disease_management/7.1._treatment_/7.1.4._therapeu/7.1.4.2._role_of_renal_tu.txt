7.1.4.2. Role of renal tumour biopsy before active surveillance. Histological characterisation of SRMs by renal tumour biopsy is useful to select tumours at lower risk of progression based on grade and histotype, which can be safely managed with AS. Pathology can also help to tailor surveillance imaging schedules. In the largest cohort of biopsy-proven, small, sporadic RCCs followed with AS, a significant difference in growth and progression among different RCC subtypes was observed. Clear-cell RCC SRMs grew faster than papillary type 1 SRMs (0.25 and 0.02 cm/year on average, respectively, p = 0.0003) [378].
