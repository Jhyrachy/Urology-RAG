8.2.1. Epidemiology. Epidemiological data on PD are limited. Prevalence rates of 0.4-20.3% have been reported, with a higher prevalence in patients with ED and diabetes [856-864]. A recent survey has indicated that the prevalence of definitive and probable cases of PD in the USA is 0.7% and 11%, respectively, suggesting that PD is an under-diagnosed condition [865]. Peyronieâ€™s disease often occurs in older men with a typical age of onset of 50-60 years. However, PD also occurs in younger men (< 40 years), with a reported prevalence of 1.5-16.9% [860,866,867].
