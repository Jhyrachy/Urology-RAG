6.7.13. Guidelines for systematic treatments of castrate-resistant disease. Summary statement for mCRPC first line combination therapy: The combination of ARPI plus PARP inhibitors showed a significant rPFS benefit in RCTs for unselected patients. However, this benefit is mainly driven by HRR- and even more pronounced by BRCA 1/2- altered patients. So far, no clear OS benefit was seen, and the side effects of PARP inhibitors add substantial toxicity to ARPI monotherapy. Therefore, no recommendation is given for patients without HRR or BRCA 1/2 -mutations and the data will be re-evaluated after longer follow-up. RecommendationsStrength ratingBase the choice of treatment on the performance status (PS), symptoms, comorbidities, location and extent of disease, genomic profile, patient preference, and on previous treatment for hormone-sensitive metastatic PCa (mHSPC) (alphabetical order: abiraterone, cabazitaxel, docetaxel, enzalutamide, 177lutetium-PSMA-617-radioligand therapy, radium-223, sipuleucel-T, and for patients with DNA homologous recombination repair (HRR) alterations olaparib, olaparib/abiraterone, niraparib/abiraterone, rucaparib, talazoparib/enzalutamide).StrongAvoid sequencing of androgen receptor targeted agents.WeakOffer chemotherapy to patients previously treated with abiraterone or enzalutamide.StrongOffer patients with metastatic castrate-resistant PCa (mCRPC) who are candidates for cytotoxic therapy and are chemotherapy naiive docetaxel with 75 mg/m2 every three weeks.StrongOffer patients previously untreated for mCRPC and harbouring an HRR or BRCA mutation abiraterone in combination with olaparib if the patient is fit for both agents.StrongOffer patients previously untreated for mCRPC and harbouring a BRCA mutation abiraterone in combination with niraparib if the patient is fit for both agents.StrongOffer patients previously untreated for mCRPC and harbouring an HRR-mutation enzalutamide in combination with talazoparib if the patient is fit for both agents.StrongOffer poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors to pre-treated mCRPC patients with relevant DNA repair gene mutations.StrongOffer patients with mCRPC and progression following docetaxel chemotherapy further life-prolonging treatment options, which include abiraterone, cabazitaxel, enzalutamide, radium-223 and olaparib in case of DNA homologous recombination repair (HRR) alterations.StrongBase further treatment decisions of mCRPC on PS, previous treatments, symptoms, comorbidities, genomic profile, extent of disease and patient preference.StrongOffer abiraterone or enzalutamide to patients previously treated with one or two lines of chemotherapy.StrongOffer cabazitaxel to patients previously treated with docetaxel.StrongOffer cabazitaxel to patients previously treated with docetaxel and progressing within twelve months of treatment with abiraterone or enzalutamide.StrongOffer 177Lu-PSMA-617 to pre-treated mCRPC patients with one or more metastatic lesions, highly expressing PSMA (exceeding the uptake in the liver) on the diagnostic radiolabelled PSMA PET/CT scan.Strong
