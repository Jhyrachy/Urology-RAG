6.3.4. Perineal urethrostomy. 6.3.4.1. Indications Perineal urethrostomy offers a permanent or temporary solution for restoration of voiding in men with complex urethral stricture disease in whom: there are no further options to restore urethral patency either due to multiple previous failed urethroplasties [305,339] or multiple co-morbidities precluding a more expansive surgical undertaking after failed endoscopic management [363]; there is a lack of certainty on behalf of the surgeon regarding the most appropriate form of urethroplasty for the patient;following urethrectomy and/or penectomy for cancer [364]. 6.3.4.2. Types of perineal urethrostomy Johanson described an inverted anterior scrotal funnel PU in 1953. This was later modified by Gil-Vernet and Blandy to utilise a posteriorly based scrotal flap. Both these techniques utilise an inverted U or lambda incision. The Gil-Vernet-Blandy PU has been further modified with the addition of dorsal and/or ventral free OMG augment to allow use of PU in men with strictures consequent to radiotherapy [365] or LS [259] and/or in men with PU stenosis or stricture extending into the proximal bulbar or membranous urethra (“augmented Blandy”) [363]. More recently, the ‘7 flap’ PU utilising a unilateral posteriorly based scrotal flap has been developed for use in the very obese, or in men of all BMI with stricture extension into the proximal bulbar or membranous urethra [366]. Initially this was performed with transection of the distal bulbar urethra but latterly the technique has been modified to a non-transection technique with loop mobilisation of the bulbar urethra (“loop PU”) [367]. The “7-flap” utilises a midline incision – which has been shown to have a significantly reduced side-effect profile in terms of superficial wound infection (1.9% c.f. 18.6%) and superficial wound dehiscence (11.9% c.f. 23.3%) than the inverted U or lambda incision [368,369] and may be associated with improved urethroplasty (and by inference PU) outcomes, at least in the short term (0% failure c.f. 6.2% failure at six months) [368]. Operative time is similar for all types of PU with mean operative time varying between 97.2 minutes to112 minutes [364,370]. The utilisation of PU is increasing [371] – constituting 4.5% of 403 procedures for complex urethral stricture disease in a tertiary centre in 2008 and 38.7% in 2017 [372]. Perineal urethrostomy patients are generally older than those having urethroplasty with a median of 62.6 years of age for men having PU in Fuchs et al., 2018 series compared with a median of 53.2 years for men having anterior urethroplasty [372]. Between 18.7% and 73.4% of men having staged urethroplasty for complex anterior urethral stricture decline to proceed to 2nd stage re-tubularisation after a successful 1st stage and remain voiding from the PU of their 1st stage urethroplasty [257,339,342]. 6.3.4.3. Outcomes 6.3.4.3.1. Patency rates Patency rates of 70-95% at mean/median follow-up of 20–63 months have been described [305,339,347,363-366,370,372]. All reports are retrospective series – all of which are heterogenous in terms of indications and patients. There is consequently little data available to determine which is the best technique for PU. McKibben et al., reported a patency rate of 92.9% in 42 patients for “7-flap” PU at median follow-up of  53.6 months, whilst they had a 100% patency rate with loop PU in twenty patients at a median follow-up of thirteen months [367]. Lumen et al., in 2015 reported a 74.3% patency rate for Johanson PU compared with an 87.5% patency rate for Gil-Vernet-Blandy PU (p=0.248), but with a significantly longer follow-up after Johanson PU (median 36 vs. nine months) [364]. Barbagli et al., published the largest series of PU patients to date – including 173 men (all of whom had been planned to have a staged urethroplasty for their complex anterior urethral stricture disease and 127 (73.4%) of whom declined to proceed with 2nd stage re-tubularisation). The median follow-up in this series was 62 months and the patency rate was 70% - confirming that patency rates for PU (and indeed for all urethroplasty [273,346]) reduce with time [339]. See supplementary Table S6.11 for further information. 6.3.4.3.2. Complications Perineal urethrostomy complications occur in 2.5-11.4% and include superficial wound dehiscence, scrotal abscess, UTI and urosepsis, bleeding, and transient scrotal pain and numbness [305,364,373]. The majority of complications are Clavien-Dindo grades 1 (2.9-18.8%) and 2 (0-2.9%). Grade 3 complications are rare and only occur in 5.7-6.2%. In the medium-term 22.2-30.8% of men with PU report post-micturition dribble [364]. 6.3.4.3.3. Patient reported outcomes Barbagli et al., reported that 168/173 (97.1%) of men were satisfied or very satisfied with the outcome of their Gil-Vernet-Blandy PU and would have the procedure again at median 62 months follow-up. Of these, 166/173 (95.9%) felt they had excellent or good results from their Gil-Vernet-Blandy PU, 145/173 (85%) felt it caused them no problems and 141/173 (82%) felt it caused their partner no problems [339]. The Trauma and Urologic Reconstructive Network of Surgeons (TURNS) collaborative found no significant change in sexual function and a significant improvement in urinary symptoms following PU in a small group of patients [374], whilst Lumen et al., found satisfactory or acceptable International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) outcomes in 26/32 (81.25%) of men with Johanson or Gil-Vernet-Blandy PU at a median follow-up of 32 months and nine months, respectively. McKibben et al., found a mean patient global impression of improvement (PGI-I) of 1.3 in nineteen patients with either loop PU or “7-flap” PU [367] at median 31 months follow-up. 6.3.4.3.4. Risk factors for patency failure of the perineal urethrostomy Lichen sclerosus, trauma and infection urethral strictures have poorer outcomes from PU, with PU patency failure in 36.7-67% at a median 62 month follow-up [339,373]. Worse outcomes were also observed in patients with previous failed urethroplasty and multiple previous endoscopic and open treatments [339,364,365]. Barbagli et al., found that stricture length was inversely related to PU patency, as was patient age [339]. Conversely Viers et al., found outcomes worsened with age, reporting patency rates of 100% in men < 50 years old compared with 83% in men aged 60-69 years old [347]. Lopez et al., found increased risk of PU failure in men with ischaemic heart disease which makes sense and would be a putative explanation for the age-related worsening of outcomes noted by Viers et al., [373]. Failure of PU is most commonly treated with surgical revision of PU using V-Y plasty, augmentation or complete ReDo but can also be managed with periodic dilatation or urinary diversion [339,363,364].
