7.7.2.1. First-line chemotherapy in patients fit for combination therapy. 7.7.2.1.1. Enfortumab vedotin plus Pembrolizumab The combination of Enfortumab vedotin (EV) plus pembrolizumab represents the new standard of care for patients who are deemed fit for combination therapies. This is based on EV-302/KEYNOTE 39A, a phase III trial that tested the antibody drug conjugate EV directed against nectin-4 (EV: administered any number of times until progression) in combination with the immune checkpoint inhibitor, pembrolizumab (maximum of 35 cycles) against platinum-based chemotherapy (cisplatin or carboplatin permitted) in combination with gemcitabine (up to 6 cycles) in the first-line advanced unresectable or metastatic urothelial carcinoma. 30% of the patients in the control arm received switch maintenance immunotherapy with avelumab. Both co-primary endpoints, PFS and OS were clearly met with a significant improvement in median PFS of 12.5 vs 6.3 months (HR 0.45 (0.38-0.54) and median OS of 31.5 vs. 16.1 months (HR 0.47 (0.38-0.58), respectively. The overall ORR was 67.7% including 29.1% complete remissions (CR) compared to 44.4% (12.5% CR) with platinum-based chemotherapy (p<0.00001). All pre-specified subgroups benefited equally from EV+pembrolizumab regardless of cisplatin eligibility, PD-L1 expression or presence of liver metastases. Treatment-related toxicity grade≥ 3 was reported in 55% for EV/Pembrolizumab versus 70% in the chemotherapy arm. Specific and relevant EV toxicities include skin rash, peripheral neuropathy, ocular disorders and hyperglycemia. Toxicity of EV/Pembrolizumab needs to be managed proactively and attentively to avoid severe sequelae. The administration of EV/Pembrolizumab requires adequate knowledge and care from a specialised interprofessional team [487]. The combination of EV and pembrolizumab as the first-line treatment in 45 cisplatin-ineligible patients with locally-advanced/metastatic UC was also investigated in EV-103, phase 1b/2 study, and demonstrated a confirmed objective response rate after a median of nine cycles of 73.3% with a complete response rate of 15.6% [492]. The median duration of response and median OS were 25.6 months and 26.1 months, respectively. The most common treatment-related AEs were peripheral sensory neuropathy (55.6%), fatigue (51.1%), and alopecia (48.9%) [492]. A second cohort within the same study randomly assigned previously untreated cisplatin-ineligible patients to EV alone or EV with pembrolizumab [493]. The ORR was 64.5% (95% CI, 52.7 to 75.1) and 45.2% (95% CI, 33.5 to 57.3) for patients treated with EV+ pembrolizumab (N = 76) and EV monotherapy (N = 73), respectively. The median DOR was not reached for the combination and was 13.2 months for monotherapy. Based on these results enfortumab vedotin plus pembrolizumab has been granted FDA accelerated approval for patients with locally advanced or metastatic UC who are ineligible for cisplatin-containing chemotherapy. 7.7.2.1.2. Paitents eligible for combination therapy but not eligible for EV or EV not available In spite of the very recent results of EV-302/KEYNOTE 39A study, EV will not be available in different countries. Moreover, some patients might not be eligible for or refuse treatment with EV including patients with uncontrolled diabetes, peripheral neuropathy grade ≥ 2 and pre-existing significant skin disorders. Platinum-based chemotherapy with integration of checkpoint inhibitors represents the preferred options in such patients. The general presumptions for cisplatin- and carboplatin-based therapy remain unchanged in this case and are outlined below. 7.7.2.1.2.1.Patients fit for cisplatin Cisplatin-containing combination chemotherapy was the standard of care since the late 1980s demonstrating an OS of 12 to 14 months in different series (for a review see [494]). Methotrexate, vinblastine, adriamycin plus cisplatin and GC achieved survival of 14.8 and 13.8 months, respectively [495]. Overall response rates were 46% for MVAC and 49% for GC. The lower toxicity of GC [200] compared to standard MVAC has resulted in GC becoming the standard regimen. Dose-dense MVAC combined with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) is less toxic and more efficacious than standard MVAC in terms of, complete response (CR), and 2-year OS. However, there is no significant difference in median survival between the two regimens [496,497]. Further intensification of treatment using paclitaxel, cisplatin and gemcitabine (PCG) triplet regimen did not result in a significant improvement in OS in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population of a phase III RCT, comparing PCG to GC [498]. Similarly, the addition of the angiogenesis inhibitor bevacizumab to GC did not result in OS improvement [499]. The disease sites have an impact on long-term survival. In LN-only disease, 20.9% of patients were alive at five years compared to only 6.8% of patients with visceral metastases [495]. In the trials with long-term follow-up, approximately 10-15% of patients with metastatic UC were alive at 5 years and longer, suggesting a sustained benefit from cisplatin-based chemotherapy in a minority of patients [495,497]. Carboplatin-containing chemotherapy, without the inclusion of immunotherapy, is not considered to be equivalent to cisplatin-based combinations, and should not be considered interchangeable or standard in patients fit for cisplatin. A comparative analysis of four randomised phase II trials of carboplatin vs. cisplatin combination chemotherapy demonstrated lower CR rates and shorter OS for the carboplatin arms [500].A retrospective study highlighted the importance of applying cisplatin in cisplatin-eligible patients in order to maintain benefit [501]. Switch maintenance with immunotherapy after platinum-based chemotherapy A randomised phase II trial evaluated switch maintenance treatment with pembrolizumab in patients achieving at least stable disease on platinum-based first-line chemotherapy. The primary endpoint of PFS was met (5.4 months vs. 3.0 months, HR: 0.65, p = 0.04) [502]. The JAVELIN Bladder 100 study investigated the impact of switch maintenance with the PD-L1 inhibitor avelumab after initial treatment with platinum-gemcitabine chemotherapy. Patients achieving at least stable disease or better after 4–6 cycles of platinum-gemcitabine were randomised to avelumab or best supportive care (BSC). Overall survival was the primary endpoint which improved to 21.4 months with avelumab compared to 14.3 months with BSC (HR: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.56–0.86; p < 0.001). Of patients who discontinued BSC and received subsequent treatment 53% received immunotherapy. Immune-related AEs occurred in 29% of all patients and 7% experienced grade 3 complications [503]. Patient-reported ouctomes from JAVELIN Bladder 100 demonstrated no detrimental effect on quality of life [504]. Maintenance IO with avelumab was until recently standard of care for all patients with at least stable disease on first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. If patients are fit for cisplatin, the results of CheckMate 901 should be considered [488]. This trial tested the addition of nivolumab in combination with gemcitabine/cisplatin (GC) and followed by nivolumab maintenance (until progression or maximum of 24 months) compared to GC alone. Of note, only 9% in the control arm received switch maintenance therapy with avelumab. The co-primary endpoints, PFS and OS were reached with a median PFS of 7.9 vs 7.6 months (HR 0.72, 95%CI 0.59-0.88) and a median OS of 21.7 vs. 18.9 months (HR 0.78, 95%CI 0.63-0.96). The response rate was improved with GC plus Nivolumab (57.6% vs 43.1.%). A complete remission (CR) was achieved in 21.7% of patients with Nivolumab plus GC with a duration of 37.1 months. Nivolumab plus GC had higher treatment related grade ≥3 toxicity (62% vs 52%). This combination represents an alternative to GC followed by maintenance therapy with avelumab in patients not eligible for EV or if EV is not available. 7.7.2.1.2.2.Patients fit for carboplatin (but unfit for cisplatin) Up to 50% of patients are not fit for cisplatin-containing chemotherapy but most may be candidates for carboplatin [433]. A randomised phase II/III trial in this setting was conducted by the EORTC and compared two carboplatin-containing regimens (methotrexate/carboplatin/vinblastine [M-CAVI] and gemcitabine/carboplatin [GemCarbo]) in patients unfit for cisplatin. The EORTC definitions for eligibility were GFR < 60 mL/min and/or PS 2. Severe acute toxicity was 13.6% with GemCarbo vs. 23% with M-CAVI, while the ORR was 42% for GemCarbo and 30% for M-CAVI, respectively [491]. Based on these results the combination of carboplatin and gemcitabine should be considered a standard of care in this patient group. Importantly, both EV-302/KEYNOTE 39A and JAVELIN Bladder 100 included patients fit for carboplatin, while CheckMate 901 included patients fit for cisplatin only. Combinations of gemcitabine and paclitaxel have been studied as first-line treatment and produced response rates between 38% and 60% but has never been tested in RCTs [505-507]. A randomised phase II trial assessed the efficacy and tolerability profile of two vinflunine-based regimens (vinflunine/gemcitabine vs. vinflunine/carboplatin). Both regimens showed equal ORR and OS with less haematologic toxicity for the combination of vinflunine/gemcitabine [508]. Non-platinum combination chemotherapy is nevertheless not recommended for first-line use in platinum-eligible patients. The use of single-agent chemotherapy has been associated with varying response rates. Responses with single agents are usually short, complete responses are rare, and no long-term DFS/OS has been reported. It is not recommended for first-line treatment of metastatic UC.
