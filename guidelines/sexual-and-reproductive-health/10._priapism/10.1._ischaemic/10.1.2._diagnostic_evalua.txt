10.1.2. Diagnostic evaluation. 10.1.2.1. History Taking a comprehensive history is critical in priapism diagnosis and treatment [1336,1359]. The medical history must specifically enquire about SCD or any other haematological abnormality [1360,1361] and a history of pelvic, genital or perineal trauma. The sexual history must include the duration of the erection; the presence and degree of pain; prior drug treatment and recreational drug use; history of priapism and methods of treatment; and erectile function prior to the last priapism episode [1336]. The history can help to determine the underlying priapism subtype (Table 36). Ischaemic priapism is classically associated with progressive penile pain and the erection is rigid. Conversely, non-ischaemic priapism is often painless and the erections often fluctuate in rigidity. Table 36: Key findings in priapism (adapted from BroderickÂ et al.

Physical examination In ischaemic priapism, the corpora are fully rigid and tender, but the glans penis is soft. The patient usually complains of severe pain. Pelvic examination may reveal an underlying pelvic or genitourinary malignancy [1356]. 10.1.2.3. Laboratory testing Laboratory testing should include a complete blood count, white blood cell count with blood cell differential, platelet count and coagulation profile to assess anaemia and detect haematological abnormalities [1336,1359]. Aspiration of blood from the corpora cavernosa is compulsory as an entry level investigation. It usually reveals dark ischaemic blood. Blood gas analysis is essential to differentiate between ischaemic and non-ischaemic priapism (Table 36). Further laboratory testing should be directed by the history, clinical examination and laboratory findings. These may include specific tests (e.g., haemoglobin electrophoresis) for diagnosis of SCD or other haemoglobinopathies. 10.1.2.4. Penile imaging Colour Doppler US of the penis and perineum is recommended after clinical diagnosis and can differentiate ischaemic from non-ischaemic priapism as an alternative or adjunct to blood gas analysis (Figure 12) [1362-1365]. Colour Doppler US can identify the presence of the fistula as a blush with 100% sensitivity and 73% specificity [1364]. Ultrasound of the penis should be performed before corporal blood aspiration in ischaemic priapism to prevent aberrant blood flow which can mimic a non-ischaemic or reperfusion picture after intervention for low-flow priapism [1366]. Penile MRI can be used in the diagnostic evaluation of priapism and may be helpful in selected cases of ischaemic priapism to assess the viability of the corpora cavernosa and the presence of penile fibrosis. In cases of refractory priapism or delayed presentation (> 48 hours), smooth muscle viability can be indirectly assessed. In a prospective study of 38 patients with ischaemic priapism, the sensitivity of MRI in predicting non-viable smooth muscle was 100%, when correlated with corpus cavernosum biopsies [1366]. All patients with viable smooth muscle on MRI maintained erectile function on clinical follow-up with the non-viable group being offered early prosthesis.
