4.2.4.3.1.1. Shared decision making. The Panel recognises that a shared decision-making approach is paramount when any treatments are proposed but felt particular emphasis should be made for the topic area of surgical treatment for SUI. There are a number of different options available for patients which vary in both efficacy and safety profile. Consequently, the amount of information given to patients considering surgery for SUI is substantial. The Panel would unequivocally advise adherence to the fundamental principles of the shared decision-making process which include: full participation from the patient;delivery of factual information regarding benefits and risks of any particular treatment, if possible adapted to the specific situation of the patient;delivery of information about the experience and expertise of the HCP/institution delivering the treatment, especially for highly specialised procedures such as complex SUI and mesh removal surgery;confirmation that the patient understands the information given;clinician understanding and documenting individual patient preferences;facilitation of deliberation and initial decision-making;patient opportunity to consider and confirm any decisions made;clinician assistance with implementation of the final decision.
