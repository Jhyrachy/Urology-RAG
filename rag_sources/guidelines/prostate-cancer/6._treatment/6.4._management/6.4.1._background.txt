6.4.1. background. 27% 53% patients undergoing rp rt develop rising psa (psa recurrence). whilst metastatic progression universally preceded rising psa levels, physicians must inform patient natural history psa-only recurrence may prolonged measurable psa may necessarily lead clinically apparent metastatic disease. physicians treating patients psa-only recurrence face difficult set decisions attempting delay onset metastatic disease death avoiding overtreating patients whose disease may never affect os qol. emphasised treatment recommendations patients given discussion multi-disciplinary team. 6.4.1.1. psa velocity doubling time various psa kinetics definitions proposed different methods calculation (log transformed not) eligible psas: psa velocity (psav): absolute annual increase serum psa (ng/ml/year);psa doubling time (psa-dt): measures exponential increase serum psa time. prostate-specific antigen velocity simple calculate subtracting initial value final value, dividing time. however, ignoring middle values, psa values accurately taken account. prostate-specific antigen-dt calculated assuming exponential rise serum psa. formula takes account natural logarithm 2 divided slope obtained fitting linear regression natural log psa time . however, many different psa-dt calculations assessed according mathematical formula used included psa values (number, time period, intervals) . example, ‘mskcc’ method calculates regression slope integrating psa values. methods transform psa calculating slope include psa values (different time frames minimal intervals) . o’brien colleagues identified 20 different definitions psav psa-dt demonstrated obtained values could vary widely definitions . however, rules considered psa-dt calculation : least 3 psa measurements required;a minimum time period measurements (4 weeks) preferable due potentialstatistical ‘noise’ psa values obtained close together (this statement bereconsidered case active disease);all included psa values obtained within past twelve months most, reflect current disease activity;psa-dt often mentioned months, weeks active disease. measurements provide additional information compared psa alone [479,888-890]. post-local therapy relapse setting, psa-dt correlated distant progression poorer outcomes salvage treatments . prostate-specific antigen-dt linked metastasis-free- os non-metastatic crpc (nmcrpc) identifies patients high-risk nmcrpc benefit intensified therapy (psa-dt threshold < ten months) .
