8.3. Summary of evidence and recommendations for surveillance following RN or PN or ablative therapies in RCC. Summary of evidenceLEFunctional follow-up after curative treatment for RCC is useful to prevent renal and cardiovascular deterioration.4Oncological follow-up can detect local recurrence or metastatic disease while the patient may still be surgically curable.4After NSS, there is an increased risk of recurrence for larger (> 7 cm) tumours, or when there is a PSM.3Patients undergoing follow-up have a better OS than patients not undergoing follow-up.3Prognostic models provide stratification of RCC risk of recurrence based on TNM and histological features.3In competing-risk models, risk of non-RCC-related death exceeds that of RCC recurrence or related death in low-risk patients.3Life expectancy estimation is feasible and may support counselling of patients on duration of follow-up.4Overall survival is reduced in metastatic RCC patients with symptoms of depression and distress.2a RecommendationsStrength ratingBase follow-up after treatment of localised RCC on the risk of recurrence.StrongBase risk of recurrence stratification on validated subtype-specific models such as the Leibovich Score for clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), or the University of California Los Angeles integrated staging system for non-ccRCC.WeakIntensify follow-up in patients after nephron-sparing surgery for tumours > 7 cm or in patients with a positive surgical margin.WeakConsider curtailing follow-up when the risk of dying from other causes is double that of the RCC recurrence risk.WeakOffer psychological evaluation for all patients diagnosed with RCC to provide timely support for distress, depression, or anxiety.Weak
