study found significant relaxation pfms contraction another study found pfm relaxation training time increased speed relaxation single contraction . evidence paediatric literature, including one rct

dysfunction. mean number voiding episodes significantly increased relaxation training group compared group combined treatment. post-void residual volume voiding time decreased considerably, whereas maximum urine flow increased significantly relaxation group compared combined treatment group . 4.4.4.1.3. clean intermittent self-catheterisation clean intermittent self-catheterisation commonly used

potential patients line good medical practice. people using cisc, cochrane review found evidence one type catheter regimen catheterisation better another . however, recent narrative review suggests that, certain populations, single-use catheters may reduce urethral trauma uti . 4.4.4.1.4. indwelling catheter indwelling urinary catheter may option women failed treatments unable perform cisc. complications include uti, stone formation, urethral damage. suprapubic catheterisation may preferable urethral catheterisation minimise risk urethral trauma pain . 4.4.4.1.5. intravesical electrical stimulation intravesical electrical stimulation (ives) used improve bladder dysfunction stimulating a-delta mechanoreceptor afferents requires intact afferent circuits healthy detrusor muscle. one retrospective study sixteen patients (eleven females) found two-thirds patients weak detrusor prolonged bladder over-distension regained balanced voiding ives due detrusor reinforcement . 4.4.4.2. pharmacological management 4.4.4.2.1. parasympathomimetics theoretical approaches uab pharmacological treatment include direct stimulation detrusor cell muscarinic receptors using parasympathomimetic agents carbachol bethanechol acetylcholinesterase inhibitors distigmine, pyridostigmine neostigmine. sr use parasympathomimetics patients uab included ten rcts (controls typically received placebo treatment). three studies reported significant improvements relative control group, six one even reported significant worsening symptoms. evidence differences individual drugs, specific uses drugs,

bronchospasm, bradycardia) taken account. 4.4.4.2.2. alpha-adrenergic blockers order improve bladder emptying, decreasing outlet resistance sympathetic blockade bladder neck/urethra investigated. one prospective study tamsulosin showed similar improvement terms uroflowmetry parameters (specifically percentage patients good therapeutic response) women boo (39.4%) du (32.7%) . another longitudinal study including fourteen women du showed clinical urodynamic improvements tamsulosin . prospective single-blind rct female patients du compared efficacy alpha-blocker, cholinergic drugs, combination therapy, latter exhibiting best results . 4.4.4.2.3. prostaglandins prostaglandins prokinetic agents promote smooth muscle contraction. prostaglandins e2 f2 used intravesically treat urinary retention surgery. cochrane review showed significant association intravesical prostaglandin successful voiding among postoperative patients urinary retention. however, success rate low (32%) wide 95% ci,
