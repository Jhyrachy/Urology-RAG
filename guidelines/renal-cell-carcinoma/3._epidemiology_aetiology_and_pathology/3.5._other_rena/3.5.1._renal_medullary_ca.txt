3.5.1. Renal medullary carcinoma (SMARCB1-deficient renal medullary carcinoma). Renal medullary carcinoma (RMC) (referred to as SMARCB1-deficient renal medullary carcinoma in the 2022 WHO Classification) is a very rare tumour, comprising < 0.5% of all RCCs [32], predominantly diagnosed in young adults of African ancestry (median age 28 years) with sickle haemoglobinopathies (including sickle cell trait). It has a male predominance of 2:1 and is mainly centrally located with ill-defined borders. Renal medullary carcinoma is one of the most aggressive RCCs [33,34] and most patients (~67%) will present with metastatic disease [33,35]. Even patients who present with seemingly localised disease may develop unequivocal metastases shortly (within weeks) after diagnosis (for treatment see Chapter 7). Apart from the RMC described above, some patients present with identical tumours without haemoglobinopathy. Such tumours have been described as “unclassified RCC with medullary phenotype” [22].
