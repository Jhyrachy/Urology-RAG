9.3. Comparison of different types of grafts. Buccal mucosa is at present the most commonly used graft. A systematic review on anterior urethral strictures reports a urethral patency rates of buccal mucosa of 86.6% with an average follow-up of 31.5 months [518]. Penile skin is another popular graft, especially in uncircumcised men where the foreskin is an abundant source of graft material. In case of LS, Trivedi et al., demonstrated a significantly higher urethral patency rate when using non-genital mucosal grafts for reconstruction (82.6%) compared to genital skin grafts (4%) [519]; therefore, the use of genital skin in LS cases is not indicated. In one RCT (Peeâ€™BuSt trial) comparing buccal mucosa with penile skin as a graft for dorsal onlay augmentation urethroplasty for anterior strictures, no significant difference in outcome could be observed [520]. A systematic review and meta-analysis suggests that BMG augmentented urethroplasty, may be superior to penile skin graft urethroplasty. However, there were a lot of confounding factors, and clear conclusions cannot be made [521]. Lengthy skin grafts (up to 20 cm) can be taken from the foreskin in a spiroid fashion which is clearly more difficult with OMG. The main disadvantage of BMG harvesting is the oral morbidity and because of this morbidity, lingual mucosa has been proposed as alternative. A SR and meta-analysis of comparative studies comparing LMG with BMG (four prospective, two retrospective studies) showed no significant differences in urethral patency rate and overall long-term complication rate [522-524]. These studies revealed that LMG was associated with more difficulties in eating/drinking, speaking, tongue protrusion and dysgeusia [522,523]. In 13.8-20%, speaking problems remained after six months [522,523]. A retrospective study of Xu et al., reported difficulties in tongue movements, numbness over the donor site and speaking difficulties in 6.2%, 4.9% and 2.5% of patients, respectively after twelve months [301]. On the other hand, BMG harvesting provoked more oral tightness which was present in up to 24% of patients after six months [522,523]. Chauhan et al., showed that immediate and early donor site complications were more common in the BMG group, except for bleeding being more common in the LMG group. Numbness (61%), difficulty in chewing (54%), swelling (48%) and articulation (40%) were the most common problems during the first week. Late donor site complications were rare [525]. Pal et al., describes more short-term complications (difficulty in tongue movement and slurring of speech) in the LMG group, compared to the BMG group. Long-term complications (after three months) at the donor site (persistent pain, perioral numbness, tightness of mouth, salivary disturbance, scarring of the cheeks) were only seen in the BMG group [526]. For long strictures, buccal mucosa can be combined with lingual mucosa [301]. The use of lower lip mucosa was described, especially when smaller grafts are needed, and has similar qualities to lingual mucosa. However, a narrative review based on the experience from retrospective series showed that these grafts have a higher post-operative donor site morbidity and can lead to permanent sequelae (persistent discomfort, neurosensory deficits, salivary flow changes and important aesthetic changes) at the donor site, which have not been described with lingual mucosa [527]. Beyond the oral mucosa and penile skin graft, a multitude of other autologous grafts have been described. These include: postauricular skin [510,528], abdominal skin [360], split-thickness mesh graft from the thigh [341], inguinal skin [300] and colonic mucosa [529] (Table 9.2). Manoj et al., only used the postauricular skin when both genital skin and oral mucosa were not usable [528]. Marchal et al., used postauricular skin in addition to oral mucosa to reconstruct lengthy strictures [510]. Meeks et al., reported the use of abdominal skin graft mainly in patients with lengthy strictures where OMG harvesting would be insufficient, in case of prior OMG urethroplasty or if OMG was refused by the patient [360]. Pfalzgraf et al., reported a comparable urethral patency rate for split-thickness mesh graft and BMG (respectively 84 and 83%), but more penile deviation (9% vs. 0%) and lower satisfaction (83.3% vs. 96.7%) with split-thickness mesh graft [341]. Xu et al., used colonic mucosa for lengthy (> 10 cm) strictures. Urethral patency rate was 85.7% but graft harvest requires an abdominal procedure, and 1/35 (2.9%) patient developed a colonic-abdominal fistula [529]. Due to the limited experience with grafts other than oral mucosa and penile skin, they should only be considered if oral mucosa and penile skin are not available, indicated, or desired.
