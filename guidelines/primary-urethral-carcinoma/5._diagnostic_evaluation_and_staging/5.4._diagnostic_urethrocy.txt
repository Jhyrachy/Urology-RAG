5.4. Diagnostic urethrocystoscopy and biopsy. Diagnostic urethrocystoscopy and biopsy enables primary assessment of a urethral tumour in terms of tumour extent, location, and underlying histology [36]. Cystoscopic examination is necessary to exclude the presence of concomitant bladder tumours [40]. A cold-cup biopsy enables accurate tissue retrieval for histological analysis and avoids artificial tissue damage. In patients with larger lesions, transurethral resection (optionally in men under penile blood arrest using a tourniquet) can be performed for histological diagnosis [41]. In patients with suspected UC of the prostatic urethra or ducts, resectoscope loop biopsy of the prostatic urethra (between the five and seven oâ€™clock position from the bladder neck and distally around the area of the verumontanum) can contribute to an improved detection rate [42]. To enable accurate pathological assessment of surgical margins, biopsy sites (proximal/distal end) should be marked and sent together with clinical information to the pathologist. To obtain all relevant information, the collection, handling, and evaluation of biopsy specimen should follow the recommendations provided by the International Collaboration on Cancer Reporting (see Table 4.3) [34].
