5.7. Summary of evidence and recommendations for the diagnosis and staging of Testicular Cancer. Summary of evidenceLEPoor sperm quality is frequently found in TC patients, before and after treatment. Semen preservation is the most cost-effective strategy for fertility preservation.2bSerum tumour markers (AFP, β-hCG and LDH) should be determined before and after orchidectomy and throughout follow-up. They are used for accurate staging, risk stratification, to monitor treatment and to detect relapse.2bFor abdominal staging, CECT has a median sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV and accuracy of 67%, 95%, 87%, 73% and 83%, respectively. Sensitivity decreases and specificity increases with increasing lymph node size.2aFor chest staging, CECT has a median sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV and accuracy of 100%, 93%, 68%, 100% and 93%, respectively.2aMagnetic resonance imaging and CECT are key image modalities for the detection of brain metastasis. Magnetic resonance imaging is far more sensitive than CECT, though it does require expertise.2bFluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography has a limited diagnostic accuracy for staging before chemotherapy.2bThere are no high-level evidence studies supporting screening programs.2bIn testicular sparing surgery, FSE has shown to be reliable and highly concordant with final histopathology.1bThere is no evidence supporting any size criteria for a testicular lesion to be safely followed-up.2bIn patients without risk factors, there is low incidence of contralateral GCNIS and of metachronous GCT.2b RecommendationsStrength ratingDiscuss sperm banking with all men prior to starting treatment for testicular cancer (TC).StrongPerform bilateral testicular ultrasound (US) in all patients with suspicion of TC.StrongPerform physical examination including supraclavicular, cervical, axillar, and inguinal lymph nodes, breast, and testicles.StrongMeasure serum tumour markers both before and after orchidectomy taking into account half-life kinetics.StrongPerform orchidectomy and pathological examination of the testis to confirm the diagnosis and to define the local extension (pathological tumour (pT) category). In a life-threatening situation due to extensive metastasis, commence chemotherapy prior to orchidectomy.StrongPerform contrast enhanced computerised tomography (CECT) scan (chest, abdomen, and pelvis) in patients with a diagnosis of TC. In case of iodine allergy or other limiting factors perform abdominal and pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).StrongPerform MRI of the brain (or brain CECT if not available) in patients with multiple lung metastases, or high beta subunit of human Chorionic Gonadotropin (β-hCG) values, or those in the poor-prognosis International Germ Cell Cancer Collaborative Group (IGCCCG) risk group.StrongDo not use positron emission tomography–computed tomography or bone scan for staging.StrongEncourage patients with TC to perform self-examination and to inform first-degree male relatives of the need for self-examination.WeakDiscuss testis-sparing surgery with frozen section examination in patients with a high likelihood of having a benign testicular tumour which are suitable for enucleation.StrongDiscuss biopsy of the contralateral testis to patients with TC and who are at high-risk for contralateral germ cell neoplasia “in situ”.Strong
