4.4.3. Disease Management. 4.4.3.1. Male anterior urethral injuries 4.4.3.1.1. Immediate exploration and urethral reconstruction This is indicated for penile fracture related injuries [268] and non-life-threatening penetrating injuries [257]. Small lacerations can be repaired by simple closure [241]. Complete ruptures without extensive tissue loss are treated with anastomotic repair [241,242]. Only 2% of cases will develop a urethral stricture after immediate urethral reconstruction for penile fracture [268]. In the case of longer defects or apparent infection (particularly bite wounds), a staged repair with urethral marsupialisation is needed [262]. Penetrating injuries require peri- and post-operative antibiotic treatment [269]. Immediate urethroplasty has been performed in blunt injuries. The long term-outcomes (patency rate, potency rate) of patients treated with immediate urethroplasty is similar to these initially treated with suprapubic diversion and delayed urethroplasty [270]. The main advantage of performing immediate urethroplasty is that this strategy significantly reduces the time to spontaneous voiding from two to six months to three weeks on average [270,271]. Spongiosal contusion and haematoma during immediate urethroplasty will make the operation technically more demanding; therefore, immediate urethroplasty should be performed by a dedicated urethral surgeon [271]. Perforation of the distal urethra during penile prosthesis insertion needs to be repaired over a catheter; in this instance the initial procedure should be abandoned [272]. 4.4.3.1.2. Urinary diversion Blunt anterior urethral injuries are associated with spongiosal contusion. Evaluation of the limits of urethral debridement in the acute phase might be difficult and as a consequence, it is reasonable to start with urinary diversion only [262]. If urinary diversion is performed, the therapeutic options are suprapubic diversion or a trial of early endoscopic re-alignment with transurethral catheterisation [262]; there is conflicting evidence as to which intervention is superior [270,271,273]. A retrospective case series of 44 patients comparing early realignment versus suprapubic tube placement, shows no difference in stricture formation [274]. Urinary diversion is maintained for one to two weeks for partial ruptures and three weeks for complete ruptures [262,273]. A review of 49 Chinese studies (1,015 patients), reported a 57% (range: 0 - 100%) success rate for endoscopic re-alignment of blunt anterior injuries [270]. The wide range in success rate most likely reflects a mix of partial and complete ruptures which was not further specified in the review. For complete ruptures, urinary diversion on its own is unlikely to result in a successful outcome (0 - 25% patency rate) [271,273]. Transurethral or suprapubic urinary diversion are treatment options for iatrogenic or life-threatening penetrating injuries [257,275]. Minor iatrogenic urethral injuries and urethral contusions do not require urinary diversion [3]. 4.4.3.2. Male posterior urethral injuries 4.4.3.2.1. Emergency room management As these injuries are usually associated with other severe injuries, resuscitation and immediate treatment of life-threatening injuries have absolute priority [254]. Penetrating injuries especially have a very high likelihood of associated injuries requiring immediate exploration [192,276]. There is no urgency to treat the urethral injury and urinary diversion is not essential during the first hours after trauma [255]; however, it is preferable to establish early urinary diversion to: monitor urinary output, since this is a valuable sign of the haemodynamic condition and the renal function of the patient;treat symptomatic retention if the patient is still conscious;minimise urinary extravasation and its secondary effects, such as infection and fibrosis [254]. Insertion of a suprapubic catheter is an accepted practice in urgent situations [255,276]. However, insertion of a suprapubic catheter is not without risk, especially in the unstable trauma patient where the bladder is often displaced by a pelvic haematoma or because of poor bladder filling due to haemodynamic shock or concomitant bladder injury. In these circumstances, an attempt at urethral catheterisation can be carried out by experienced personnel. It is extremely unlikely that the gentle passage of a urethral catheter will do any additional damage [254]. If there is any difficulty, a suprapubic catheter should be placed under US guidance or under direct vision, for example, during laparotomy for associated injuries [254]. Suprapubic catheter placement does not increase the risk of infectious complications in patients undergoing internal fixation to stabilise a pelvic fracture [277]. Therefore, the assertion that suprapubic catheter placement would increase the risk of orthopaedic hardware infection and subsequent explantation is not justified [277]. 4.4.3.2.2. Early urethral management (less than six weeks after injury) For partial injuries, urinary diversion (suprapubic or transurethral) is sufficient as these injuries can heal without significant scarring or obstruction [255,257]. A complete injury will not heal, and formation of an obliterated segment is inevitable in case of suprapubic diversion alone [255,257]. To avoid this obliteration and a long period of suprapubic diversion followed by deferred urethroplasty, the urethral ends can be sutured (urethroplasty) or approximated over a transurethral catheter (re-alignment). 4.4.3.2.2.1. Early re-alignment Early re-alignment can be performed when a stable patient is on the operating table for other surgery or as a stand-alone procedure in the absence of concomitant injuries [192,278]. In a partial injury, re-alignment, and transurethral catheterisation avoids extravasation of urine in the surrounding tissues reducing the inflammatory response. In complete injuries, the aim of re-alignment is to correct severe distraction injuries rather than to prevent a stricture [257,279]. Re-alignment can be done by an open or endoscopic technique [279,280]. The open technique is associated with longer operation times, more blood loss and longer hospital stays; as such, endoscopic re-alignment is now preferred [270]. Using a flexible/rigid cystoscope and biplanar fluoroscopy, a guidewire is placed inside the bladder under direct visual control, over this, a catheter is placed. If necessary, two cystoscopes can be used: one retrograde (per urethra) and one antegrade (suprapubic route through the bladder neck) [254]. The duration of catheterisation is three weeks for partial and six weeks for complete ruptures with voiding urethrography upon catheter removal [254]. It is important to avoid traction on the balloon catheter as it can damage the remaining sphincter mechanism at the bladder neck [254]. With contemporary endoscopic re-alignment procedures, stricture formation is reduced to44-49% [279,280] compared to a 89-94% stricture rate with suprapubic diversion [280,281]. There is no evidence that early re-alignment increases the risk of urinary incontinence (4.7-5.8%) or erectile dysfunction (16.7-20.5%) [280,281]. Another potential benefit of early re-alignment is that when a stricture occurs it will be shorter and therefore, easier to treat. For short, non-obliterative strictures following re-alignment, direct vision urethrotomy can be performed. Approximately 50% of strictures after endoscopic re-alignment can be treated endoscopically [279]. However, repetitive endoscopic procedures in case of stricture formation might delay the time to definitive cure and can increase the incidence of adverse events (false passage, abscess formation) [282,283]. In light of this, repetitive endoscopic treatments after failed re-alignment are not recommended; instead, urethroplasty must be performed. A retrospective review found a shorter stricture length after early (open) re-alignment and as a consequence, a tendency for less complex manoeuvres to be needed to allow for a tension-free anastomosis during urethroplasty [284]. On the other hand, another retrospective review, reported an equal stricture length and no greater facilitation of urethroplasty after failed endoscopic re-alignment compared to suprapubic diversion only [282]. The proposed benefit is thus highly questionable. Furthermore, there is conflicting evidence as to whether failed early re-alignment jeopardises the success of definitive urethroplasty [254]. Differences between series in the rates of incontinence, impotence and re-stricture can be explained by differences in patient selection (severe vs. less severe trauma), a mix of partial and complete ruptures, and differences in follow-up duration. Furthermore, these differences make the comparison with other techniques difficult, especially with urethroplasty [184,279]. 4.4.3.2.2.2. Early urethroplasty Immediate urethroplasty within 48 hours after injury is difficult because of poor visualisation and the inability to accurately assess the degree of urethral disruption, due to extensive swelling and ecchymosis, which may result in extensive unjustified urethral debridement. Another problem is the risk of severe bleeding (average 3 L) following entry into the pelvic haematoma [254]. In addition, with high rates of impotence (23%), incontinence (14%) and strictures (54%), urethroplasty within 48-hours is not indicated [254]. Early urethroplasty can be performed after two days and up to six weeks after the initial injury, if associated injuries have been stabilised, the distraction defect is short, the perineum is soft and the patient is able to lie down in the lithotomy position [285,286]. This avoids a long period of suprapubic diversion with its discomfort and complications [285,286]. As the results (complications, stricture recurrence, incontinence, and impotence) are equivalent to delayed urethroplasty [286-288], early urethroplasty might be an option for patients fulfilling the above-mentioned criteria. Lacerations (blunt or penetrating) at the bladder neck and prostatic urethra are a specific entity: they will never heal spontaneously, will cause local cavitation (presenting a source of infection) and compromise the intrinsic sphincter mechanism (with increased risk of urinary incontinence) [256]. They must be reconstructed as soon as possible [257,263,276]. For penetrating injuries with severe lesions to the prostate, prostatectomy (bladder neck sparing) must be performed [276]. 4.4.3.2.3. Deferred management (greater than three months after injury) The standard treatment remains deferred urethroplasty [13,14]. In the case of a complete rupture, treated with an initial period of three months suprapubic diversion, obliteration of the posterior urethra is almost inevitable [255]. Endoscopic treatment of a complete obliteration is not successful [254]. After at least three months of suprapubic diversion, the pelvic haematoma is nearly always resolved, the prostate has descended into a more normal position, the scar tissue has stabilised [285] and the patient is clinically stable and able to lie down in the lithotomy position [262,285]. Associated life-threatening injuries often preclude early management of penetrating membranous urethral injuries. In those cases, suprapubic diversion with delayed urethroplasty is also advised [17,25,27]. Perineal anastomotic repair is the surgical technique of choice, but a combined abdominoperineal approach is necessary in rare cases of concomitant bladder neck injury or recto-urethral fistula [289]. An extensive overview of deferred urethroplasty can be found in the Urethral Strictures Guidelines [290]. 4.4.3.2.4. Iatrogenic posterior injuries Urethral defects during transanal total mesorectal excision were repaired by direct suture repair via a transperineal approach in a small case series (n=32). Despite direct repair, 26% developed complications including urethral stricture, urethral dehiscence, recto-urethral fistula, and recto-perineal fistula. No evidence on other strategies is available [259]. 4.4.3.3. Female urethral injuries Emergency room management of PFUIs in females is the same as in males (section 4.4.3.2.1); however, subsequent management differs. Treatment options are [260]: Early realignment: This is associated with a high stricture and fistula rate.Early repair (less than or equal to seven days): Complication rate is the lowest with early repair; therefore, this strategy is preferred once the patient is haemodynamically stable [257,260].Delayed repair (greater than seven days): Delayed repair often requires complex abdominal or combined abdominal-vaginal reconstruction with elevated risk of urinary incontinence and vaginal stenosis. The approach (vaginal, abdominal or combined) for early repair depends on the location of the injury [260]. Proximal and mid-urethral disruptions require immediate exploration and primary repair using the retropubic and transvaginal routes, respectively, with primary suturing of the urethral ends or urethral laceration. Concomitant vaginal lacerations are repaired (two-layer closure) trans vaginally at the same time [260]. Distal urethral injuries can be left hypospadiac since they do not disrupt the sphincter mechanism, but a concomitant vaginal laceration must be closed [184,264]. In case of urethral injury during synthetic sub-urethral sling insertion, immediate repair is warranted with abandonment of sling insertion [261].
