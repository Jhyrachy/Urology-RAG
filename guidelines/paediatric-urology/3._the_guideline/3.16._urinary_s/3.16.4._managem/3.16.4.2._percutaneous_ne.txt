3.16.4.2. Percutaneous nephrolithotomy. Shockwave lithotripsy is the first choice for treating most renal paediatric stones. However, percutaneous renal surgery should be used for larger and complex stones. Pre-operative evaluation, indication and surgical technique are similar in children and adults. In most cases, percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) is used as monotherapy, but is also used as an adjunctive procedure to other therapies. The use of adult-sized instruments, in association with an increased number of tracts and sheath size, seems to increase blood loss. However, the development of small-calibre instruments (miniPCNL, ultraminiPCNL, superminiPCNL and microperc) means that PCNL can be used in children. Miniaturised PCNL has several advantages compared to standard PCNL, such as a smaller skin incision, single-step dilation and sheath placement, good working access for paediatric instruments, variable length, and lower cost [1136-1138]. As monotherapy, PCNL is considerably effective and safe. The reported stone-free rates in the recent literature are between 86.9% and 98.5% after a single session. These rates increase with adjunctive measures, such as second-look PCNL, SWL and URS. Even in complete staghorn cases, a clearance rate of 89% has been achieved following a single session [1139-1144]. The mean post-operative hospital stay is between one to four days and is much shorter than open surgery [1145]. The less invasive nature of this technique has made it superior to open surgery for treating renal stones in children [1146-1153]. The most frequently reported complications of PCNL in children are bleeding, post-operative fever or infection, and persistent urinary leakage. Bleeding requiring transfusion is reported in less than 10% [1149,1152,1154-1157] and is closely associated with stone burden, operative time, sheath size and the number of tracts [1149,1150,1158]. In recent studies, post-operative infectious complications, such as fever with or without documented UTI, are reported as less than 15% [1149,1152,1154,1155,1157,1159] and the origin of fever is not always found to be the infection. Due to the smaller size of the probes, laser energy is easier to use in smaller instruments and is more useful for paediatric cases [1139,1160-1162]. Using high power laser (> 40 W) during PCNL is feasible and may be helpful in the treatment of staghorn stones [1163], but it should be kept in mind, that increased temperatures inside the smaller paediatric kidney might lead to tissue damage, which has been shown in simulation models [1164]. With the availability of smaller size instruments, miniaturised PCNL (‘miniperc’) through a 13F or 14F sheath [1138,1159,1165] as well as ultramini-PCNL (UMP) through 12F sheaths [1166] have become possible, with decreased transfusion rates [1159]. The mini- and supermini- PCNL (SMP) were shown to have higher efficacy with low complication rates (< Clavien grade 3b) which were deemed to be a safe alternative to SWL by some authors [1146,1167]. In this study, 108 children under 12 years old with single stone (10-20mm) in the renal pelvis or calyces were randomised into two groups; either miniPCNL or SWL. Stone-free rate (SFR) after single session was significantly higher for PCNL (88.9%) compared to SWL (55.6%) [1146]. After second and third sessions, SWL success increased to 88.8% [1168]. The complication rates were 22.2% in PCNL and 14.8% in SWL without statistical significance. The SMP was shown to be advantageous over mini-PCNL in terms of complications with similar stone-free rates [1168,1169]. This miniaturisation has been further developed into the technique of ‘micro-perc’ using a 4.85F ‘all-seeing needle’. This technique enables the stone to be fragmented by a laser in situ and left for spontaneous passage [1170]. A study revealed that microperc provides a similar SFR with similar complication rates and a lower additional treatment rate compared with SWL in the treatment of kidney stone disease in children [1171]. For stones 10-20 mm, micro-PCNL was shown to have comparable results, with less bleeding, compared to mini-PCNL [1147] and similar outcomes with less anaesthetic sessions compared to RIRS [1153]. As experience has accumulated in adult cases, new approaches have started to be applied in children, including tubeless PCNL. This technique has been used in uncomplicated surgery for stones < 2 cm, with patients left either with an indwelling catheter or double J stent in the ureter [1156,1172] or totally tubeless [1173]. Moreover, use of US for establishment of access is gaining popularity [1148,1151,1174]. Traditionally, PCNL in children is performed in prone position. Another trend in the literature is the performance of PCNL in flank-free modified supine position in children [1174,1175]. The proposed advantages are shorter operative time and enabling a simultaneous ureteroscopic procedure without changing the position of the patient. In a recent study, 55 paediatric patients with kidney stones who underwent UMP were randomised into two groups; flank-free modified supine position (FFMS) versus prone position. Stone free rates and complications rates were similar but the operative time was found to be shorter for supine position [1176]. For post-operative pain management, two randomised controlled trials showed that intercostal nerve block or erector spinae bloc were shown to provide effective post-operative analgesia in paediatric patients [1177,1178].
