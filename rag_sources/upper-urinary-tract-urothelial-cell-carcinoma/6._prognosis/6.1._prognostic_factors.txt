however, high quality validation lacking. 6.1.2.2. tumour location, multifocality, size hydronephrosis 6.1.2.2.1. multifocality approximately 7-42% utuc patients reported multifocal tumours [153-157]. patients multifocal tumours likely harbour advanced tumour stage worse prognosis despite treatment rnu [153-157]. however, multifocal tumours also good prognosis present setting otherwise low-risk utuc. important note definition multifocality varies among studies. studies consider number lesions , others focus tumour location (i.e., renal pelvis ureter) [153-155,157]. taken together, tumour multifocality alone insufficient risk stratification, combination factors needed determine whether kidney-sparing surgery safe option. patients categorised high-risk utuc tumour multifocality present accompanied high risk factors (see figure 6.1). 6.1.2.2.2. hydroureteronephrosis hydroureteronephrosis linked advanced disease poor prognosis patients treated rnu . recent meta-analysis 22 studies involving 7,542 patients found pre-operative hydroureteronephrosis significantly associated ureteral tumour location, advanced tumour stage, lymph node metastasis . addition, pre-operative hydroureteronephrosis independently associated worse overall, cancer-specific, disease-free survival, intravesical recurrence . important note low-risk utuc patients may exhibit hydroureteronephrosis example pta low-grade tumour obstructing ureter. taken together, like tumour multifocality, presence hydroureteronephrosis alone insufficient risk stratification, combination factors needed determine whether kidney-sparing surgery safe option. patients categorised high-risk utuc pre-operative hydroureteronephrosis present accompanied high risk factors (see figure 6.1). 6.1.2.2.3. tumour size increasing tumour size linked higher risk muscle-invasive non-organ-confined disease ureteral renal pelvis utuc cases . recent meta-analysis 32,292 patients confirmed larger tumours significantly associated worse overall, cancer-specific, disease-free survival, well intravesical recurrence . renal pelvis utuc, median tumour size ranges 3.5 4.0 cm, 1 cm increase tumour size elevates risk harbouring muscle-invasive disease rnu 1.25-fold . recent multi-institutional study 932 patients suggested 2 cm tumour size serves optimal threshold identifying high-risk patients (> pt2 utuc) . however, measuring tumour size lacks standardisation, leading inter-assessor variability. taken together, like tumour multifocality hydroureteronephrosis, tumour size alone insufficient risk stratification, combination factors needed determine whether kidney-sparing surgery safe option. therefore, similar tumour multifocality hydroureteronephrosis, tumour size alone dictate therapeutic decisions. patients categorised high-risk utuc tumour size exceeds 2 cm accompanied high risk factors (see figure 6.1). 6.1.2.3. pathological subtypes pathological subtypes associated worse css overall survival (os) . studied subtypes micropapillary , squamous sarcomatoid , consistently associated locally-advanced disease worse outcome . patients harbouring pathological subtypes proposed rnu shared-decision process due higher risk progression. 6.1.2.4. lymph node involvement patients nodal metastasis experience poor survival surgery . lymph node density (cut-off 30%) extranodal extension powerful predictors survival outcomes n+ utuc [166-168]. lymph node dissection (lnd) performed time rnu allows optimal tumour staging, although curative role remains controversial [167,169-172]. 6.1.2.5. lymphovascular invasion lymphovascular invasion (lvi) present approximately 20% invasive utucs independent predictor survival [173-175]. lymphovascular invasion status specifically reported pathological reports utuc specimens . 6.1.2.6. surgical margins positive soft tissue surgical margin associated higher risk disease recurrence rnu. pathologists look report positive margins level ureteral transection, bladder cuff, around tumour . 6.1.2.7. pathological factors extensive tumour necrosis (> 10% tumour area) independent prognostic predictor patients undergo rnu . neoadjuvant treatment given, pathological downstaging associated better os . architecture utuc, determined pathological examination rnu specimens, also strong prognosticator sessile growth pattern associated worse outcome [182-184]. concomitant cis organ-confined utuc history bladder cis associated higher risk recurrence cancer-specific mortality . macroscopic infiltration invasion peri-pelvic adipose tissue confers higher risk disease recurrence rnu compared microscopic infiltration renal parenchyma . 6.1.3. molecular markers rarity utuc, main limitations molecular studies retrospective design and, studies, small sample size. none investigated markers validated support introduction daily clinical decision making .
