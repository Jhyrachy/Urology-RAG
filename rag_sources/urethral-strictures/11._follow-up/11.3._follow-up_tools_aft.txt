11.3. follow-up tools urethral surgery. 11.3.1. diagnostic tools follow-up urethral surgery 11.3.1.1. calibration follow-up urethral surgery difference calibration urethral dilatation usually subjective soft strictures may dilated calibration ; therefore, urethral calibration used caution follow-up urethroplasty. dedicated calibration bougies used dilatators. 11.3.1.2. urethrocystoscopy follow-up urethral surgery urethrocystoscopy considered useful tool confirm presence absence recurrent stricture , 35% patients re-strictures remain asymptomatic . also, cystoscope could measure calibrate strictured lumen, bearing mind commonly used endoscopes: 15.7 fr (5 mm diameter) 17.3 fr (5.5 mm diameter) . urethrocystoscopy allows differentiation recurrences diaphragm/cross-bridging – responding simple intervention, significant urethral restrictures – requiring repeated interventions redo surgeries . endoscopic assessment three months anterior urethroplasty predict risk re-intervention one year. compared normal endoscopy, large calibre (> 17 fr) restrictures hr 3.1 (1.35-7.29) repeat intervention small calibre (< 17 fr) restrictures 23.7 hr (12.44-45.15) adjusted age, stricture length, location, aetiology . main problem using urethrocystoscopy routine follow-up low compliance patients 54% patients underwent endoscopy one year urethroplasty, even part study protocol . 11.3.1.3. retrograde urethrogram voiding cystourethrogram follow-up urethral surgery retrograde urethrogram combined vcug commonly used confirm suspected recurrence part routine protocol assess post-operative urethral patency . 11.3.1.4. urethral ultrasound – sonourethrography follow-up urethral surgery use sug follow-up tool common. would reliable tool diagnostic recurrent strictures . 11.3.2. screening tools follow-up urethral surgery tools used assess whether suspicion stricture recurrence need subsequent diagnostic evaluation (see section 5. diagnostic evaluation). 11.3.2.1. flow-rate analysis follow-up urethral surgery evaluating qmax commonest follow-up tool. different cut-off points qmax 15 ml/s 12 ml/s suggested consider intervention failure trigger confirmatory test recurrence . clear threshold, 19% patients qmax < 14 ml/s would still patent urethra, allowing passage 15 fr cystoscope . flow rates may affected operator error, bpo/luts, bladder dysfunction, variations bladder capacity. limitations uroflowmetry include need minimum voided volume 125-150 ml reach voided flow rate reliably predicts abnormality . even controlled settings, percentage patients adequate pre- post-operative uroflowmetry analysis 31% . comparing pre- post-operative qmax levels suggested, difference qmax 10 ml/s less found reliable screen tool recurrence (sensitivity 92%, specificity 78%). measure also strong reproducibility (r=0.52) . unfortunately, improvement urethroplasty significantly different age groups, less 10 ml/s average change 65 years old, probably affected bpo and/or bladder dysfunction . another parameter consider shape voiding curve, recording flat (obstructed) bell-shaped . obstructive voiding curve demonstrated 93% sensitivity predict recurrent strictures, combination urinary symptoms obstructive voiding curve achieved 99% sensitivity 99% npv . 11.3.2.2. post-void residual ultrasound measure follow-up urethral surgery post-void residual us measure significantly increased patients recurrent strictures compared without recurrences . unfortunately, pvr measurement affected abdominal ascites, bladder diverticula and/or poor bladder function , studies reporting inconsistent correlation obstruction presence bpo. also, us measures pvr user dependent, showing high interobserver variability. combined tests – uroflowmetry, ipss, sug – pvr achieves adequate predictive values , currently literature support solo use, assess urethral stricture recurrence . 11.3.2.3. symptom questionnaires follow-up urethral surgery ipss questionnaire, despite designed bpo, showed significant improvement successful urethroplasty inverse significant correlation qmax . mean improvement ipss isaround -11 points (range -19 -5) . table 11.2: post-urethroplasty changes ipss values authornmean pre-operative valuemean post-operative valuechangesignificancymorey af et al.1998 5026.94.4nrp < 0.0001delong j et al.2013 110nrnr-11 (iqr -19 - -5)p < 0.001maciejewski cc et al. 2017 9418.7 (+/- 9)5.8 (+/- 5)nrp < 0.0001 n = number patients;
