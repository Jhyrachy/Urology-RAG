4.1. Staging. The 2016 Tumour, Node, Metastasis (TNM) classification of the International Union Against Cancer (UICC) is recommended to assess the anatomical extent of the disease (Table 1) [28]. Table 1: TNM classification for testicular cancer (adapted from UICC, 2016, 8th edn.) [28] TNM classification for testicular cancerpT - Primary Tumour1pTXPrimary tumour cannot be assessed (see note1)pT0No evidence of primary tumour (e.g., histological scar in testis)pTisIntratubular germ cell neoplasia (carcinoma in situ)+pT1Tumour limited to testis and epididymis without vascular/lymphatic invasion; tumour may invade tunica albuginea but not tunica vaginalis*pT2Tumour limited to testis and epididymis with vascular/lymphatic invasion, or tumour extending through tunica albuginea with involvement of tunica vaginalis**pT3Tumour invades spermatic cord with or without vascular/lymphatic invasion**pT4Tumour invades scrotum with or without vascular/lymphatic invasionN - Regional Lymph Nodes – ClinicalNXRegional lymph nodes cannot be assessedN0No regional lymph node metastasisN1Metastasis with a lymph node mass 2 cm or less in greatest dimension or multiple lymph nodes, none more than 2 cm in greatest dimensionN2Metastasis with a lymph node mass more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm in greatest dimension; or more than 5 nodes positive, none more than 5 cm; or evidence of extranodal extension of tumourN3Metastasis with a lymph node mass more than 5 cm in greatest dimensionPn - Regional Lymph Nodes – PathologicalpNXRegional lymph nodes cannot be assessedpN0No regional lymph node metastasispN1Metastasis with a lymph node mass 2 cm or less in greatest dimension and 5 or fewerpositive nodes, none more than 2 cm in greatest dimensionpN2Metastasis with a lymph node mass more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm in greatest dimension; or more than 5 nodes positive, none more than 5 cm; or evidence of extranodal extension of tumourpN3Metastasis with a lymph node mass more than 5 cm in greatest dimensionM - Distant MetastasisMXDistant metastasis cannot be assessedM0No distant metastasisM1Distant metastasis **M1a Non-regional lymph node(s) or lung metastasisM1b Distant metastasis other than non-regional lymph nodes and lungS - Serum Tumour Markers (Pre-chemotherapy)SXSerum marker studies not available or not performedS0Serum marker study levels within normal limitsLDH (U/l)hCG (mIU/mL)AFP (ng/mL)S1< 1.5 x N and< 5,000 and< 1,000S21.5-10 x N or5,000-50,000 or1,000-10,000S3> 10 x N or> 50,000 or> 10,000 N indicates the upper limit of normal.LDH = lactate dehydrogenase; hCG = human chorionic gonadotrophin; AFP = alpha-fetoprotein.1 Except for pTis and pT4, where radical orchidectomy is not always necessary for classification purposes, the extent of the primary tumour is assessed in the radical orchidectomy specimen; see pT. In other circumstances, TX is used if no radical orchidectomy has been performed.+ The current “Carcinoma in situ” nomenclature is replaced by GCNIS.* AJCC eighth edition subdivides T1 Pure Seminoma by T1a and T1b depending on size no greater than 3 cm or greater than 3 cm in greatest dimension [29]** AJCC eighth edition considers hilar soft tissue invasion and epididymal invasion as pT2, while the discontinuous involvement of the spermatic cord is considered as pM1 [29]
