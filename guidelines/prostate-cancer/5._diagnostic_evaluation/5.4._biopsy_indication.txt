5.4. Biopsy indication. 5.4.1. Risk assessment before MRI and biopsy An elevated risk of significant PCa is established based on one or more of the primary diagnostic tools applied, such as PSA level, DRE, or primary imaging. While in the classic diagnostic algorithm the indication for biopsy was generally solely based on a PSA-threshold or abnormal DRE, different two- or three-tier sequential / conditional pathways are now available to indicate prostate biopsy, such as imaging and/or biomarkers. These can be combined and/or sequenced into two or multiple-tier conditional diagnostic pathways (e.g. PSA -> MRI, PSA -> risk calculator, PSA -> risk calculator -> MRI, etc). Age, co-morbidity, life expectancy, and therapeutic consequences should also be considered and discussed beforehand [278]. The chosen diagnostic algorithm may be elected based on availability, expertise, and resources. The different approaches impact cancer detection rates, number of (un)necessary biopsies, number of patient visits, and option of targeted biopsies. The elected strategy may also be decided based on prevalence of disease in men entering the pathway (e.g. screening versus clinical symptoms). Different sequences and combinations of these tools, lead to different rates of biopsy indications, detection rates of insignificant PCa, and significant PCa, but also on the burden and costs of the diagnostic algorithm [279]. 5.4.1.1. Risk calculators assessing the risk of csPCa At different steps during the diagnostic process, available parameters may be combined into risk calculators to optimise risk-assessment of csPCa. Validation and adaption to the target population are important issues before use. Risk calculators, combining clinical data (age, DRE findings, PSA level, prostate volume, etc.) may be useful in helping to determine (on an individual basis) what the potential risk of cancer may be, thereby improving the balance of the cancer detection rates and number of biopsies [280]. Several tools developed from cohort studies are available including (among others) the calculator derived from the ERSPC cohort (http://www.prostatecancer-riskcalculator.com/seven-prostate-cancer-risk-calculators) that has been updated by incorporating the 2014 ISUP Pathology Gleason Grading and Cribriform growth [150], and the one derived from the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) cohort (PCPTRC 2.0 https://riskcalc.org/PCPTRC/). However, calculators are limited by their dependency on disease prevalence. All calculators show miscalibration when tested in populations with a different prevalence than that of the training population of the model. Recalibrations taking into account the local prevalence are possible, but this approach is difficult in routine as the local prevalence is difficult to estimate and may change over time. 5.4.1.2. Using risk-stratification to avoid Magnetic resonance imaging scans and biopsy procedures A retrospective analysis including 200 men from a prospective database of patients who underwent MRI and combined systematic and targeted biopsy showed that upfront use of the Rotterdam Prostate Cancer Risk Calculator would have avoided MRI and biopsy in 73 men (37%). Of these 73 men, ten had ISUP grade group 1 cancer and 4 had ISUP grade group ≥ 2 cancer [281]. A prospective multi-centre study evaluated several diagnostic pathways in 545 biopsy-naive men who underwent MRI and systematic and targeted biopsy. Using a PHI threshold of > 30 to perform MRI and biopsy would have avoided MRI and biopsy in 25% of men at the cost of missing 8% of the ISUP grade group ≥ 2 cancers [282]. Another prospective multi-centre trial including 532 men (with or without history of prostate biopsy) showed that using a threshold of ≥ 10% for the Stockholm3 test to perform MRI and biopsy would have avoided MRI and biopsy in 38% of men at the cost of missing 8% of ISUP grade group ≥ 2 cancers [207]. Finally, a risk calculator developed on 1,486 men who underwent MRI and biopsy was externally validated on a cohort of 946 men from two institutions; using a risk threshold that provided 95% sensitivity in the development cohort could have avoided 22% of the MRI scans in the validation cohort while missing 5% of csPCa [283]. 5.4.2. MRI based indication for biopsy 5.4.2.1. MRI as a triage test for biopsy (‘MRI pathway’) Owing to its high sensitivity, MRI showed an excellent NPV for ruling out the presence of csPCa not only at subsequent biopsy [284], but also after four years of follow-up [285]. The diagnostic yield and number of biopsy procedures potentially avoided by the ‘MR pathway’ (in which only patients with positive MRI undergo biopsy) depends on the Likert/PI-RADS threshold used to define a positive MRI. In pooled studies on biopsy-naive patients and patients with prior negative biopsies, a Likert/PI-RADS threshold of ≥ 3 would have avoided 30% (95% CI: 23–38) of all biopsy procedures while missing 11% (95% CI: 6–18) of all detected ISUP grade group ≥ 2 cancers (relative percentage) [186]. Increasing the threshold to ≥ 4 would have avoided 59% (95% CI: 43–78) of all biopsy procedures while missing 28% (95% CI: 14–48) of all detected ISUP grade group ≥ 2 cancers [186]. Of note, the percentages of negative MRI (Likert/PI-RADS score ≤ 2) may show substantial variability among series. In the PRECISION, MRI-FIRST and 4M trials were 21.1%, 28.9% and 49%, with related ISUP grade group ≥ 2 cancer prevalence of 27.7% (23.7–32.6), 37.5% (31.4–43.8), and 30% (ND) respectively [121,189,190]. In the MR PROPER trial, a prospective, multi-centre, non-randomised opportunistic early detection setting (PSA > 3 ng/mL), comparable rates of ISUP grade group ≥ 2 cancer detection (24% vs. 25%) were obtained by the MRI pathway and by a strategy indicating systematic biopsy based on a risk calculator. However, the MRI pathway avoided biopsy in more men as compared to the diagnostic pathway using a risk calculator (559/1015, 55% vs. 403/950, 42%; difference -13%, 95% 27 CI: -17% to -8.3%; p < 0.01); it also detected less ISUP grade group 1 cancers (84/1015, 8.3% vs. 121/950, 13%; difference 4.5%, 95% CI: 1.8–7.2%; p < 0.01) [286]. 5.4.2.2. Combining MRI and PSA Density Prostate-specific antigen density (PSA-D) may help refine the risk of csPCa in patients undergoing MRI as PSA-D and the PI-RADS score are significant independent predictors of csPCa at biopsy [287,288]. Combinations of PSA-D and MRI have been explored [289,290], showing guidance in biopsy-decisions whilst safely avoiding redundant biopsy testing and detection of insignificant PCa. In a meta-analysis of eight studies, pooled MRI NPV for ISUP grade group ≥ 2 cancer was 84% (95% CI: 81–87) in the whole cohort, 83% (95% CI: 80–84) in biopsy-naive men and 88% (95% CI: 85–91) in men with prior negative biopsies. In the subgroup of patients with PSA-D < 0.15 ng/mL/cc, NPV increased to respectively 90% (95% CI: 87–93), 89% (95% CI: 83–93) and 94% (95% CI: 91–97) [291]. In contrast, the risk of ISUP grade group ≥ 2 cancer is as high as 27–40% in patients with negative MRI and PSA-D > 0.15–0.20 ng/mL/cc [189,288,292-294]. Based on a meta-analysis of > 3,000 biopsy-naive men, a risk-adapted data table of csPCa was developed, linking PI-RADS score (1-2, 3, and 4-5) to PSA-D categories (< 0.10, 0.10–0.15, 0.15–0.20 and > 0.20 ng/mL) (Table 5.4) [289]. This risk-adapted matrix table may guide the decision to perform a biopsy. In a multi-centre retrospective cohort of 1476 men with PIRADS 3 lesions and a prevalence of 18.5% of ISUP grade group ≥ 2 cancer, age, prior negative biopsy and PSA-D were significant independent predictors of the presence of ISUP grade group ≥ 2 cancer at subsequent systematic and targeted biopsy. Applying a PSA-D cut-off of 0.15 ng/mL/cc, 817 biopsy procedures (58.4%) would have been avoided at the cost of missing ISUP grade group ≥ 2 cancer in 91 men (6.5%); ISUP grade group 1 cancer would not have been detected in 115 men (8.2%) [295]. Two studies provided follow-up data for patients with PI-RADS scores of 1-3 and PSA-D <0.15 ng/ml/cc for whom biopsy was omitted. The cumulative incidence of ISUP grade group ≥ 2 cancer detection was 1.3% at two years [296] and 3.2% at 36 months [297].

Risk calculators incorporating MRI finding Several groups have developed comprehensive risk calculators which combine MRI findings with simple clinical data as a tool to predict subsequent biopsy results [298]. Some calculators underwent external validation with good results both in terms of discrimination and clinical utility and tended to outperform risk calculators not incorporating MRI findings [299-302]. However, their use is hindered by their miscalibration due to prevalence dependency (see section 5.4.1.1). 5.4.2.4. MRI in screening protocols The inclusion of MRI may improve the diagnostic algorithm after a screening PSA, as it reduces the number of men that undergo biopsies while detecting more high-grade and less low-grade PCa [179,303,304]. The Stockholm-3 (STHLM3) screening trial randomised men with a PSA > 3 ng/mL between standard biopsies (10–12 cores) or MRI and standard plus targeted biopsies in the presence of a suspicious MRI. The percentage of men that underwent prostate biopsies in the standard group was double that of the MRI group. In this non-inferiority trial, the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis found 18% and 21% ISUP grade group ≥2 cancer and 12% and 4% ISUP grade group 1 cancer in the standard and the MRI group, respectively [304]. In the GÖTEBORG-2 screening trial, 37,887 men between 50 and 60 years of age were invited to undergo regular PSA screening [305]. Participants with a PSA level above 3 ng/mL were randomly allocated to MRI and combined systematic- and targeted biopsy (reference group) or to MRI and targeted biopsy only in case of PI-RADS ≥ 3 lesions (experimental group). In the experimental group, the detection rate of ISUP grade group 1 cancers was reduced by half (detection ratio: 0.46, 95% CI: 0.33–0.64, p < 0.001); that of ISUP grade group ≥ 2 cancers was lower but not significantly different (detection ratio: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.60 to 1.1). In the reference group, ten of the 68 men with ISUP grade group ≥ 2 cancer were diagnosed by systematic biopsy only. All these ten patients were of intermediate risk. Thus, in a screening setting, the ‘MRI pathway’ may reduce the risk of over-diagnosis by half, at the cost of delaying detection of intermediate-risk tumours in a small percentage of patients. However, these good results were obtained at a single academic centre with double reading of the MRI, which may limit their generalisability in less experienced centres (see Sections 5.5.4). The IP1-PROSTAGRAM study (PSA > 3 ng/mL; MRI PIRADS [Prostate Imaging – Reporting and Data System] > 2), tested MRI as the initial screening test, showed highest detection of csPCa for MRI compared to a PSA threshold followed by transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate (TRUS) biopsy in a population screening setting, with similar rates of biopsy and insignificant cancer [179]. This study proposed a pathway that combines PSA >=1 ng/ml and MRI score >=4, maintaining the detection of grade group ≥2 cancers while recommending fewer men for biopsies, as the preferred strategy to evaluate in future studies at the first screening round [306].
