3.2. Classification of stones. Urinary stones can be classified according to size, location, X-ray characteristics, aetiology of formation, composition, and risk of recurrence [2,9,32]. 3.2.1. Stone size Stone size can be reported in a single, two or three dimensions. Currently, the guidelines still use the linear measurement of cumulative stone diameter to stratify stones in < 5 mm, 5-10 mm, 10-20 mm, and > 20 mm for use in the treatment algorithm. 3.2.2. Stone location Stones can be classified according to anatomical position: upper, middle, or lower calyx; renal pelvis; upper, middle, or distal ureter; and urinary bladder. 3.2.3. X-ray characteristics Stones can be classified according to plain X-ray appearance [kidney-ureter-bladder (KUB) radiography] (Table 3.7), which varies according to mineral composition [35]. Non-contrast-enhanced computed tomography (NCCT) can be used to classify stones according to density, inner structure, and composition, which can affect treatment decisions (Section 3.3) [35,36].
