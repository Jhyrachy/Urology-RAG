3.13.4.6. bladder augmentation. patients conservative treatment including onabotulinum toxin (for indication see 3.12.4.3) fails keep low-pressure reservoir good capacity compliance, bladder augmentation offered. augmentation, ileal colonic segments used . gastric segments rarely used due associated complications like haematuria-dysuria syndrome well secondary malignancies, arise earlier intestinal segments [817-820]. enterocystoplasty increases bladder capacity, reduces storage pressure improve uut drainage . good socially acceptable continence rate achieved without additional bladder outlet procedures . those, able perform cic urethra, continent cutaneous channel offered. one recent study 10 patients showed thoracic epidural analgesia appears safe effective opioid sparing option assist postoperative pain management following lower urinary tract reconstruction . surgical complications revision rate group patients high. 30-day event rate american college surgeonsâ€™ national surgical quality database approximately 30% (23-33%) re-operation rate short time period 13% . patients long-life expectancy complication rate clearly increases follow-up period . ten-year cumulative complication incidence paediatric health information system showed rate bladder rupture 6.4%, small bowel obstruction 10.3%, bladder stones 36%, pyelonephritis third patients re-augmentation rate 13% . bladder perforation, one worst complications, occurs 3-13% . rate vp-shunt infections gastrointestinal urological procedures ranges 0-22%. recent study, bowel preparation seems significant influence infection rate (10.5% vs. 8.3%) . surgical complications must considered; also metabolic complications consequences incorporating bowel segments taken account, imbalance acid base balance, decrease vitamin b12 levels loss bone density. stool frequency increase well diarrhoea exclusion bowel segments last, least, patients lifelong increased risk develop secondary malignancies . therefore, lifelong follow-up patients required including physical examination, us, blood gas analysis, (ph base excess), renal function vitamin b12 ileum used. endoscopic evaluation starting ten years augmentation cost-effective , may prevent advanced cancer. woodhouse et al. recommend cystoscopy within first fifteen years surgery . real value annual cystoscopic evaluation proven study. urodynamic studies bladder augmentation indicated, upper tract dilatation and/or incontinence operation improved . adverse effects intestinal cystoplasties avoided use ureterocystoplasty. combination small contracted bladder, associated severe dilation ureter non-functioning kidney quite rare. technique first described 1973 eckstein ; success rate depends patient selection re-augmentation rate reach 73% . auto-augmentation partial detrusorectomy detrusormyotomy creating diverticulum avoids metabolic complications use intestinal segments. reports conflicting, therefore, may used selected cases [840-843]. successful outcome, pre-operative bladder capacity 75-80% expected volume seems necessary . seromuscular cystoplasty also proven successful standard augmentation intestine . tissue engineering, even successful vitro animal models, reach results using intestinal segments higher complication rate . therefore, alternatives bladder augmentation considered experimental used controlled trials.
