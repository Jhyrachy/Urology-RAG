two main types immunological reactions distinguished, t-cell mediated rejections (tcmr) antibody-mediated rejections (abmr) [244,360-362,365]. antibody-mediated rejection tcmr may diagnosed together, called mixed acute rejection. antibody-mediated rejection may occur hyperacute rejection (har), active rejection chronic rejection. chronic abmr considered one leading causes late graft loss. ultimate

treatment abmr relies mainly retrospective studies empirical treatment guidelines . consensus important classify clinical histological phenotype rejection order make adequate treatment decisions . important clinical factors time rejection (early acute < 30 days posttransplant vs. late), preformed vs. de novo donor-specific antibodies (dsa), histology (active vs. chronic rejection). active abmr due pre-existing dsa treatment steroid bolus (at least three days 500 mg/day) combination intravenous immunoglobulin (ivig) plasmapheresis immune-adsorption recommended. intravenous immunoglobulin (ivig) [244,360,371-376] may modulate and/or suppress antibody production. intravenous immunoglobulin alone seems insufficient effective treatment ivig used today multimodal regimen. dosages vary widely 0.2-2.0 g/kg bodyweight, comparative studies (e.g. dose optimal concomitant immunosuppression) published. retrospective prospective case series clearly suggest efficacy antibody removal using plasmapheresis immune-adsorption columns [244,360,371-376], although details procedures vary widely. adjunctive therapies complement inhibitors, rituximab splenectomy might considered severe early acute cases. despite controversial data utility anti-cd20 antibody [244,345,360,371-376], rituximab may also considered adjunctive therapy late active abmr according expert consensus. although t-cell depleting agents atg appear limited value frequently used mixed acute rejection . however, retrospective series suggests aggravated toxicity, rituximab combined atg , steroids . furthermore, many centres optimise maintenance therapy mycophenolate steroids sufficient tacrolimus trough levels achieved [244,360,371-373,376]. chronic amr due pre-existent dsa specific treatment recommendations

addressed managed accordingly. histology shows active abmr plasmapheresis, rituximab ivig considered potential adjunctive agents without good evidence clinical trials. biopsy demonstrates pure chronic abmr special treatment recommended due lack convincing data, except ivig potential treatment option without firm evidence. treatment chronic abmr appears less successful . summary, several regimens
