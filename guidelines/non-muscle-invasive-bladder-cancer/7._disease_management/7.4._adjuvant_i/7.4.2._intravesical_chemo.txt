7.4.2. Intravesical chemotherapy. 7.4.2.1. A single, immediate, post-operative intravesical instillation of chemotherapy Immediate single instillation (SI) has been shown to act by destroying circulating tumour cells after TURB, and by an ablative effect on residual tumour cells at the resection site and on small overlooked tumours [264-267]. Four large meta-analyses comprising 1,476 to 3,103 patients have consistently shown that after TURB, SI significantly reduces the recurrence rate compared to TURB alone [268-271]. In a systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis of 2,278 eligible patients [268], SI reduced the 5-year recurrence rate by 14%, from 59% to 45%. Only patients with primary tumours or intermediate-risk recurrent tumours with a prior recurrence rate of < 1 recurrence/year and those with a 2006 EORTC recurrence score < 5 benefited from SI. In patients with a 2006 EORTC recurrence score > 5 and/or patients with a prior recurrence rate of > 1 recurrence per year, SI was not effective as a single adjuvant treatment. No randomised comparisons of individual drugs have been conducted [268-271]. Single instillation with mitomycin C (MMC), epirubicin or pirarubicin [268], as well as gemcitabine [271], have all shown to lower the intravesical recurrence rate. Single instillation with gemcitabine was superior to saline in a RCT with approximately 200 patients per arm with remarkably low toxicity rates [272]. These findings are in contrast with a previous study, which, however, used a shorter instillation time [273]. In the Böhle et al., study, continuous saline irrigation was used for 24 hours post-operatively in both arms, which could explain the low recurrence rate in the control arm [273]. Prevention of tumour cell implantation should be initiated within the first few hours after TURB. After that, tumour cells are firmly implanted and are covered by the extracellular matrix [264,274-276]. In all SI studies, the instillation was administered within 24 hours. Two RCTs found no overall impact of SI with apaziquone, a bio reductive prodrug similar to MMC; in contrast, a post-hoc analysis did find a reduction of recurrence risk in patients receiving apaziquone within 90 minutes following TURB [277]. To maximise the efficacy of SI, one should devise flexible practices that allow the instillation to be given as soon as possible after TURB, preferably within the first two hours in the recovery room or even in the operating theatre. As severe complications have been reported in patients with drug extravasation, safety measures should be maintained (see Section 7.7) [278,279]. To allow for optimal compliance with this Level 1 evidence, clinical teams are encouraged to explore barriers and facilitators within their practice [280]. 7.4.2.2. Additional adjuvant intravesical chemotherapy instillations The need for further adjuvant intravesical therapy depends on prognosis. In low-risk patients (Tables 6.1 and 6.2), a SI reduces the risk of recurrence and is considered to be the standard and complete treatment [268,269]. For other patients, however, a SI remains an incomplete treatment because of the considerable likelihood of recurrence and/or progression (Tables 6.1 and 6.2). Efficacy data for the following comparisons of application schemes were published. Single installation only vs. SI and further repeat instillationsIn one study, further chemotherapy instillations after SI improved RFS in intermediate-risk patients [281]. Repeat chemotherapy instillations vs. no adjuvant treatmentA large meta-analysis of 3,703 patients from 11 RCTs showed a highly significant (44%) reduction in the odds of recurrence at one year in favour of chemotherapy over TURB alone [282]. This corresponds to an absolute difference of 13–14% in the proportion of patients with recurrence. Contrary to these findings, two meta- analyses have demonstrated that BCG therapy may also reduce the risk of tumour progression [283,284] (see Section 7.2.2.1). Moreover, BCG maintenance therapy appears to be significantly better in preventing recurrences than chemotherapy [285-287] (see Section 7.2.2.1). However, BCG causes significantly more side effects than chemotherapy [287]. Single instillation + further repeat instillations vs. later repeat instillations onlyThere is evidence from several studies in intermediate-risk patients that SI might have an impact on recurrence even when further adjuvant instillations are given [288-291]. A RCT including 2,243 NMIBC patients, which compared SI of MMC with an instillation of MMC delayed two weeks after TURB (followed by further repeat instillations in both treatment arms), showed a significant reduction of 9% in the risk of recurrence at 3 years in favour of SI, from 36% to 27%. The effect was significant in the intermediate- and high-risk groups of patients receiving additional adjuvant MMC instillations [288]. Since the author’s definition of the risk groups differed significantly in the initial publication, they adapted their patient stratification in the second analysis and consistently showed improved efficacy of SI followed by repeat MMC instillations [292]. The results of this study should be considered with caution since some patients did not receive adequate therapy. Another RCT found no impact of SI with epirubicin followed by further chemotherapy or BCG instillations in a cohort of predominant HR BC patients [293]. The optimal schedule of intravesical chemotherapy instillationsThe length and frequency of repeat chemotherapy instillations is still controversial; however, it should not exceed one year [291]. A systematic review of 16 comparative studies concluded that most of the available evidence does not support the use of maintenance chemotherapy over induction only in the treatment of NMIBC [294]. 7.4.2.3. Measures to improve the efficacy of intravesical chemotherapy 7.4.2.3.1. Adjustment of pH, duration of instillation, and drug concentration Two prospective RCTs showed that optimized intravesical administration of MMC reduced recurrence rates, either by a combination of measures (higher MMC-dose, peroral sodium bicarbonate, and refraining from drinking) [295] and by adding cytosine arabinoside [296], respectively. The value of these measures in addition to alternative maintenance schedules is not known however MMC admixtures ≥ 1 mg/ml do not achieve full solubilisation which might lead to decreased drug exposure to the bladder [297]. Another trial reported that duration of a one- hour instillation of MMC was more effective compared to a 30-minute instillation, but no efficacy comparisons are available for one- vs. two-hour durations of instillation [298]. Another RCT using epirubicin has documented that concentration is more important than treatment duration [299]. In view of these data, instructions are provided (see Section 7.7). 7.4.2.3.2. Device-assisted intravesical chemotherapy Hyperthermic intravesical chemotherapyDifferent technologies which increase the temperature of instilled MMC are available. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis including four RCTs suggests similar toxicity as for BCG with maintenance schedule [300]. Microwave-induced hyperthermia effect (RITE)Promising data have been presented on enhancing the efficacy of MMC using microwave-induced hyperthermia in patients with high-risk tumours [301]. In one RCT comparing one year of BCG with one year MMC and microwave-induced hyperthermia in patients with intermediate- and high-risk BC, increased RFS at 24 months in the MMC group was demonstrated [302]. Conductive chemohyperthermiaIn an open-label phase II RCT including 259 patients, HIVEC chemo-hyperthermia failed to demonstrate an improvement in DFS at 24 months over standard adjuvant intravesical chemotherapy in intermediate-risk NMIBC (61% vs. 60%), with a higher risk of treatment discontinuation (59% vs. 89% of completed planned treatments) [303]. These results are in line with the multicentre HIVEC 1 phase 3 open label RCT, including 212 intermediate-risk patients, showing that four-month adjuvant hyperthermic MMC using the COMBAT system in intermediate-risk NMIBC was well tolerated, but was not superior to normothermic MMC at 24 months [304]. In a pilot phase II RCT on 50 high-risk NMIBCs, HIVEC™ MMC showed early outcomes comparable to BCG (24 months RFS, 86.5% with HIVEC™ and 71.8% with BCG, p = 0.184) [305]. These data need to be corroborated by further studies. Electromotive drug administrationThe efficacy of MMC using electromotive drug administration (EMDA) sequentially combined with BCG in patients with high-risk tumours has been demonstrated in one small RCT [306]. The definitive conclusion, however, needs further confirmation. For application of device-assisted instillations in patients recurring after BCG treatment, see Section 7.9.3. 7.4.2.4.
