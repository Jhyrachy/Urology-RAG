5.5. Summary of evidence and recommendations for genetic assessment of RCC. Summary of evidenceLEHereditary kidney cancer is thought to account for 5-8% of all kidney cancer cases, though that number is likely an underestimate.3In case of renal cancer, if patient’s age is 46 years or younger, and/or with bilateral or multifocal tumours and/or with a first or second-degree relative with RCC and/or with a close blood relative with a known pathogenic variant and/or with specific histologic characteristics (see text), the risk of hereditary cancer is significantly higher.3Hereditary RCC detection has unique implications for decision-making and follow-up.3 RecommendationsStrength ratingPerform a genetic evaluation in patients aged ≤ 46 years, with bilateral or multifocal tumours and/or a first- or second-degree relative with RCC and/or a close blood relative with a known pathogenic variant and/or specific histologic characteristics which suggest the presence of a hereditary form of RCC.StrongRefer patients to a cancer geneticist or to a Comprehensive Clinical Care Centre in case of suspected hereditary RCC.Strong
