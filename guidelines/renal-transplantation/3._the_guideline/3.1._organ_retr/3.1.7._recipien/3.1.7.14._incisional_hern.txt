3.1.7.14. Incisional hernia. Incisional hernia occurs in approximately 4% of open kidney transplantations. Risk factors include age, obesity, diabetes, haematoma, rejection, re-operation through the same transplant incision and use of m-TOR inhibitors. Mesh infection is a risk factor for incisional hernia recurrence [226]. Open and laparoscopic repair approaches are safe and effective [226].
