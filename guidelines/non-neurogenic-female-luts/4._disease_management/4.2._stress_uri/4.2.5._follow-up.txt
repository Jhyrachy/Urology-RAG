4.2.5. Follow-up. The follow-up of patients with SUI is dependent on the treatment given. For conservative and physical therapies, sufficient time should be allowed for the demonstration of a therapeutic effect. For pharmacological treatment, early follow-up is recommended. For most surgical interventions, short-term follow-up should be arranged to assess efficacy and identify any early postoperative complications. The Panel is supportive of long-term outcome assessment via registries and recognises the paucity of high-quality long-term data, specifically regarding complications from surgery.
