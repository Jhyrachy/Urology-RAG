3.3.5. Patient quality of life questionnaires. Quality of life (QoL) is an essential aspect of the overall management of neuro-urological patients, for example when evaluating treatment related changes on a patient’s QoL [60]. The type of bladder management has been shown to affect health-related QoL (HRQoL) mainly in patients with SCI [61,62] and MS [63], as does the presence or absence of urinary, sexual and faecal incontinence [64]. Other research has also highlighted the importance of urological treatment and its impact on the urodynamic functionality of the neuro-urological patient in determining patient QoL [65]. In recent years a proliferation in the number of questionnaires to evaluate symptoms and QoL has been seen. Condition-specific questionnaires can be used to assess symptom severity and the impact of symptoms on QoL. A patient’s overall QoL can be assessed using generic questionnaires. It is important that the questionnaire of choice has been validated in the neuro-urological population, and that it is available in the language that it is to be used in. 3.3.5.1. Available Questionnaires Three condition-specific questionnaires for urinary or bowel dysfunction and QoL have been developed specifically for adult neuro-urological patients [63]. In MS and SCI patients the Qualiveen, also available in a short version, is validated and translated into various languages [66,67]. Although several objective and subjective tools have been used to assess the influence of neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunctions (N-LUTD) on QoL in SCI, the Quality life index-SCI and Qualiveen are the only validated condition-specific outcomes that have shown consistent sensitivity [68]. The Neurogenic Bladder Symptom Score (NBSS) and its short version has been validated in neurological patients to measure urinary symptoms and their consequences [69-71]. The QoL scoring tool related to Bowel Management (QoL-BM) [72] can be used to assess bowel dysfunction in MS and SCI patients. A new tool has recently been developed to understand the reasons for poor compliance in long-term management of neurogenic patients. [73,74]. A variety of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) are available to evaluate sexual function in neuro-urological patients. However, only the Multiple Sclerosis Intimacy and Sexuality Questionnaire-15 (MSISQ-15) and -19 is supported by evidence [75-77]. In addition, several validated questionnaires that evaluate QoL and assess urinary symptoms as a subscale or question in neuro-urological patients have been identified [78] (Table 5). The condition-specific Incontinence-Quality of Life (I-QoL) questionnaire which was initially developed for the non-neurological population has now also been validated for neuro-urological patients [79]. A patient’s overall QoL can be assessed by generic HRQoL questionnaires, the most commonly used being the I-QOL, King’s Health Questionnaire (KHQ), or the Short Form 36-item and 12-item Health Survey Questionnaires (SF-36, SF-12) [80]. In addition, the quality-adjusted life year (QALY), quantifies outcomes, by weighing years of life spent in a specified health state, adjusted by a factor representing the value placed by society or patients on their specific health state [81]. No evidence was found for which validated questionnaires are the most appropriate for use, since no quality criteria for validated questionnaires have been assessed [80].
