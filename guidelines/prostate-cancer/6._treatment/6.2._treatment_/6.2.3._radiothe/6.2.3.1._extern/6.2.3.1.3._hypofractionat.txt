6.2.3.1.3. Hypofractionation. Fractionated RT utilises differences in the DNA repair capacity of normal and tumour tissue and slowly proliferating cells are very sensitive to an increased dose per fraction [656]. A meta-analysis of 25 studies including > 14,000 patients concluded that since PCa has a slow proliferation rate, hypofractionated RT could be more effective than conventional fractions of 1.8–2 Gy [657]. Hypofractionation (HFX) has the added advantage of being more convenient for the patient at lower cost. Moderate HFX is defined as RT with 2.5–3.4 Gy/fx. Several studies report on moderate HFX applied in various techniques also including HT in part [658-665]. A SR concluded that studies on moderate HFX (2.5–3.4 Gy/fx) delivered with conventional 3D-CRT/IMRT have sufficient follow-up to support the safety of this therapy but long-term efficacy data are still lacking [664]. These results were confirmed by a Cochrane review on moderate HFX for clinically localised PCa [666]. Eleven studies were included (n = 8,278) with a median follow-up of 72 months showing little or no difference in PCa-specific survival (HR: 1.00). Based on 4 studies (n = 3,848), HFX probably makes little or no difference to late radiation GU toxicity (RR: 1.05) or GI toxicity (RR: 1.1), but this conclusion is based on relatively short follow-up, and ten to 15-year data will be required to confirm these findings. Moderate HFX should only be done by experienced teams using high-quality EBRT using IGRT and IMRT/VMAT and published phase III protocols should be adhered to (Table 6.1.7).

Ultra-HFX has been defined as RT with > 3.4 Gy per fraction [665]. It requires IGRT and (ideally) stereotactic body RT (SBRT). Table 6.1.8 provides an overview of selected studies investigating its role in treating predominantly intermediate risk localised disease. Short-term biochemical control (5-years) is comparable to conventional fractionation. However, there are concerns about high-grade GU and rectal toxicity and full long-term side effects may not yet be known [664,668]. In the HYPO-RT-PC randomised trial by Widmark et al., (n = 1,200), no difference in failure-free survival was seen for conventional or ultra-HFX but acute grade ≥ 2 GU toxicity was 23% vs. 28% (p = 0.057), favouring conventional fractionation. There were no significant differences in long-term toxicity [668]. A SR by Jackson et al., included 38 studies with 6,116 patients who received RT with < 10 fractions and ≥ 5 Gy per fraction. Five and seven-year biochemical recurrence-free survival (BRFS) rates were 95.3% and 93.7%, respectively, and estimated late grade ≥ 3 GU and GI toxicity rates were 2.0% and 1.1%, respectively [669]. The authors conclude that there is sufficient evidence to support SBRT as a standard treatment option for localised PCa, even though the median follow-up in this review was only 39 months and it included at least one trial (HYPO-RT-PC) which used 3D-CRT in 80% and IMRT/VMAT in the remainder for ultra-HFX. In their review on SBRT, Cushman et al., evaluated 14 trials, including 2,038 patients and concluded that despite a lack of long-term follow-up and the heterogeneity of the available evidence, prostate SBRT affords appropriate biochemical control with few high-grade toxicities [670]. In the Intensity-modulated fractionated RT vs. stereotactic body RT for PCa (PACE-B) trial, acute grade ≥ 2 GU or GI toxicities did not differ significantly between conventional fractionation and ultra- HFX [671]. At two years, treatment was well tolerated in both arms with no differences in RTOG ≥ Grade 2 GU or GI toxicities, but clinician scoring of urinary toxicity using CTCAE and patient reported Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC)-26 urinary bother scores were both higher in the SBRT arm suggesting SBRT may increase moderate but not severe urinary symptoms post-teatment [672]. Adopting planning dose constraints to the penile bulb might minimise ED, especially in younger patients (Table 6.1.8) [673]. First results of a small (n = 30) randomised phase-II trial in intermediate-risk PCa of ‘ultra-high single dose RT’ (SDRT) with 24 Gy compared with an ultra HFX stereotactic body RT regime with 5x9 Gy, have been published [674].
