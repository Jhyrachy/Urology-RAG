11.3. Diagnostic work-up. Important treatment decisions are based on the results of semen analysis and most studies indicate semen parameters are a surrogate outcome for male fertility. However, a semen analysis per se cannot distinguish fertile from infertile men [1540]. The Guidelines panel concludes that a comprehensive andrological examination is always indicated in infertile couples, both if semen analysis shows abnormalities and in men with normal sperm parameters as compared with reference values [1541-1543]. Focused evaluation of male patients should include: a medical and reproductive history; physical examination; semen analysis â€“ with strict adherence to World Health Organization (WHO) reference values for human semen characteristics [1544,1545], and hormonal evaluation [1546]. Other investigations (e.g., genetic analysis and imaging) may be required depending on the clinical features and semen parameters.
