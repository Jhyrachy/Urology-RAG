3.1. History and physical examination. Taking a thorough clinical history is fundamental to the process of clinical evaluation. Despite the lack of high-level evidence to support it, there is universal agreement that taking a history should be the first step in the assessment of anyone with LUTS. The history should include a full evaluation of LUTS, as well as sexual, gastrointestinal, and neurological symptoms. The history should help to categorise LUTS as storage, voiding and post-micturition symptoms, and classify UI as SUI, UUI, MUI or overflow incontinence; the latter being defined as “the complaint of UI in the symptomatic presence of an excessively (over-) full bladder (no cause identified)” [16]. The history should also identify patients who need referral to an appropriate clinic/specialist. These may include patients with associated pain, haematuria, history of recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI), pelvic surgery or radiotherapy, constant leakage suggesting a fistula (see Section 4.8), new-onset enuresis or suspected neurological disease. A neurological, obstetric, and gynaecological history may help to understand the underlying cause and identify factors that may affect treatment decisions. Guidance on history-taking and diagnosis in relation to UTIs, neuro-urological conditions and chronic pelvic pain (CPP) can be found in the relevant EAU Guidelines [9,17,18]. Patients should also be asked about other co-morbidity as well as smoking status, previous surgical procedures, and current medications, as these may affect LUTS. There is also little evidence from clinical trials that carrying out a clinical examination improves outcomes, but widespread consensus suggests that clinical examination remains an essential part of assessment of patients with LUTS. Examination should include abdominal examination, to detect an enlarged urinary bladder or other abdominal mass, and digital examination of the vagina and/or rectum. Pelvic examination in women includes assessment of oestrogen status, pelvic floor muscle (PFM) function and careful assessment of any associated pelvic organ prolapse (POP). A cough stress test is necessary to look for SUI. Among women with genital prolapse, the cough test was found to show good agreement with urodynamic studies (UDS) in the detection of SUI [19]. Urethral mobility and PFM contraction strength can also be assessed. A focused neuro-urological examination should also be routinely undertaken. 3.1.1.
