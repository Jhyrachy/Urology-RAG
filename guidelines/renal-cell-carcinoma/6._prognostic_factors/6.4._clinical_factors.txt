6.4. Clinical factors. Clinical factors include performance status (PS), local symptoms, cachexia, anaemia, platelet count, neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, C-reactive protein (CRP) [213], albumin, and various indices deriving from these factors such as the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) [103,214-219] (LE: 3). As a marker of systemic inflammatory response, a high pre-operative NLR has been associated with poor prognosis [220], but there is significant heterogeneity in the data and no agreement on the optimal prognostic cut-off. Even though obesity is an aetiological factor for RCC, it has also been observed to provide prognostic information. A high body mass index (BMI) appears to be associated with improved survival outcomes in both non-metastatic and metastatic RCC [221-223]. This association is linear with regards to cancer-specific mortality (CSM), while obese RCC patients show increasing all-cause mortality with increasing BMI [224]. There is also evolving evidence on the prognostic value of body composition indices measured on cross-sectional imaging, such as sarcopenia and fat accumulation [219,225,226].
