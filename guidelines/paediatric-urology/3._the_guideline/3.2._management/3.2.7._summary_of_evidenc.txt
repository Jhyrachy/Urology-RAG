3.2.7. Summary of evidence and recommendations for the management of undescended testes. Summary of evidenceLEAn undescended testis justifies treatment early in life to avoid loss of spermatogenic potential.2aA failed or delayed orchidopexy may increase the risk of testicular malignancy later in life.2aThe earlier the treatment, the lower the risk of impaired fertility and testicular cancer.2aIn unilateral undescended testis, fertility rate is reduced whereas paternity rate is not.1bIn bilateral undescended testes, fertility and paternity rates are impaired.1bThe treatment of choice for undescended testis is surgical replacement in the scrotum.1bThe palpable testis is usually treated surgically using an inguinal approach.2bThe non-palpable testis is most commonly approached laparoscopically.2bThere is no consensus on the use of hormonal treatment.2b RecommendationsStrength ratingDo not offer medical or surgical treatment for retractile testes instead undertake close follow-up on a yearly basis until puberty.StrongPerform surgical orchidolysis and orchidopexy before the age of twelve months, and by eighteen months at the latest.StrongEvaluate male neonates with bilateral non-palpable testes for possible disorders of sex development.StrongPerform a diagnostic laparoscopy to locate an intra-abdominal testicle.StrongHormonal therapy in unilateral undescended testes is of no benefit for future paternity.StrongOffer endocrine treatment in case of bilateral undescended testes.WeakInform the patient/caregivers about the increased risk of a later malignancy with an undescended testis in a post-pubertal boy or older and discuss removal in case of a contralateral normal testis in a scrotal position.Weak
