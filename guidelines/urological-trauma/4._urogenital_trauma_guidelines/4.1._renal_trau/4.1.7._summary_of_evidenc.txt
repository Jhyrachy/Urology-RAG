4.1.7. Summary of evidence and recommendations for evaluation and management of renal trauma. Summary of evidenceLEVital signs on admission give the most reliable indication of the urgency of the situation.3Special consideration should be given to patients with a solitary kidney and pre-existing renal disease.4Haematuria is a key finding following renal trauma; although, it may not be present in certain situations.3A multiphase CT scan is the best method for the diagnosis and staging of renal injuries in haemodynamically stable patients.3Haemodynamic stability is the primary criterion for selecting patients for non-operative management.3Ureteric stenting in stable asymptomatic Grade 4 renal injuries is not necessary.3Selective angioembolisation is effective in patients with active bleeding from renal injury, without other indications for immediate abdominal operation.3Renal reconstruction should be attempted if haemorrhage is controlled and there is sufficient viable renal parenchyma.3Iatrogenic renal injuries are procedure-dependent (1.8-15%); the most common injuries are vascular.3Limited literature exists with regard to long-term consequences of renal trauma. Current follow-up includes physical examination, urinalysis, diagnostic imaging, serum creatinine, as well as annual blood pressure monitoring to diagnose renovascular hypertension.4 RecommendationsStrength ratingEvaluationAssess haemodynamic stability upon admission.StrongRecord past renal surgery, and known pre-existing renal abnormalities (ureteropelvic junction obstruction, solitary kidney, urolithiasis).StrongTest for haematuria in a patient with suspected renal injury.StrongPerform a multiphase computed tomography (CT) scan in trauma patients with:visible haematuria;non-visible haematuria and one episode of hypotension;a history of rapid deceleration injury and/or significant associated injuries;penetrating trauma;clinical signs suggesting renal trauma e.g. flank pain, abrasions, fractured ribs, abdominal distension and/or a mass and tenderness.StrongManagementManage stable patients with blunt renal trauma non-operatively with close monitoring and re-imaging as required.StrongManage isolated Grade 1-4 stab and low-velocity gunshot wounds in stable patients non-operatively.StrongUse selective angioembolisation for active renal bleeding if there are no other indications for immediate surgical exploration.StrongInsert urinary system drainage (ureteral stenting, nephrostomy) or perirenal drainage in cases of persistent or symptomatic urinary leak.StrongProceed with renal exploration in the presence of:persistent haemodynamic instability;Grade 5 vascular or penetrating injury;expanding or pulsatile peri-renal haematoma.StrongAttempt renal reconstruction if haemorrhage is controlled and there is sufficient viable renal parenchyma.WeakRepeat imaging in high-grade and penetrating injuries and in cases of fever, worsening flank pain, or falling haematocrit.StrongFollow-up approximately three months after major renal injury with urinalysis, individualised radiological investigation eg.: nuclear scintigraphy, CT or ultrasound, blood pressure measurement and renal function tests. Longer term annual follow-up for blood pressure is recommended.Weak
